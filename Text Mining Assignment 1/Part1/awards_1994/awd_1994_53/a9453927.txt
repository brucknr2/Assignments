Abstract    :
              9453927  Hardwick    This three year project would develop a set of teacher
              instructional materials for getting more women interested in geography.  The
              materials will be based on a pilot program done earlier by the National Council
              for Geographic Education.    In the first year, 15 experienced teachers would
              be paired with 15 much less experienced teachers in the teaching  of gender
              equity in geography.  The first workshop would be held in the east(Temple
              University).   A second workshop with another set of 30 teachers would be held
              the second year in the west(San Diego State University). This workshop
              arrangement is to provide easy access to African American and Puerto Rican 
              women in the east at Temple, and Hispanic and Asian women in the west in
              California.  Each workshop will consist of three weeks of intensive work.  A
              one week intensive preworkshop will be held for those less well prepared
              teachers.  During each three week workshop will train teachers in instructional
              strategies that enhance the performance in geography of ALL students in
              secondary school geography and social studies classes, paying particular
              attention to the needs of female students of diverse ethnic and racial
              backgrounds.  The first year will produce the instructional materials that
              integrate geographic content on gender and ethnic minority groups and exemplify
              appropriate teaching strategies.   These materials will be tested, revised and
              introduced to the teachers in the workshops  during the summer or years 1 and
              2.  The cost share of this project is 20.5% of the support from the Foundation.
