Abstract    :
              This Presidential Faculty Fellow award funds research and teaching activity of a
                neuroscientist.  Research concentrates on how large assemblies of neurons  
              function, using as an the retina of the eye as a model system to study the  
              complex interactions for collective signaling.  Novel instrumentation is used
              to   monitor the simultaneous activity of many nerve cells at once, to
              determine how   a visual image is processed into a signal to be sent to the
              brain by neural   pathways to visual centers.  The role of correlated neural
              activity also appears to   be important in development of a properly functional
              retina, and these studies   explore how such mechanisms may be important in the
              adult retina.  Teaching   emphasizes to undergraduates and to graduates how the
              nervous system acts to   integrate complex functions, with an outreach
              component into the local high   schools.  The impact of this project will be
              strong on visual neuroscience and   computational neuroscience, and likely to
              other areas of brain information   processing; the teaching component will be
              important to the scientific   development of students over a wide range of ages
              and potential careers.
