Abstract    :
              9453407  Nwankpa  The research will focus on two fundamental issues in the area
              of  large-scale power systems:         1.   Stochastic-Process Theory for
              Stability Assessment of Power       Systems  The main objective is to provide a
              more realistic set of  assessment and control tools, through the use of indices
              and  models for stochastic robustness and dynamic uncertainty of power 
              systems.  These tools seem to have two fundamental advantages  over existing
              deterministic analysis: (i) they are more  realistic, and more appropriate for
              the existing motor loads,  bang-bang controlled heating devices, air
              conditioners and modern  power switching devices; and (ii) they take full
              advantages of  advances in the study of stochastic robustness that is yet to be
               used in power systems.    2.  Improving Electric Power Quality  The plan is to
              work on a high-speed high-power switching for  custom power applications, which
              will provide a partial solution  to increased number of disturbances in power
              distribution  systems.  The system is a distribution system controller, based 
              on an optically-controlled high-power switch.     This research effort will
              closely follow a teaching plan which  consists of developing two new facilities
              to supplant existing  laboratories.  They are:  The Interconnected Power System
               Laboratory  -   For the study of power generation/transmission.  The
              Distribution Automation and Custom Power Laboratory - For the  study of power
              distribution/consumption.   ***
