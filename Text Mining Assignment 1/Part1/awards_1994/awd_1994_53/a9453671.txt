Abstract    :
              9453671  Kleiman    This project focuses on two current issues in American
              education:   reform in mathematics education led by the NCTM Standards and the 
              need to serve a linguistically and culturally diverse (LCD) student 
              population.  The implementation of the unit Languate of Numbers  developed by
              EDC under NSF award number ESI-9054677 is evaluated in  schools served by the
              California Middle School Mathematics  Renaissance of the California State
              Systemic Initiative.  This  unit, designed for sixth grade, includes material
              on number  representational systems, multiple representations of numbers, and 
              number representational devices.  In addition, it focuses on  investigation,
              invention, symbolization, and communicating  mathematically.  The evaluation
              consists of classroom observations,  individual and focus group interviews with
              teachers, students,  administrators and parents as well as review of student
              work.  The  outcome is general principles for the design and implementation of 
              instructional materials for LCD students and guidance for teachers 
              implementing similar instructional materials.
