Abstract    :
              9453802  Newman    ABSTRACT    The Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. will produce
              four half-hour television specials which focus on kids testing and evaluating
              popular products.  This "real world" approach can motivate children to learn
              science and mathematics concepts and to develop problem-solving skills in the
              process of tackling everyday consumer problems.  The approach is particularly
              effective with youth who are not print-oriented, who watch a lot of television,
              and who may find "formal" science and mathematics inaccessible.  Outreach
              materials for viewers and for use in formal classes will extent the impact of
              the project.    The PI and Project Director will be Joyce Newman, Director of
              Consumer Reports TV.  Susan Markowitz, who produced the successful pilot
              program will be Producer and Edward Groth, a biologist who serves as Consumers
              Union Associate Technical Director for Public Service Projects, will be the
              Senior Science Advisor.  Susan Isenberg will be a major science education
              advisor.  Ms. Isenberg is an IBM Education Fellow and consultant to a number of
              New York and New Jersey school districts.  She has a B.S. in Science Education,
              an M.S. in Education, and has been a teacher for 25 years.  This core group
              will work closely with in-house scientists and education experts as well as
              with an advisory committee established for the project.
