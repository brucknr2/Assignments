Abstract    :
              9453881  Gerace               A classroom communication system is being
              developed as a catalyst  for promoting a more dynamic and constructivist
              classroom  environment.  Students will not only engage in cooperative learning 
              activities, but also communicate their understanding to the  instructor,
              thereby permitting the instructor to respond to  students' specific
              instructional needs.   The project is a  collaborative among science and
              mathematics instructors at the  University of Massachusetts at Amherst Regional
              High School,  educational researchers and curriculum developers at the UMASS 
              Scientific Reasoning Research Institute, and educational  technologists at
              Better education Incorporated.  The project  focuses primarily on the subject
              matter appropriate for a one year  course at the high school or college level. 
              The complete system  will be developed, consisting of hardware, documented
              software, and  curriculum materials. Exemplar materials will also be developed
              in  mathematics and chemistry.  A primary aspect of the project is also 
              evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of the classroom  communication
              system as an instructional approach.
