Abstract    :
              9453024  Blatt    ABSTRACT     Blackside, Inc. is producing a television series
              and an outreach component about minority scientists.  The goals of the six-hour
              prime-time series, "Breakthrough: People of Color in Science," are to raise the
              consciousness of the general public that is largely unaware of the significant
              contribution of scientists of color and to provide role models that will
              encourage young people to consider science and engineering careers.  The
              programs will feature the work of contemporary African-American, Latino and
              Native American scientists and engineers who are active in cell biology,
              astrophysics, applied mathematics and other fields of science.  The stories of
              their scientific achievements will present both women and men, old and young,
              at different stages of their careers, and will explore the professional,
              educational and social worlds they live and work in.      Viewers will have
              immediate access to a comprehensive follow-up effort that will connect them
              with local, regional and national opportunities in informal science education. 
              Blackside will collect information from existing resources and institutions as
              well using source material from several extensively researched databases geared
              toward minority students.  Using all of this information, Blackside will create
              a metadatabase that will connect teachers, parents, mentors, and students to a
              rich variety of educational programs:  extracurricular classes, mentoring
              programs, national science contests, teacher training workshops, and a myriad
              of on-line services.  To ensure immediate access and, where possible, to
              customize the information to viewers needs, Blackside will disseminate it
              through a variety of means:  an 800-number with a direct fax-back capability,
              an on-line service, a CD-ROM, and a printed packet delivered by mail.  A
              principal target audience is gatekeepers in students' lives:  parents,
              teachers, and scientists interested in becoming mentors.  The target audience
              also includes students from fourth th rough twelfth grades.       Joseph Blatt
              will serve a PI for this project and co-executive producer for the television
              series.  His previous experience include serving as executive producer of
              "Scientific American FRONTIERS" and as a producer/director for several NOVA
              programs.  He also has been executive producer for three television
              series/college credit courses in mathematics.  Henry Hampton will be the other
              co-executive producer.  He was the creator and executive producer of the
              14-hour, award winning series, "Eyes on the Prize," about America's civil
              rights movement.  The principal educational consultant will be Ceasar McDowell,
              assistant professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. 
              Michael Ambrosino, the original executive producer of NOVA, will be the
              principal science television consultant.
