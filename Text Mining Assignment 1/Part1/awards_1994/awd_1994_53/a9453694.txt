                 INSTITUTION:   The University of Colorado, Boulder    TITLE:   Conference on
              the Cultural Needs of and Strategies for Educating American Indian  Precollege
              Students in Science, Mathematics, and Technology    This project is for a
              conference to be held over three days and three nights to explore cultural 
              concerns and issues which prevent Native American children from fully
              participating in science  and mathematics.  PI's from current NSF funded
              projects who have significant Native American  population will be invited to
              attend. ( about 30)  In addition there will be another 16 Native  Americans who
              have special expertise in this subject who will be participant leaders.  The 
              conference will generate guidelines to address cultural needs of Native
              Americans.  A document  describing the outcomes, guidelines and recommendations
              will be published to assist future PI's,   teachers, and other interested
              parties as they develop their teaching strategies and curriculum  materials. 
              The conference is to take place on May 19 through May 22 at the University of 
              Colorado in Boulder, CO.
