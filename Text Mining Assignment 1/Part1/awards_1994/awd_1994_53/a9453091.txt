Abstract    :
              9453091  Lewis    The goal of this project is to help children understand
              phenomena  in science by allowing them and the adults with whom they work to 
              create and manipulate animated pictorial models.  The project  combines
              intensive study of modelling and its impact in an  elementary school setting
              with the development of advanced  computing technology, the pictorial rewrite
              system, that make model  creation dramatically easier than it is today.  The
              technology will  support interactive classroom discussion, in which models can
              be  created, manipulated, and compared in response to student questions  and
              suggestions.  It will and also support project work by  individual students or
              teams working on topics of their own  selection.  ***
