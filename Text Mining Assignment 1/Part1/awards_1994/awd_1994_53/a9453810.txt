Abstract    :
              9453810  White    The Lawrence Hall of Science will develop a 3000 sq. ft. 
              traveling interactive chemistry exhibit  in which visitors will  conduct a
              variety of basic chemical tests within the motivational  genre of solving a
              mystery.  Chem-Mystery will invite visitors  into an Old House facade where two
              non-violent mysteries have  occurred.  Visitors will chose a mystery (either
              the case of the  missing toy boat for youngsters or the case of the missing
              money  for older children and adults) to solve.  After learning the  facts
              surrounding the case from videos of the chief detective and  the suspects,
              visitors will collect evidence from the scene of  the mystery and then proceed
              to the Forensics Laboratory.  The  Lab will contain 15 hands-on stations where
              visitors explore  fundamental chemistry concepts while using chemistry as a
              tool to  analyze clues.  Complementary educational materials will be 
              developed.  A 20 page Going Further Guide will contain activities  that can be
              done at home using techniques introduced in the  exhibit.  Teacher workshops
              will be held to introduce teachers to  concepts in the exhibit and methods on
              how to incorporate the  exhibit activities in their curricular agenda.  These
              materials  plus other general set-up information will be included in an 
              Exhibit Installation Handbook.  After opening to the public at  the LHS in
              January 1996, it will begin its tour in October, 1996  to nine US science
              centers.  It has the potential of reaching  about 800,000 people during the
              twenty-seven month tour.  The  exhibit design will be reviewed for universal
              accessibility.  It  will be produced by the staff of the Lawrence Hall of
              Science and  circulated by ASTC.  ***
