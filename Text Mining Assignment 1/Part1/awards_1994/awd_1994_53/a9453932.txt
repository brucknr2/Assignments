Abstract    :
              9453932  Reys    RESHAPING MATHEMATICS IN THE MIDDLE GRADES IN MISSOURI:  A
              MODEL TO IMPROVE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM, TEACHING, AND LEARNING    The
              University of Missouri - Columbia, in collaboration with Missouri school
              districts, will initiate and support the effective implementation of four
              NSF-funded middle school mathematics curricula (Mathematics in Context,
              Connected Math, Seeing and Thinking Mathematically, Six Through Eight
              Mathematics) in Missouri schools.  The three-year project targets directly 160
              teachers and administrators representing 15 Missouri school districts.  In Year
              1, 60 middle school teachers/administrators in teams and four regional
              associates explore the four curricula through a one-week summer institute that
              emphasizes the vision of the NCTM Standards; four three-day conferences, where
              each conference emphasizes one of the curricular projects and is led by
              representatives of that project; and implementation of at least one unit of
              study from each of the four curricula by each middle school teacher.  In Year
              2, 100 additional "colleague" teachers from the 15 school districts join the
              summer institute.  The expanded teams receive training on the specific
              curriculum chosen by their faculty to be used in their school.   In Year 3, the
              project focuses on dissemination conferences and implementation of the new
              curricula.      Evaluation of project activities includes monitoring the
              professional growth of teachers/administrators as they interact with peers and
              staff via project meetings and electronic communications, and the impact of the
              new curricula on teacher views of mathematics at the middle school level. 
              Cost-sharing from the University of Missouri and from partner school districts
              represents 59% of the NSF award amount.
