Abstract    :
              9453187  Ervin  The National Consortium for Educational Access (NCEA) activities
              will focus on developing the  foundation for a network and specific procedures
              to recruit, train, and place minority  transitioning military personnel (TMPs)
              into teaching careers at the elementary and secondary  school levels in
              mathematics and science.  The Armed Services Transition to Education Program 
              (ASTEP) will help military personnel to become certified teachers because it
              will emphasize the  following:         -Recruiting minority male TMPs with at
              least associate degrees;       -Providing them with guidance in preparing for a
              teaching career while on active duty;       -Providing them with financial
              support for a baccalaureate degree education;       -Certifying TMPs in
              elementary, middle, and high school science and mathematics; and       
              -Placing newly licensed teachers in permanent positions in urban schools and
              other  districts with sgnificant populations of minority and at-risk students. 
                There is an acute shortage of minority male teachers at all levels of
              American education from  kindergarten through high school, especially in
              mathematics and science. ASTEP will be  designed to help alleviate this
              shortage by substantially expanding the pool of qualified minority  teachers in
              these critical fields.
