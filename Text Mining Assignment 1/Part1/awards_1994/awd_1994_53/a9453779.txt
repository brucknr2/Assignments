Abstract    :
              9453779  Jordon    The Science Center of Connecticut will develop, evaluate, and
               install 57 mathematical exhibit activities in its new 160,000 sq.  ft. exhibit
              facility.  These activities will engage visitors in  learning how math is an
              integral part of daily life and a  necessary skill in many careers.  Eight math
              topics will be  treated: probability and statistics; relative scale; geometry; 
              symmetry; math puzzles; chaos and fractals; numbers,  measurements, and
              calculations; and estimations.  The hands-on  activities will range from
              involvement with  low-tech to high-  tech, computerized activities.  The target
              audience is people  nine and up and it will be available to the museums 500,000
               annual visitors.  The mathematics activities will be distributed  throughout
              the museum and math will serve as a integrating theme  for all the museum's
              exhibits.  The topics are aligned with  Connecticut s SSI program which focuses
              on applied mathematics in  context of the science disciplines.  Within the
              state, plans are  taking shape to link with Connecticut Public Television to 
              broadcast electronic field trips to the museum through Knowledge  Network. 
              Nationally, museum staff members will make  presentations at both museum and
              mathematics education meetings  to other museum professionals. The concept of
              thematic  integration throughout the museum will be disseminated through  the
              state and the nation.  ***
