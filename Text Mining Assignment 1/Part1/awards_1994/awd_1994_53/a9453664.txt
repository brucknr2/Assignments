Abstract    :
              9453664  Navarro  The El Paso Urban Systemic Initiative (EPUSI) has as its  core
              a vision that seeks to provide the mathematics and  science fundamentals which
              will permit all students to  participate fully in a technological society and
              enable a  significantly greater number of El Paso's students to pursue  careers
              in mathematics, science, engineering, and  technology.  EPUSI will unite the
              three school districts, El  Paso Independent, Ysleta and Socorro, that serve
              over 85% of  all of the children in the El Paso region, in the  development and
              implementation of a standards-based, K-12  science, mathematics and technology
              curriculum appropriate  to meet the needs of El Paso's culturally-diverse,
              bilingual  student population.  The curriculum will be developed by  teams of
              curriculum supervisors, teachers and science and  mathematics professionals. 
              Through joint effort, the  districts will provide teacher enhancement,
              implement  technology to support the new curriculum, align policies and 
              redirect their resources to support EPUSI.  The Initiative  will be managed by
              El Paso Collaborative for Academic  Excellence in concert with the three school
              districts.  Science and mathematics professionals from the University of  Texas
              El Paso (UTEP) will help design the curriculum and  provide school level
              coaching, mentoring and other support.  Programs developed by the Comprehensive
              Regional Center for  Minorities UTEP, will be incorporated within the EPUSI.
