Abstract    :
              9550710  Miller  The primary goal of this RIMI proposal is increased entry and 
              retention of minorities into the environmental engineering program  at Wayne
              State University (WSU).  The project proposes combining  existing research
              strengths in modeling and remediation of soil and  groundwater contamination
              within the Departments of Civil and  Environmental Engineering (CEE) and
              Chemical Engineering (ChE) in  order to reach this goal.  Faculty from these
              Departments will  combine efforts to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to
              the  problem of soil and water pollution from ruptured or leaking waste 
              containment systems.  The scope of the research is purposely broad,  in order
              to involve the minority students/researchers in a number  of focuses research
              areas, each relating directly to pollution  resulting from land-based waste
              containment systems.  The WSU  research experience will be enhanced through a
              summer internship  program at The University of Michigan.  In addition,
              industrial  internships will be used to increase the number of minorities 
              impacted by this program.  Such practical research training will  significantly
              increase student retention in this program.  ***
