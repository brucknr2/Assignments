Abstract    :

              Illinois State University (ISU), Eastern Illinois University (EIU), and Western
              Illinois University (WIU) to develop a network of universities, community
              colleges, and public schools across Central Illinois devoted to the improvement
              of teacher education activities in the region served.  Specific efforts are
              targeted in the project goals to increase the active role of faculty from pure
              and applied mathematics and science in the teaching/learning process of
              prospective and inservice teachers and to further communication among all
              parties with an interest in mathematics and science education in the schools
              and in teacher education.  The project is providing for (a) a policy conference
              for school administrators; (b) development of at least two new courses in
              mathematics and science for prospective teachers of elementary and secondary
              school mathematics and science on each of the three university campuses; (c)
              creation of regional groups of university, community college, and school
              faculty to plan and develop better programs of teacher education for each of
              the three regions (ISU, EIU, and WIU); (d) development of distance education
              methods for providing assistance to schools; and (e) dissemination of previous
              and currently developed materials for teacher preservice education and faculty
              development for practicing teachers.
