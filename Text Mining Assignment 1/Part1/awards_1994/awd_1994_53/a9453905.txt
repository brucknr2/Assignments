Abstract    :
              HRD-9453905  Dr. Collier, Harvest   Melba Ware/Co-PI  University of MO-Rolla 
              Rolla, MO  64501    "St. Louis Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities"   
              The St. Louis Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities is a  consortium
              organized through the cooperation of the University of  Missouri-St. Louis, the
              University of Missouri-Rolla, the St. Louis  Community College, Harris-Stowe
              State College, and the St. Louis  Public School System.  The center's mission
              is to develop and  conduct coordinated school-based and external strategies
              that  result in the academic preparation of urban minority students to  enter
              undergraduate studies in the sciences, mathematics and  engineering.  During
              the last 4 years, the implementation of CRCM  activities at the middle and high
              school levels has provided  opportunities for involving students in formal and
              informal science  and mathematics enrichment, inquiry based learning
              experiences,  career orientation, and scientific research activities.  The high
               school research program has resulted in dramatic increases in  student
              interest and participation in competitive science and  mathematics programs. 
              This includes historic participation of St.  Louis minority students in local,
              regional, state and national  science competitions.    In 1992, 120 students
              exited the St. Louis CRCM pipeline, as high  school graduates.  A recent survey
              of that group indicates that 85  students are in some level of post-secondary
              education; 62 students  are currently majoring in mathematics, a science or
              engineering  related area 55 students are pursuing B.S. degrees in the hard 
              sciences, mathematics or engineering.  These results and the  growing
              participation of the community strongly suggest that such  efforts are needed
              and can be an effective means to increase the  pool of qualified minority
              students for SME careers.
