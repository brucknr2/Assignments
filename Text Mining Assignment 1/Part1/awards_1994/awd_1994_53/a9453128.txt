Abstract    :
              ***  9453128  McCully    This is a five-year proposal to provide 100 hours of
              teacher enhancement for the 2040 K-8 teachers of mathematics and science in
              Fresno Unified School District (California).  The district program will focus
              on curriculum on the California adoption list with enhancement being done in
              conjunction with the California Renaissance project (SSI) and teams involving
              the California Mathematics Project and California Science Project.  Schools
              will be involved as units of enhancement with no school starting mathematics
              and science at the same time.  This project is being done in close coordination
              with the Fresno Urban Systemic Initiative.  Cost-sharing is listed at $
              8,750,000 or 150% of the project.  ***
