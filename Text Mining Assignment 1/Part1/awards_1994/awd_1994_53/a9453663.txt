Abstract    :
              9453663  Cortines  The New York Urban System Initiative (NYUSI) has at its core
              a  vision that seeks to improve the mathematics, science and  technology
              literacy of all K-12 students in the New York Public  Schools.  It has forged a
              strong partnership between the public  schools and the City University of New
              York (CUNY).  The  initiative has two major thrusts: (1) the establishment of
              250  Mathematics, Science, and Technology (MST) leadership schools  (Cluster
              Schools) over the next five years, and the expansion of  the Initiative to 250
              additional schools through a paired school  strategy; (2) the undertaking of
              exemplary MST reforms at the  initial 250 school sites through the cooperative
              efforts of the  Board of Education, CUNY, business and industry, and other 
              stakeholders.  In addition to working with a specific set of  cluster schools
              and paired schools, certain essential certain  citywide elements will reach all
              schools.  These elements include  implementation of a citywide MST curriculum
              framework;  development of a technology network that links the Board of 
              Education, CUNY, the public schools and major NYUSI partnership  members; and
              models of exemplary mathematics and science  education projects.  The New York
              USI places strong emphasis on  grass roots MST systemic change through the
              cluster schools,  coupled with effective core leadership and high standards for
              all  participating schools.  The commitment to site-based ownership  reflects
              the perspective of New York State's New Compact for  Learning and the New York
              Statewide Systemic Initiative.
