Abstract    :
                The Memphis Urban Systemic Initiative (MUSI) utilizes mathematics and science
              education  reform as the vehicle for system-wide improvement by initiating new
              policies and practices  that focus on academic content, graduation
              requirements, quality teaching and resource  reallocation and development.  The
              MUSI will employ the following strategies: (1) the use of  site based
              management; (2) focusing the City's educational resources on the Urban Systemic
               Initiative (USI) plan; (3) aligning policies with USI goals and strategies;
              (4) customizing  professional development; (5) establishing broad and diverse
              community partnerships; (6)  raising expectations for student performance; and
              (7) increasing the rigor and quality of  curriculum and instruction.  The
              Memphis USI seeks to realize its vision in the challenging  context of today's
              urban schools, a context characterized by increasing violence, socio-  economic
              inequities, and over-taxed social service systems.  The completion of a broadly
               supported and very promising citywide USI plan have raised optimism that the
              USI will be  the force that moves the reform effort.
