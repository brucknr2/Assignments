Abstract    :
              9453139  Strum    The goal of this project is to encourage girls from high
              schools and women from colleges to  enroll and remain in computer science
              programs.  It is a cooperative effort of women faculty  at the College of
              Staten Island (CSI) and Staten Island Technical High School (SI TECH).  The 
              project initiates the expansion of an existing program operating at the college
              to the high school  level, and lays the foundation for broader expansion to
              additional colleges within the City  University of New York (CUNY) system.  CSI
              undergraduate women are to develop a  computerized tracking system for SI Tech
              graduates.  CSI women undergraduates and alumnae  are to give lectures at SI
              Tech.  Stipends are to be provided for undergraduate women to work  on summer
              research with faculty mentors.  A women and computers "exposition" is to be
              hosted  with high school students and their parents invited.  SI Tech is to
              host a seminar where CSI  women faculty and students participate in a panel
              discussion with SI Tech girls in the audience.   An "adopt-a-high
              school-student" program, where undergraduates at CSI will mentor high school 
              students, is to be initiated.  An electronic questionnaire to capture
              information from the student  participants is to be developed.  A questionnaire
              and a tracking system are to be used for  outcome analysis.  High school and
              college information kits are to be produced and  disseminated.  ***
