Abstract    :
              9453701  McCauley-Bell       The research proposes to investigate the use of
              fuzzy set  theory to identify and model the primary elements that are 
              necessary to describe human performance.  The research also aims at 
              investigating the use of fuzzy set theory to evaluate the  feasibility of
              linguistic hedges and natural language interfaces in  human computer
              interaction.
