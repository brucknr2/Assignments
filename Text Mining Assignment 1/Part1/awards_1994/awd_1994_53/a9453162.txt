Abstract    :
              9453162  Miller    The Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement project
              is  the Bozeman School district's comprehensive plan to implement a  rural
              regional K-8 teacher training program that was developed  under an NSF planning
              grant.  The project will combine the  resources of 14 rural school districts,
              four Indian Reservations,  Montana State University, professional scientists,
              local  businesses, parent groups and current NSF initiatives in the  state to
              establish self-sustaining science, and technology  programs.  The curriculum to
              be implemented will include NSF  funded EDC-Insights, FOSS and STC materials.  
               Over the life of the project, 518 participants will attend a  summer workshops
              where half of the time is devoted to hands-on  units.  Teachers will also learn
              how better to serve the Native  American population and how to interest females
              in mathematics  and science professions.  Additional workshops will be offered 
              throughout the school year and teachers are required to  participate in a
              minimum of two professional development  activities in the state or at
              universities.    Professional scientists will work side by side with the
              teachers  and act as role models during the workshops.  After the  workshops,
              teachers will be connected to a resource scientist and  to a learning circle,
              teachers of similiar interests, through  various methods of telecommunications
              such as Internet and 1-800  bulletin boards.  Such telecommunications will be
              utilized  extensively due to distance barriers in these rural areas.  The 
              scientists will also serve as advocates on local school boards  and community
              groups to support implementation of national reform  at the local level.   
              Cost sharing is 87% of the total NSF requested budget.  ***
