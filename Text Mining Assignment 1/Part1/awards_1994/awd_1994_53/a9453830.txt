Abstract    :
                                                ABSTRACT    ESI-9453830  Teodoro Halpern      
                 Building Bridges for Cooperation in Physics Education    Forty participants
              from the United States will attend the Fifth  Inter-American Conference on
              Physics Education. These participants  include 20 high school physics teachers
              and 20 physics faculty from  2- and 4-year undergraduate institutions.  The
              goal of the  conference is to build bridges for cooperation among physics 
              educators in the Americas and Caribbean and extend networks which  were
              established through previous Inter-American Conferences on  Physics Education.
              The particular emphasis of this conference will  better prepare teachers from
              the United States to teach students of  the "emerging majorities". The
              conference design includes  simultaneous translators at the conference and
              translation of the  conference's papers from the original language. The papers
              will be  grouped by grade level and published in booklet form for use by 
              elementary, high school and university teachers. The conference  will be held
              at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas on  July 17-22, 1994.
