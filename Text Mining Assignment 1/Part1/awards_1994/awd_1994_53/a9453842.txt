Abstract    :
              PMSA-9453842  Jefferson  County Public Schools  Louisville, KY  Podbelsek, Allen
                 "Partnership for Minority Student Achievement"    Jefferson County Public
              Schools, collaborating with a university,  community agencies, and local
              businesses, will implement a five  year Partnership for Minority Student
              Achievement program that will  address the critical problem of preparing more
              minority students to  enter college and pursue mathematics/science/engineering
              careers.   The project will directly impact 2,900 of the district's 30,000+ 
              minority students, their parents, and 390 teachers in 155 schools.   The
              project will replicate the concepts and activities of the  following successful
              models:  AVID (Advancement Vis individual  Determination), SECME (Science
              Engineering Communications and  Mathematics Enrichment), Kentucky K-4
              Mathematics Specialist  program, SUM (Success understanding Mathematics), and
              TEAMS  (Teaching Elementary  Assessments in Math and Science).  The  project
              will use staff development, classroom instruction, and  student activity
              components to 1) prepare teachers to develop new  teaching strategies, 2)
              involve students in hands-on mathematics  and science activities, 3) encourage
              parents to take part in their  child's education, 4) improve study skills, 5)
              stress the  importance of science and mathematics education, and 6) expose 
              minority students to minority role models in the professional  community.
