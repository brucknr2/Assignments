Abstract    :
              9453050  Bybee    The Ministry of Education in Israel and the National Science
              Foundation are supporting a two-part conference of one week each in each
              country.  Five Isreali and five U. S. science educators exchange information on
              the process of science reform in the two countries and the role of technology
              education in the school science programs.  The project is to initiate a long
              term working arrangement to share ideas and resources and development of
              curricula for science and technology education.  The conference would include
              visits to schools, universities and other institutions involved in educational
              reform.    ***
