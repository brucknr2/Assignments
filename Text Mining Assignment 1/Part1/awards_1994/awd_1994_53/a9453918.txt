Abstract    :
              9453918  Stevens    UCLA Medical School  Problem-Solving in Sciences: An
              Innovative Software Approach    This 48 month project introduces 240 first tier
              and 240 second  tier teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District to 
              advanced problem solving techniques and analysis using software  developed for
              medical schools to teach problem solving and  monitor student and class
              strategies and mastery.  The project  builds on existing software, IMMEX, and
              on the Science Education  Partnership the medical school has with the school
              district and  community.      First tier teachers receive 200 hours of
              instruction over four  weeks with follow up.  Teams of up to six teachers are
              selected  from secondary schools in the district.  Each first tier teacher 
              commits to approximately 10 hours to be used for inservicing  colleagues. 
              Consequently, each school has access to up to 60  hours of inservice
              instruction.    The Windows based software system used allows teachers to
              author  problem solving scenarios without needing to know programming.  
              Included are diagnostic tools, many samples, and some experience  with high
              school teachers.  IMMEX is intended to be used to  supplement real world
              experiences.    Cost sharing on the project was estimated at 28% for the first 
              year.  ***
