Abstract    :
              9453757  Krakauer    The Museum of Life and Science will use this planning grant
              to  bring together zoo, botanical garden, and science center  professionals to
              a) assess the feasibility of an "interactive zoo,"  b) identify animals species
              that exhibit behaviors in a zoo  environment that provide natural opportunities
              for related  interactive exhibits, and c) generate a White Paper reviewing 
              relevant exhibits in zoos and science centers and proposing design  criteria
              for the interactive exhibits.    The planning activities include: the
              development of a "White Paper"  that will include a review of key research
              findings in  developmental psychology and visitor behavior as they apply to 
              playgrounds, zoos, and interactive exhibit environments, an  overview of
              relevant exhibit techniques and technologies, and case  studies of existing
              exhibits; a 2-day meeting to discuss the  issues; and travel to exemplary
              museums, zoos, aquaria, and  botanical gardens.    These results will be used
              in the development of interactive  exhibits in an outdoor setting included in
              the museum's Master Plan  2000.  They have proposed the analogy of a field
              research station  in their approach to learning in an outdoor setting.  They
              envision  three thematic "field stations": "Down to Earth," "Watery Worlds," 
              and "Catch the Wind."  The specific exhibit plans will be finalized  after the
              completion of the planning grant.    Although the Museum of Life and Science
              will be the primary  beneficiary of this planning activity, the background
              information  gathered, the issues discussed, and the critical appraisals will
              be  relevant to other museums with and interested in developing  exhibits in an
              out-of-door setting.  The results will be broadly  disseminated by means of
              publications and presentations at  professional meetings.
