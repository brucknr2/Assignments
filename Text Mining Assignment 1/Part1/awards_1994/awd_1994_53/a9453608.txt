Abstract    :
              Ten  institutions which service the Los Angeles  Area  have  come  together  to 
              form  the  Los  Angeles Collaborative  for  Teacher  Excellence   (LACTE).   
              The   institutions   consist   of   five  universities/colleges  (California 
              State  University,  Dominguez  Hills; California State University, Los Angeles;
              California State  University,  Fullerton;  Loyola Marymount University; 
              Occidental  College) paired with their feeder community colleges (El  Camino; 
              East  Los  Angeles;  Fullerton; Santa Monica; Glendale  Community  Colleges).  
               In  Los  Angeles County there are 1.5 million K-12 students  (74%  are 
              members  of  minority groups) and 60,000 teachers  (30%  are  members  of 
              minority  groups).  The Collaborative  is  making  a  strong effort to prepare
              greater numbers of qualified mathematics  and  science  teachers  and  to
              recruit  a  greater  number  from  underrepresented groups.  It is also
              designed to  strengthen  the  mathematics  and  science backgrounds of  the 
              future  elementary  teacher.    In  the first year of the project a thorough
              recruitment campaign  will  be conducted to identify 100 prospective secondary
              teachers  and 100 pre-elementary teachers to become part of a network which 
              will  meet on a regular basis.  Also involved in the network will  be  science,
              mathematics, engineering and education faculty along  with master teachers. 
              Jointly the five institutions will prepare  and  conduct  professional
              development workshops for  mathematics  and  science  faculty.  These workshops
              will feature  innovative,  integrated mathematics and science courses, based on
              courses  currently  being  piloted across the nation.   The  Collaborative 
              will develop and revise ten courses for pre-service teachers  and  implement
              the courses in the ten institutions.    The goals of the Collaborative are:  1)
              To increase the number of  mathematics/science majors from underrepresented
              groups  who  are  planning  on teaching as a career.  2) Refine the present 
              course  of study at each  institution to reflect the necessary integration  of
              mathematics, science and technology in the pre-service content  preparation of
              undergraduate students. 3) Develop an experiential  component  for future
              elementary mathematics/science  specialists  and  secondary science and
              mathematics teachers. 4)  Establish  a  support network for the prospective
              teachers.
