Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the development of children's  interpretations of
              patterns and variability in data; and their  elaboration of key concepts
              involved in this process, uncertainty,  chance, and causality.  The data the
              children interpret are data  they themselves have collected in the context of
              investigations in  science.  this focus is strategic from a number of
              perspectives.   It accords with the NCTM's concerns to transform the practice
              of  mathematics education into a more concept-oriented and applied  domain. 
              More specifically, it fits with how the NCTM recommends  teachers begin
              informal study of statistics and probability in the  early grades: engaging
              children in data collection, data  representation, and data interpretation, in
              conjunction with their  exploration of concepts of chance.  This research
              agenda  simultaneously addresses a growing concern within this field of 
              science education that, as far as possible given developmental  constraints,
              children's science instruction should accord with the  nature of scientific
              inquiry.
