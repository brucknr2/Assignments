Abstract    :
              9453813  Philip M. Burgess  Using Science & Technology to Build High Performance
              Communities  The proposed activity is to undertake an experimental
              demonstration  program to enhance the concept and activities of EPSCoR in the
              West  by establishing and managing a network of resources from state and 
              federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation,  Department of
              Defense, Department of Energy, Environmental  Protection Agency, National
              Aeronautics & Space Administration, and  the U.S.Department of Agriculture. 
              These agencies currently  conduct EPSCoR or EPSCoR-like programs.  The program
              will convene  a series of workshops to promote and enhance EPSCoR in the West. 
               The Center will (1) identify western EPSCoR states that will  benefit from the
              use of locally available science and technology  resources; (2) identify
              western enterprise formation and long-term  job creation, (3) enhance EPSCoR
              relations with statewide and  regional civic leadership, (4) convene workshops
              to explore  resources and strategies, (5) develop university/industry 
              cooperative projects directed at economic development, and (6)  provide general
              administrative support activities necessary to  perform these functions.     
              The project provides for the assessment of western EPSCoR state  potential for
              technology development.  It will use its assessment  process to select those
              western EPSCoR states with the greatest  potential as pilot states in which to
              develop experimental  projects.  The projects will attempt to integrate
              university,  industry, and federal resources towards the goal of technology- 
              intensive economic development.  Assessment and documentation of  the various
              strategies used will be catalogued.
