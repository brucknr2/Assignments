Abstract    :
              9453748  Bendet    School-based SMART is an institutionalized model program
              designed  to encourage and educate elementary school-age girls to understand 
              that mathematics and science are important and  relevant to them.  SMART
              provides girls with active instructional  and motivational support in pursuing
              education and employment  opportunities in these fields.  It enhances the
              existent math  and science curricula by providing hands-on activities in a 
              single-sex environment that encourages girls to take risks and  learn by doing.
               Every 4th and 5th grade girl in selected  schools is involved in the program,
              thus eliminating the  self-selection factor inherent in other  after-school
              models.    School-based SMART proposes to give young female students positive 
              and empowering experiences with science and mathematics within the  school
              setting.  The SMART model and curriculum give girls the  confidence to assume
              positions of leadership in their  co-educational classes.  Additionally,
              heightened administrative  awareness of gender equity issues, in relation to
              science and  mathematics, will be achieved as a result of the integration of
              the  SMART model.  Teacher in-service training and family education are 
              significant components included in the project's design.  The  project includes
              an outside evaluation and plans for national  dissemination through Girls
              Incorporated affiliates.  ***
