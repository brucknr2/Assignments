Abstract    :
              9453926  Kirwan    Operation Primary Physical Science (OPPS) will enhance
              primary  grade teachers' understanding of the basic physical science  concepts
              which are first introduced in the primary grades. Using  the  NSF-funded
              Operation Physics (OP) model a four week-long  series of
              constructivist-oriented workshops will be developed and  validated for primary
              grade teachers. OPPS themes and topics for  these workshops will be determined
              through review of: state science  curriculum frameworks, recommendations from
              Project 2061 and  examination of several commercial elementary science
              curricula.  Each of the 20 individual workshops will require a full 8-hour day 
              to cover adequately, with each series constituting the equivalent  of one full
              week of instruction. Although each workshops and each  workshop series will be
              able to stand alone, a spiral approach will  underpin the structure of the
              program as major physical science  concepts are periodically revisited in
              varying contexts and depths.  OPPS workshops will use only everyday inexpensive
              materials in  activities reviewed for safety. Workshop activities will be
              adapted  from extant materials. OPPS workshops will be developed and field 
              tested by a group of 13-science educators. They will also develop  a Workshop
              Leaders Guide as was done in OP. Each of these  individuals will be responsible
              for arranging to conduct 10-field  test workshops during the development
              period.    Using these teacher enhancement materials thirty-six, 
              geographically distributed, 3-member leadership teams, each  associated with a
              host college/university, will be selected and  trained in the use of these
              materials and in workshop delivery.  Teams will attend a 16-day program in each
              of two consecutive  summers at the University of Maryland's Science Education
              Center.  Two training programs will be held each summer, with 18 teams in  each
              session.  Following the first year's training teams will be  expected to
              initiate local OPPS programs providing at least 20  grade K-5  teachers with
              40-hours of OPPS workshops. During the  second and third year teams will
              provide 20 grade K-5 teachers with  a minimum of 120 hours of OPPS workshops.
              Graduate or continuing  education credit is expected to be available to
              participants in  these team-led workshops.
