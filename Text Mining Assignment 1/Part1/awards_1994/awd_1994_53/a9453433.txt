Abstract    :
              9353433  Todd  The objective of this research is to develop a new method for 
              determination and visualization of the concentration and flow of  gases and
              vapors in air.  The method is based on coupling the  chemical detection
              technology of optical remote sensing with the  mapping capabilities of computed
              tomography.  Chemical  concentrations determined by using a network of infrared
              beams  projected through air at many angles are coupled with real-time 
              measurements obtained through use of an optical remote sensing  system to
              obtain path-integrated concentrations of chemicals over  the entire path of the
              beam.  The initial phases of this research  involve modification and evaluation
              of tomographic reconstruction  algorithms and image processing techniques for
              reconstructing  chemical concentrations in air.  Application-specific measures 
              developed to evaluate algorithm performance and image quality  will be followed
              by simulation studies to determine conditions  for laboratory validation of the
              method.    Results of this research are expected to be applied to 
              identification and characterization of the motion and dispersion  of air
              pollutants after their emission from sources.  This is the  initial increment
              of an award to provide support for this  Presidential Faculty Fellow who was
              selected through evaluation  procedures conducted by the National Science
              Foundation and based  on criteria contained in NSF 93-114 which contains the
              nomination  guidelines.  ***
