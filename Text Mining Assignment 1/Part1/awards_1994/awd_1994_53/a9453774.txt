Abstract    :
              9453774  Coyne    The Great Lakes Museum of Science, Environment, and Technology
              will  develop a 10,000 sq. ft. exhibit focusing on The Great Lakes 
              Environment.  Addressing the core mission of the museum, the  exhibit will
              promote understanding about "the interdependence of  scientific, environmental,
              and technological activities in the  Great Lakes Region."  The exhibit will
              focus on the Great Lakes as  an ecosystem.  By means of interactive activities,
              visitors will  learn how this ecosystem was formed, the web of life it
              supports,  the stresses it receives, and the efforts to restore its health.   
              The Great Lakes Museum is a new 165,000 sq. ft. facility located in  downtown
              Cleveland on the Lake Erie Shore and is scheduled to open  in 1996.  The
              exhibit area will cover 50,000 sq. ft. and will be  fully accessible.  An
              entire floor will be dedicated to the Great  Lakes Environment.  Complementary
              educational programs will consist  of the following: take home activity guides
              to encourage the  discovery and exploration of ecosystems in backyards or 
              neighborhoods, pre and post visit activities for school groups, and  teacher
              enhancement activities.  Museum staff are participating in  the planning
              process for the Urban Systemic Initiative of Cleveland  and activiites and
              content of exhibits will be developed to  complement the curriculum.  The
              museum will develop a menu of  activities and databases for electronic
              networking with homes and  schools.  They will have video conferencing
              capabilities to connect  the museum with classrooms.
