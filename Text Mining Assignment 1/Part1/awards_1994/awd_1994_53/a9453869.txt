Abstract    :
              PMSA-9453869  Denver Public Schools  Denver, CO  Stein, Fredrick, Leroy Lopez,
              John Rael, Elizabeth Biggs and   Rod Cornish    "Minority Initiative for Denver
              Schools (MINDS)"    The Denver Public Schools, in partnership with Colorado
              State  University, and CMEA/MESA (Colorado Minority Engineering 
              Association/Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement), proposes  a five-year
              program of academic-year and summer enrichment  activities which will improve
              minority student achievement in  grades 7-12 in the Denver Public Schools.  The
              overall goal of the  Minority Initiative for Denver Schools (MINDS) is to
              significantly  increase the number of Denver minority underrepresented students
               who enter science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) careers.  The  goals of
              this project will be achieved through a four-component  strategy consisting of:
               (1) recruitment of minority students into  the MINDS program beginning in the
              seventh grade and continuing  through high school graduation; (2) the retention
              of students in  the MINDS program through newly-designed academic-year and
              summer  courses based on the Small-Scale approach in science and the 
              Interactive approach in mathematics which show shy SEM is useful to  them as
              individuals; (3) the expansion of existing district-wide,  school-site
              MESA/DEEP activities consisting of motivational,  project-centered, thematic,
              hands-on and mentoring activities  (MINDS will prepare increasing numbers of
              minority students for the  MESA/DEEP program); and (4) a concurrent staff
              development program  to create MINDS science and mathematics teacher-leaders to
              deliver  the above courses and activities and to explore the unexplored  roles
              of minorities in science, engineering and mathematics.
