Abstract    :
              9453014  Holmes    The New Orleans Public Schools Urban Systemic Initiative
              proposes  a major and profound change in the entire K-12 science,  mathematics,
              and technology program.  Five themes serve as the  foundation for the plan of
              action.  The themes are: (1)Student  Achievement; Assessment; (2)Pedagogy and
              Teaching Practices;  (3)Schools and District Culture; (4)Policy and Governance;
              and  (5)Partnerships and coordination with External Agencies and  Stakeholders.
               These themes will generate specific changes that  will affect students,
              parents, teachers, and other staff member in  the system.  The major changes
              are as follows:integrated hands-on  science, mathematics,and technology for all
              students; learning  experiences that connect all content areas through the use
              of  spiral, interdisciplinary, multicultural, standards-based thematics  units;
              a computer in every classroom in every school; a mentoring  and internship
              opportunity for every student; algebra by eighth  grade for every student; a
              comprehensive professional development  program for classroom
              teachers,counselors, principals, others  administrators, and staff; a team
              approach to manage the district;  realignment of policies and resources to
              support mathematics,  science, and technology; and expansion of the consortia
              of  stakeholders.  These reforms will be phased in five years of the  plan.  At
              this point all schools will be in  the program, leaving  two years of funding
              for the opportunity to make refinements and  improvements.
