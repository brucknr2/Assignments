Abstract    :
              Committed to ensuring the provision of high quality  mathematics and science
              education to all students in this  majority-Hispanic community, the El Paso
              Partnership for  Excellence in Teacher Preparation represents a major 
              deviation from the historic paradigm of teacher education.  The Partnership is
              an integral part of the El Paso  Collaborative for Academic Excellence and the
              El Paso Urban  Systemic Initiative and joins the Colleges of Science and 
              Education at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), the  El Paso Community
              College, and three major public school  districts in El Paso County in a
              fundamental transformation  of teacher preparation that is grounded in and
              contributes  to systemic reform in K-12 education.    The Partnership, which
              will be led by Arturo Pacheco, Dean  of UTEP's College of Education, and John
              R. Bristol, Interim  Dean of the College of Science, will sponsor activities 
              contributing to four major goals:  (1) to recruit more  students into
              mathematics and science teacher preparation,  particularly more minority
              students, and provide support and  financial incentives for those planning to
              become teachers;  (2) revise and enhance curriculum at both the lower- and 
              upper-division levels so that prospective teacher achieve  high levels of both
              content knowledge and pedagogical  skills; (3) to enhance the teaching skills
              of mathematics,  science, and teacher education faculty so that they can both 
              better impart content knowledge and model exemplary  pedagogical behaviors; and
              (4) to provide support for new  mathematics and science teachers as they enter
              their  profession.
