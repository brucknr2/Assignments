Abstract    :
              9453944  O'Leary,     The Nebraska Science Enhancement Project    This 48 month
              project offers a four-year series of interactive  satellite TV sessions on the
              subject of water.  The Satellite  Educational and Environmental Research
              program already exists and  is one of the ways used in a similar project on
              radon to reach  the large number of teachers in remote areas of the state.   
              The goal of the project is to reach 100 teachers and 10,000  students in each
              year of the program.  The water project is  organized around statewide
              experiments in which teachers and  their students make environmental
              measurements of water quality  and quantity in their communities.  This data
              extends the  Nebraska resource base for water policy decisions.  Community 
              involvement includes presentations by school groups and community 
              participation in water measurement.    The Regional Coalitions of the SSI
              assists with recruitment,  management of the downlink sites, and dissemination
              of resources.   This project is an expansion of a pilot conducted during
              1993-94.    Cost sharing is estimated at 48%.  ***
