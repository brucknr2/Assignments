Abstract    :
              9453938  Schatz    Three rural school districts Riverview, Skykomish and
              Snoqualmie  Valley in conjunction with the Pacific Science Center will 
              cooperatively change how science is taught at the elementary level  in the
              schools.  The project will prepare each district to develop  a new vision for
              elementary science curriculum establish mechanisms  to implement and sustain
              the vision provide staff development to  all elementary teachers as a beginning
              to implement the vision.    Through extensive staff development 30 teachers,
              called STAFF  leaders, together with 10 administrators will become leaders in 
              their districts.  These STAFF leaders with the involvement of the  entire
              teaching staff and the community, utilizing the best in  quality science
              education will develop comprehensive K-5 curricula  that reflects current
              research and national standards.  The leaders  will provide 40 hours of science
              education staff development to  each district's entire elementary teaching
              staff, a total of 193  teachers.  This 40 hours provides just the beginning, as
              districts  have committed to developing ongoing support for both staff 
              development and materials management.  The goal is to provide all  teachers
              with a minimum 153 hours of professional development.   Principals and
              administrators will receive 121 hours and parents 32  hours.    The request is
              for $669,100 of NSF support with cost share  estimated at $1,004,576.
