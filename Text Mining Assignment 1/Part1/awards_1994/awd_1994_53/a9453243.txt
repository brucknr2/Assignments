Abstract    :
              9453243  Kenkel      This planning grant is enabling a working group of
              chemistry  educators from community colleges, high schools, and a university, 
              along with laboratory technicians and supervisors from industry and 
              government, to develop a comprehensive plan for creating and  operating a
              National Center of Excellence for Chemistry-Based  Technician Education
              ("NCE").  The center, which will be based at  the Southeast Community College
              in Lincoln Nebraska, will serve as  a national model for program and materials
              development, and will  serve as a clearinghouse for information critical to 
              chemistry-based technician education.  The working group for the  proposed NCE
              builds on the broad experience and national leadership  of its members and is
              comprehensively considering issues related to  the Center's development,
              including:  curriculum reform and  implementation, alliances with industry,
              direct transfer of credit  to four-year institutions, and "2+2+2" articulation.
               During the planning period, the working group will be developing  the
              structural and programmatic basis to create a National Center  of Excellence at
              Southeast Community College which can take the  national lead in the
              development of a dynamic and cooperative  approach to chemistry-based
              technician education.  ***
