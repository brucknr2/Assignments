Abstract    :
              9453874  Fey    The International Commission on Mathematics Instruction (ICMI)
              will  hold an invitational international working conference in College  Park,
              MD from 8-11 May 1994.  The purpose of the conference is to  allow prominent
              researchers in mathematics curricula, teaching, and  learning.  Results will be
              disseminated to the broader research  community in the United States and around
              the world and to  concerned mathematicians, teachers, teacher educators, and 
              curriculum developers.  The NSF grant will be used to support  travel and
              subsistence of participants, to enable the conference to  engage the best
              researchers from around the world.  ***
