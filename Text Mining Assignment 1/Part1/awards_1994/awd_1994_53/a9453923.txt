Abstract    :
              9453923  Stafford    The Wisconsin Staff Development Initiative (WSDI) is a
              5-year  project to effect comprehensive S/M/T reform through a program of 
              systematic, coordinated and continuous staff development  activities.  Each
              year Lead Teacher Institutes (LTI) will prepare  60 teachers in grades K-12 to
              be change agents in their schools and  to staff the Summer Academy, modeled
              after the CRAY Academy, at six  sites around the state of Wisconsin.  Several
              teams from nearest  neighbor states will pilot dissemination beyond Wisconsin
              in a  phased approach to national implementation.  The LTIs consist of  two
              4-week sessions in each of two consecutive summers.  Teacher  Enhancement
              activities include:  Participation in 2-weeks of the  CRAY Academy, one week
              preparing to lead a Summer Academy and two  weeks of teaching in a Summer
              Academy with the aid of a mentor.    In the Summer Academy teachers pick a
              single topic, from 40 or more  S/M/T topics for each week of participation. 
              Topics include  Operation Physics topics, Graphing Calculators, Fast Plants,
              etc.   Over a three or four year period teachers participate in 3-4 such 
              sessions.  Participation in these Summer Academies usually includes  school
              teams as well as principals.  Each academy has a core series  of workshops plus
              others which reflect local needs.  Teachers earn  one-graduate credit for each
              Summer Academy they complete.    The LTIs are held in Chippewa Falls, WI the
              original CRAY Academy  site.  New sites will be phased in as follows:  Madison,
              LaCrosse,  Fennimore, Green Bay in 1994, Milwaukee in 1995, Racine & Hayward 
              in 1996, Rhinelander in 1997, Beloit and Stevens Point in 1998 and  Fond du Lac
              in 1999.  The project will use the existing educational  infrastructure to
              deliver services to teachers and effect  comprehensive change in local
              districts.
