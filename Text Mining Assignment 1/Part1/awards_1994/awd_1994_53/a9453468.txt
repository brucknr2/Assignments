Abstract    :
              Abstract  Winoto  My research goal is to understand the molecular and cellular 
              machinery of how and why cells die.  We are using biochemical,  genetic,
              molecular biological and immunological techniques to study  the differences of
              the molecular processes between life and death  of a cell during development. 
              My teaching plan is to establish a  vigorous interdisciplinary Molecular
              Biology and Immunology program  at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  ***
