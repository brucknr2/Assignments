Abstract    :
              9453048  Semper      ABSTRACT:  The Exploratorium is developing the pilot for a
              Saturday morning science-oriented, live-action, film and animation, national
              network television series for teens aged 13 to 17.  The half-hour show will
              present everyday science and the process of problem solving in a fast-paced,
              hip, and challenge-oriented format.  Two teams, each of three teenagers, will
              compete in a series of challenges which require the application of common sense
              knowledge, observation, experimentation, and problem-solving strategies useful
              in science.  The object is to demonstrate that real-world problem solving makes
              use of many skills and may have more than one solution.     The Exploratorium
              will administer the project and will be responsible for the science content. 
              Production will be done by Colossal Pictures, a San Francisco production studio
              experienced in animation and youth-oriented programming.
