Abstract    :
              94-53362  Broholm  This  Presidential  Faculty Fellow award will support  a 
              project  involving neutron diffraction investigations of quantum phenomena  in
              condensed matter systems. The project has a strong educational  component which
              involves both undergraduate and graduate students  in  the  research. The
              research addresses structural and magnetic  order in so-called quantum
              disordered solids that only exhibit  a  magnetic  phase transition in the limit
              of zero temperature.  The  systems  include  one-dimensional linear chains, 
              two-dimensional  antiferromagnetic  sheets, heavy-Fermion metals  and 
              transition-  metal   oxides.  The  research  is  of  considerable  fundamental 
              interest, but has potential technological importance since it may  shed   light
                on   related  fields  such  as  high   temperature  superconductivity.   
              This Presidential Faculty Fellow award will support a project  to  study 
              magnetism  and electrical properties  of  materials  which  exhibit  quantum 
              effects. The project has a  strong  educational  component which involves both
              undergraduate and graduate students  in  the  research. The research seeks to
              study phase  transitions  that only emerge as the materials reach "absolute
              zero". This can  be  contrasted  with  non-quantum  materials  such  as  ice 
              that  undergoes  an  ordinary phase transition, melting  a  32  F.  The 
              systems  include  linear  chains  or  two-dimensional  arrays  of  magnetic
              atoms, complex metal alloys and transition-metal oxides.  The  research  is of
              considerable fundamental interest,  but  has  potential  technological
              importance since it may  shed  light  on  related fields such as high
              temperature superconductivity.
