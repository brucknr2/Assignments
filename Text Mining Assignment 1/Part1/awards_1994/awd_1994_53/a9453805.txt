Abstract    :
              9453805  Yao    The Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum is requesting $370,728 to create a
               traveling exhibit entitled "How Things Work, which will familiarize  students
              and the general public with the science and engineering  behind 15-20 "gadgets"
              which play vital roles in their everyday  lives.  A number of the exhibit
              elements will be based on the work  of Dr. Richard Crane.  Ancillary materials
              will be developed for  classroom teachers as part of school outreach.  An
              Exhibition  Resource Guide will be developed for use by other museum venues, as
               well as teachers, students and others.
