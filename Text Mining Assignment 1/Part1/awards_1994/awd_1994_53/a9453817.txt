Abstract    :
              9453817     Anderson    The Vermont Center for the Book in collaboration with
              the Vermont  Council on the Humanities, Montshire Museum, and other Vermont 
              science activity centers propose to develop a national model of a  four-part
              book discussion/science activity program of early science  literacy for parents
              of preschool children.  Parents will be  trained to gain confidence in their
              ability to do science activity  kit to keep.  The project expects to reach 1200
              parents and 240  professionals during this three year project.
