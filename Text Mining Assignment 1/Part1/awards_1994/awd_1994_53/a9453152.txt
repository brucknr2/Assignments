Abstract    :
              9453152  Willis    This Local Systemic Change project will target the entire 
              population of K-8 teachers in 44 schools in the New  Jersey districts of East
              Orange and Jersey City.  Through a program  of summer institutes, an
              experimental Living Laboratory for  practice teaching and peer mentoring,
              school year outreach  activities and teacher run in service workshops, the
              enhancement  program will: expand teacher knowledge of subject matter, increase
               understanding of inquiry-based and process-oriented techniques,  promote the
              integration of SMT with other portions of the  curriculum, increase teacher
              confidence in teaching and develop  teacher leaders to institutionalize the
              program beyond the grant  period.  The first cohort of 120 teachers will
              receive 120 hours of  staff development in the first year.  30 teachers from
              the first  year will return a second year to become teacher leaders.  The goal 
              is to reach 540 to 570 teachers directly over the five years (the  exact number
              will depend on repeats)  The rest of the K-8 teachers  will be reached by the
              Consortia staff and Outreach teams working  in close cooperation with school
              teams, to bring regular inservice  activities into all the schools in both
              districts, for at least 100  hours over the five years of the project.  The
              curriculum in the  schools will be selected from nationally validated
              instructional  programs, in particular Science and Technology for Children. 
              The request is for $2,855,398 with cost share estimated at  $1,046,585 (37%).
