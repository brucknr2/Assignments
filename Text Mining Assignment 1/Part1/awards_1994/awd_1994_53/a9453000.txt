Abstract    :
              9453000  Marks    The Health Museum (THM) is requesting $868,108 over 30 months
              to  create a 3,600 sq. ft. permanent exhibit containing seven Body  Stops
              components, which will maintain THM's science literacy focus  by linking
              concepts of human biology to everyday experience through  visitor exploration
              of the human body's seen and unseen operating  systems.  Ancillary
              instructional materials and programs will be  produced.    The educational
              goals of the project are to:       1. Promote understanding of the basic
              biological sciences in       the context of the human life cycle and health;   
                 2. Present vital basic science information through an active       and
              accessible exhibit environment which complements formal       science
              education;       3. Develop an appreciation of basic human biological sciences 
                   as they are presented similarly across all people and an      
              appreciation of human variability as these biological       processes are
              played out in the individual.    The target audiences are families, urban
              youth, and student and  teacher groups.
