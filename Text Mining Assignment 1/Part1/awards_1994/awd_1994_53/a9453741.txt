Abstract    :
              9453741  Teasdale    To change the perceptions that young women have about
              themselves, as well as about the fields  of engineering as career options, a
              two-week summer engineering experience for young men and  women will be offered
              by the University of Idaho College of Engineering.  The workshop will 
              incorporate strategies to improve:  the instructional climate provided by the
              faculty; the  understanding of gender and cultural diversity issues by
              students, faculty, and counselors; and  the self-esteem of the young women. 
              The new strategies and approaches will be incorporated  into an ongoing summer
              experience for high school students which has been offered for a  number of
              years, but which previously had not been successful in attracting young women. 
                This project will offer the first opportunity for a university experience for
              most of the students.   They will register for a two-credit pre-engineering
              course, live on the University campus, attend  courses and work in laboratories
              in University buildings, as well as use other University  facilities.  The
              college atmosphere will provide a transitional experience for the students
              which  will be valuable when they attend college after high school graduation. 
              It is anticipated that not  only will the young women develop more positive
              perceptions about their abilities in math,  science, and engineering, and
              change perceptions about engineering as a career option, but that  the young
              men will have a better understand of diversity issues and profit from the
              enhanced  learning environment.  ***
