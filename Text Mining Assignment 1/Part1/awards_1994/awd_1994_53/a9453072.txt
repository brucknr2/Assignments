Abstract    :
              9453072  Keller  The project is a dissemination/communication activity related
              to  written, electronic, and human resources that promote science  education
              for students with disabilities.  The project is  designed to provide the more
              than 20 thousand K-12 science  teachers and administrators attending the 1995
              annual conference  of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) with 
              information that promote inclusion of students with disabilities  in precollege
              science education.  The dissemination activities  are to be conducted at the
              Convention Exhibition Area during the  1995 NSTA Conference in Philadelphia. 
              Project participants have  extensive experience and expertise in science
              education for  students with disabilities.  Members of the Science Association 
              for Persons with Disabilities (SAPD) will assist in staffing the  exhibit. 
              (Many of these experts have disabilities.)  Project  participants will
              accumulate and reproduce materials for  distribution at the meeting.  Other
              materials will be exhibited  and requests for copies will be taken and
              subsequently mailed.   Records of the materials disseminated and other
              activities  including on-site interactions during the five days of the  exhibit
              will be maintained and reported.  The project should  result in heightened
              awareness of K-12 science teachers to the  abilities of students with
              disabilities to perform successfully  in precollege science, and knowledge
              regarding the availability  of resources should result in increased inclusion
              of these  students in science education.***
