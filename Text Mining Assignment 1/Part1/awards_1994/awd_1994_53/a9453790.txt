Abstract    :
              9453790  Eichinger    The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry is requesting
              $971,288  over three years for the development, formative and summative 
              evaluation of two traveling exhibits.  The 5,000 sq. ft. traveling  exhibit is
              designed for children ages 3-8 and their families, using  the context, setting,
              characters and challenged portrayed in the  books of Richard Scarry, a noted
              children's author.  A 2,000 sq.  ft. mini-version traveling exhibit will be
              produced for use in  smaller venues.  Parent, teacher, and staff guides will be
              prepared  and distributed.  This exhibit gives strong emphasis to  facilitating
              parent interaction with their children, and has  activity areas for parents
              built into the exhibit.  There is also  an emphasis on anti-bias content within
              the exhibit.
