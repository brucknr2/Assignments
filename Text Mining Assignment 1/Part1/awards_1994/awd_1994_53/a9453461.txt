Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis and study of epoxy  ketones. 
              Specifically, the synthesis of the natural product  manumycin will be carried
              out and the mechanism of action of  the compound will be studied.  Research
              experience is used as a  focal point for the teaching of both undergraduate and
              graduate  students.    Dr. Peter Wipf is being funded by the Synthetic Organic
              Program  as a Presidential Faculty Fellow.  He will focus his research  efforts
              on the design of new sunthetic methodology and its  application to natural
              products chemistry.  Dr. Wipf will be  involved in the teaching of both
              undergraduate and graduate  students.
