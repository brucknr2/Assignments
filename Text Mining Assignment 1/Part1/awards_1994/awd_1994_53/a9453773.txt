Abstract    :
              Apsell  9453773  ABSTRACT    This is a comprehensive project about the science
              behind special effects in the motion pictures.  WGBH, in association with
              eighteen museums in the Museum Film Network, will produce a 35 minute
              IMAX/OMNIMAX film showing the behind-the-scenes story of a group of filmmakers
              at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) as they create a special effects sequence
              in the IMAX/OMNIMAX format.  The film will illustrate how the eye and brain
              work together to process cinematic illusions.  The California Museum of Science
              and Industry (CMSI) will create a 6,000 sq. ft. traveling exhibit that will
              focus on the science and technical processes of special effect.  The exhibit
              will travel to fifteen other museums.  A smaller scale lobby exhibit also will
              be developed for display in the cueing areas of IMAX/OMNIMAX theaters that are
              showing the "Special Effects" film.  A collaborative educational outreach
              program will extend the reach of both the film and exhibit.      The project
              will be managed by the NOVA production unit at WGBH under the direction of
              Paula Apsell.  Ms. Apsell also will serve as Executive Producer for the
              IMAX/OMNIMAX film.  Diane Perlov, Curator of Exhibitions at CMSI, will
              supervise the exhibit portion of the project.  Kenneth Phillips, Curator of
              Aerospace Science at CMSI, will develop video interactives and oversee
              scientific content of the exhibit.  Carol Valenta, Director of Education for
              CMSI, and Beth Kirsh, Director of Educational Print and Outreach for WGBH, will
              be responsible for implementing the outreach plan.  Advisors for the project
              include David H. Hubel, neurobiologist, Harvard Medical School; Vilayanur S.
              Ramachandran, neurophysiologist, University of California, San Diego; Richard
              Gregory, perception psychologist, University of Bristol; Sally Duensing,
              Science and Museum Liaison, Exploratorium; Elizabeth Stage, Co-Director for
              Science, New Standards Project, National Center on Education and the Economy;
              and Robert Coutts, high school physics teacher, Los  Angeles, CA.
