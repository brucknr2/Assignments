Abstract    :
              9453958  Walter    In this Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement 
              Project, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF),  proposes a
              project in partnership with the San Francisco Unified  School District (SFUSD),
              whose purpose is to enable all of the  city's elementary schools to accomplish
              effective, site-based  science education reform.  UCSF's City Science program
              will  provide an intensive hands-on science program for 400 SFUSD  teachers who
              have taught less than seven years and a less  intensive program for 600 more
              experienced teachers in order to  broaden the base of teachers with hands-on
              science in a  cooperative learning environment.  It will also provide new 
              opportunities for a subset of the 100 teachers who are current  City Science
              participants to expand their capacity as science  teachers while serving to
              further develop in their role as  leaders.  They will support specific aspects
              of the district-wide  science education reform and mentor new leadership that
              will  sustain the reform process in their schools.  ***
