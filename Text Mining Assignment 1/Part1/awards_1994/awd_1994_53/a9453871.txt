Abstract    :
              9453871  Fox    We propose a two-tier project including:  a)an assessment task, 
              aimed at evaluating potential of VR in education and identifying  the
              associated R&D issues, b)a planning task, aimed at developing  the proposal for
              the follow-on R&D project at NPAC.  The assessment  task will be conducted from
              the perspective of the global scale  program towards educational VR.  The
              planning task will identify a  set of pilot modules to be developed at NPAC,
              tested in local  schools, and included into the global infrastructure developed
              by  several sites.  Within the assessment task, we expect to interact  within
              the NSF guided electronic forum with other sites developing  components of
              information infrastructure.  This will allow to both  establish unified global
              strategy and to identify the most  appropriate focused modules to be prototyped
              at NPAC.  ***
