Abstract    :
              9453959  Bower    To enable elementary school teachers to teach and assess
              hands-on,  inquiry-based science instruction effectively, this project will 
              create and pilot-test 4 Modules designed to improve and broaden  teacher
              science content knowledge.  The proposed modules, to be  developed and piloted
              by teams of teachers from Pasadena,  California and scientists from Caltech,
              will be field tested by  school system partnerships in Buffalo, New York,
              Cleveland, Ohio,  Highline, Washington, and Huntsville, Alabama.  The modules
              will  have several distinct characteristics.  First, each will be based  on a
              science content common to most kit-based curricula.  Second,  each module will
              be developed by a collaboration of experienced  teachers and scientists. 
              Third, the modules will be designed to  be used by teacher-scientist teams
              leading groups of other  teachers in an inquiry-based learning community like
              that of an  exemplary classroom.  Materials will initially be published with 
              desktop publishing and then disseminated via existing national  networks of
              school systems engaged in supporting inquiry science  instruction at the
              elementary school level.    The cost sharing will be 10% of the NSF funds.  ***
