Abstract    :
              9453898  Barrera    This proposal for the SACNAS annual conference will be held
              on  March 24-27, 1994 in Chicago, IL.  The objective of the conference  is to
              stimulate the interest of underrepresented minority high  school students,
              undergraduate students, graduate students, post-  doctoral fellows seeking
              science and engineering careers; and to  attract faculty, research scientists
              and university and government  representatives interested in sharing their
              experiences and eager  to learn and demonstrate how one can succeed in a
              science and  engineering career.    The conference will conduct symposia on
              recent Native American and  Hispanic advances and accomplishments in Science,
              Engineering, and  Mathematics fields.  The conference will also have a series
              of  workshops and information on career opportunities in the science  and
              engineering fields.  In addition, graduate students will  conduct oral research
              presentations and undergraduate students will  conduct poster presentations. 
              The conference will provide a forum  where peers and potential mentors or role
              models can meet, network,  advise and encourage students to be competitive and
              fulfill  research careers.  This conference will conduct a special workshop  on
              developing grant writing skills and science careers outside the  laboratory.
