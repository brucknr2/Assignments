Abstract    :
              9453888  Moshell    This proposal would support the gathering of data and
              production of  a report which recommends a research agenda concerning the 
              application of Virtual Environments (VE) to science and mathematics  education.
               The principal means to be used to gather this data are    1)   Correspondence
              with research leaders at various universities  around the country, and
              participation in several Internet news  groups to locate additional
              researchers;    2)   Visits to six to eight of the principal sites around the 
              country in which research on education and virtual environments is  underway;  
               3)   Travel to the United Kingdom (from France, during another  trip) to visit
              schools and universities developing research  programs in VE for education;   
              4)   Attendance of the National Educational Computing Convention in  Boston, MA
              for interviews and data gathering.    The resulting report will be provided to
              the National Science  Foundation in draft form on 15 May 1994, and in final
              form before  the end of June 1994.
