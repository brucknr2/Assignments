              Commitment:  $50,000                                ABSTRACT                   
                                   The Self Reliance Foundation is requesting a $50,000 grant
               to plan a nationally broadcast Spanish language outreach program  for science
              and environmental education in cooperation with the  Hispanic Radio Network
              (HRN).  HRN currently produce and  distribute two Spanish language radio
              programs.  Their plan is to  incorporate into these programs information about
              ways parents  and other adults can help children improve their math and science
               skills; about educational resources, scholarships, and career  opportunities
              in the sciences; about the importance of science in  everyday lives; and other
              information on current topics in  science and the environment.  Special
              attention will be paid to  information relevant to Hispanic migrant workers.   
                        The PI for the planning grant will be Jeff Kline, General  Manager of
              HRN.  Key HRN staff to be involved in the planning  include Consuelo Luz,
              producer of "Buscando la Belleze," and  Enrique Gil, co-producer of "Salvemos
              Nuestro Planeta.  Vincente  Llamas, Principal Investigator for the
              Comprehensive Regional  Center for Minorities in Las Vegas will be a principal 
              consultant.
