Abstract    :
              9453666  Richardson  The Baltimore Urban Systemic Initiative (BUSI) has as its 
              core a vision that seeks to provide the mathematics and  science fundamentals
              which will permit all students to  participate fully in a technological society
              and enable a  significantly greater number of Baltimore students to pursue 
              careers in mathematics, science, engineering, and  technology.  The BUSI
              features five major components: (1) a  new standards-based, K-12 science,
              mathematics and  technology (SMT) curriculum which includes increased science 
              and mathematics content and hands on, student-centered  pedagogy; (2) extensive
              professional development for  teachers to support the new curriculum; (3) a
              variety of  academic enrichment and support services offered directly to 
              students and teachers; (4) policy changes that "enable"  systemic change; and
              (5) the use of the "Efficacy Model" to  alter the belief systems of students
              and school personnel as  to the ability of all students to perform at a high
              level  and succeed in obtaining a quality SMT education.  The  Initiative will
              be implemented in partnership with Morgan  State University (MSU). 
              Professional development for  teachers will be offered through MSU and other
              local  universities and informal science organizations.  MSU's  successful
              Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities will  be an integral component of
              the BUSI plan, with particular  responsibility for providing student enrichment
              activities.
