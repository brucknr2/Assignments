Abstract    :
              9453095  Demee-Benoit    The San Francisco Zoological Society will use this
              planning grant  to involve representatives of their audience in the development
              of  the learning experiences that will be encorporated into their new  exhibit
              program "ZooWEB: Worldwide Education for Biodiversity."   They will bring
              together an Advisory Panel made up of  representatives of a broad spectrum of
              potential and current zoo  visitors (traditionally underserved groups, formal
              education  specialists, people with special needs, family groups, scientists) 
              and science educators to meet with the zoo's Planning Team who are  developing
              the master interpretive plan called ZOO Web.  ZooWEB  will adapt ecological
              themes and topics from the section of Systems  and Interactions in the
              California State Science Framework for  Public Schools.  The planning activity
              is a modification of a  business model designed to understand and meet customer
              needs by  constant improvement of product and service quality pioneered by W. 
              Edwards Deming.  This is a considerable departure from the  traditional manner
              in which zoo interpretation is developed.  Thus,  the Zoo will implement a new
              approach to exhibit development, one  that begins with focusing on visitors'
              interests in science, their  needs, learning styles, perceptions of zoos, etc. 
              Data will be  gathered by a number of techniques including focus groups, 
              interviews, and surveys.  Results of the planning activity will be  broadly
              disseminated.
