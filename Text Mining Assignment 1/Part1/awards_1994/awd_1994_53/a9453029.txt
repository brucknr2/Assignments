Abstract    :
              9453029  Duensing    The Exploratorium will develop an exhibit "Memory: A
              Biological  Cognitive and Cultural Exploration" along with various 
              complementary components.  The primary objective of this project is  to
              increase the public's awareness of the extent, importance, and  nature of their
              everyday rememberings.  Exploratorium staff will  use an approach to memory,
              and cognition in general, that considers  culture and cultural differences as
              essential to people's thinking  and behavior.    The exhibit area will be about
              2000 sq ft in size and will consist  of ten to twelve new activities and six
              revised interactive,  interdisciplinary exhibits.  Here visitors will have the 
              opportunity to interact with the exhibits, researchers, scientists,  artists,
              and other visitors, to explore the nature of memory and  its effect on their
              lives.  The exhibits will give visitors direct,  experiential insight into the
              workings of their memories.  Other  major components of the project include
              multimedia presentations,  printed materials, demonstrations, film programs and
              a symposium.   A publication Memory and Perception will be a supplemental guide
               that can be used by teachers and students at the secondary level.   It will
              address appropriate themes in the Science Framework for  California Public
              Schools.  Museum professionals, researchers,  teachers, and evaluators will be
              invited to participate in a one-  week symposium on Cognition in Science
              Centers.  The purpose of the  symposium is to develop a conceptual and
              practical model of what  presenting cognition in an informal education setting
              means.  A  report will be published and broadly disseminated by professional 
              museum organizations.  It is estimated that the project will reach 
              approximately 629,000 visitors annually which includes 69,000  students and 550
              teachers.
