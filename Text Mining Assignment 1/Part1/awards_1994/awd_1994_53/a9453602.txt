              Leading to Active Transformation of Teacher Education    Practicing K-12
              teachers are in residence in mathematics and  science departments at the
              collegiate level  working in partnership with and as a resource for  collegiate
              faculty developing and teaching introductory  courses in mathematics and the
              sciences designed for prospective teachers, K-12, of mathematics and the
              sciences.  The teacher's residence provides a year long professional
              development  experience for teachers who will be an integral component of
              successful field experiences for preservice teachers.  The program also
              encourages participating teachers to become lifelong learners.  The
              postsecondary faculty members benefit by having a rich resource from which to
              develop new content and pedagogy.  The project brings solid content knowledge
              as well as classroom experiences and insights into the way young people do and
              learn mathematics and the sciences.
