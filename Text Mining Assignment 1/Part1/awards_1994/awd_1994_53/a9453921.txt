Abstract    :
              9453921  Amara    A pilot manufacturing laboratory facility has been established
              at  Minuteman Science and Technology High School.  A formal three year 
              curriculum in manufacturing technology has been developed.    This project will
              over the next four years develop an integrated  manufacturing instructional
              model for thirty (30) women and  minority teachers grades 6-12.  Participants
              will be introduced to  the project via 3 seminars held in the spring.  The
              seminars will  be on equity issues, manufacturing technology and each summer
              over  the life of the project the participants will receive an intensive  three
              (3) week workshop on current trends and practices in  manufacturing.  Topics
              include automation, electronics, mechanics  and bio manufacturing.  Emphasis
              will be placed upon integrating  mathematics and science, the importance of
              communication and human  relations, technology skills related to manufacturing,
              career  awareness, hands-on activities appropriate for junior and senior  high
              student.  Each academic year the original thirty teachers will  acquire more
              complex integrated math/science and technology skills  coupled with specific
              workshops on women and minority issues as  they begin to develop integrated
              projects suited to their teaching  environment.  The project emphasizes a
              realistic view of science  and technology as problem solving activities which
              require skill in  collaboration, experimentation, writing, computing and the
              pursuit  of exploration.  The amount requested is $361,116 for 54 months  with
              cost share of $815,179.
