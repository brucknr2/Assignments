Abstract    :
                  Award Number: 9453606    Five colleges of the City University of New York
              (Brooklyn College,   College of Staten Island, City College, Hunter College and
              Lehman   College) together with New York University, are part of the  New York
              Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation; formed   to restructure
              the preparation of prospective teachers of grades K to   12. The Collaborative
              goal is to increase the number of college   graduates entering science and
              mathematics teaching at all academic   levels, and better equip them for
              teaching these subject areas to New   York's culturally, ethnically,
              economically and linguistically diverse   population. New links are being
              created: on the college campus,   between education and liberal arts faculties,
              and among the various   science and mathematics faculties; in each borough,
              between colleges   and school districts; in the university community, among
              various   colleges; and city-wide, between all participants and local  
              science-rich institutions and museums.     The Collaborative is engaged in six
              interrelated clusters of   activities, including: 1) developing new approaches
              to teaching and   assessing science and mathematics in college courses, so that
                prospective teachers themselves experience learning in ways envisioned   by
              national reform efforts, and become familiar with exemplary   curriculum
              resources; 2) establishing a new program for middle  school teachers; 3)
              developing new training materials with special   emphasis on design of
              curriculum units which reflect collaboration   among faculty of varied
              disciplines and school teachers, and that   utilize the urban context; 4)
              providing student support and career   development, including follow-up of
              first year teachers and   internships in settings such as college tutoring
              centers, school   classrooms, and local science museums; 5) recruiting
              promising   students into teaching; and 6) developing exemplary field sites for
                student teachers.
