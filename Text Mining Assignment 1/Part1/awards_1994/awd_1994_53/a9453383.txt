Abstract    :
              This research concerns the design and implementation of autonomous  agents, that
              is, of computer programs that have sustained  interactions with a dynamic,
              incompletely predictable environment,  examples being mobile robots, factory
              control programs, and  programs for database consistency management.  To
              facilitate the   design and construction of very sophisticated autonomous
              agents, it  is important to develop appropriate program specification 
              techniques, planning algorithms, and learning methods, and these  tasks have
              formed the focus of the researcher's previous work.   Areas to be emphasized in
              the continuing research are the  integration of learning methods with
              pre-programmed strategies and  the integration of low-level, reactive methods
              with higher-level  planning approaches.  In addition, some technical problems
              of  reinforcement learning will be studied.  One of these will be the  effect
              of preprogrammed knowledge and structure on the learning  process.  Another
              will be efficient learning where relevant aspects  of the environment are
              inaccessible to the agent's sensory systems.   Planning in stochastic domains
              will also be explored.
