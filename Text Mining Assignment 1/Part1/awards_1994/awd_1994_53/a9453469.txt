Abstract    :
              9453469  Stewart       The long-term goal of the research in Caro-Beth Stewart's
               laboratory is to understand the molecular basis for adaptive  evolution of
              higher organisms, such as humans.  That is, the  research is aimed at
              understanding how changes in DNA and protein  sequence are responsible for
              observed differences between species.   To address this large goal, Stewart's
              current research primarily  focuses on the regulatory and structural/functional
              evolution of  digestive enzymes in animals with different diets.  The digestive
               tract is an ideal place to look for evidence of adaptive evolution  because
              the gut mucosa contacts the external environment, and diets  can shift rapidly
              due to environmental or behavioral changes.  The  gut is genetically plastic,
              showing morphological adaptations to  the diet of a species and expression of
              relevant digestive enzymes  in different regions.  A change in the expression
              pattern of an  enzyme can place it under new selection pressures, which may
              drive  the evolution of its primary structure and function.  This research 
              will help elucidate how organisms adapt genetically to  environmental change. 
              In addition, it will give insight into  changes that are allowed in protein
              sequence, structure, and  function.
