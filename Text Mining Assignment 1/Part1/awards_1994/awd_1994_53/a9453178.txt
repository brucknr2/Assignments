Abstract    :
              9453178  Royster    Kentucky Science and Technology Council will host a one-day 
              regional conference focused on educational policy issues  critical to systemic
              reform in rural, poor school districts.   The participants will feature state
              superintendents of  education and other policy-makers in the six states
              involved  with the Appalachia Rural Systemic Initiative.  Expected  outcomes
              are an increased understanding of systemic reform in  isolated schools; and
              educational policy commitments by the  participating states.  ***
