Abstract    :
                The project develops an  operating system called SPIN that provides
              fine-grained control to  applications over physical resources in ways  that are
              safe, predictable and  efficient.  The SPIN system is structured around an
              extensible microkernel  architecture.  The  system is extensible in the sense
              that application programs  can  dynamically install restricted program
              sequences that execute in  the  kernel in response to a set of pre-defined
              events allowing  for flexible and  rapid response.  For example, an application
               program could install a scheduling  filter that runs each time a  thread from
              that program's address space is  preempted.    The notion of event filtering
              can be applied to a wide class of  events and services, including virtual
              memory, scheduling,  network  communication, local interprocess communication
              and disk  management.  By  viewing system resource management as a process  by
              which physical resources are  reassigned across applications,  and interpreting
              each reassignment as a  discreet event, SPIN defines critical control points
              for application  feedback, enabling  dynamic resource allocation policies.  By
              associating  application-defined control sequences with these control points,
              SPIN   enforces a wide range of policies at each event, enabling a single 
              operating  system to work well across many types of applications.  By executing
              the control  sequences within the kernel, the dynamic  control is achieved with
              very low  overhead.
