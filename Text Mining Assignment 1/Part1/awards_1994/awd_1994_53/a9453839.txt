Abstract    :
              9453839  Gal-OR  This research will develop several theoretical models aimed  at
              understanding the state of the health care market. The  models are developed to
              capture the more realistic features  of the health care market, including those
              measures that are  proposed by the Health Care Reform Task Force. The health 
              care market consists of patients, providers, insurance  companies, "limited
              provider plans", such as HMO's and  PPO's, and government agencies. Given this
              complexity, the  study is designed to pay particular attention to 
              institutional details. One part of the study examines the  extent to which the
              provider  focuses on quality versus  price competition with other providers.
              Another part  examines the implications of the reimbursement rules and the 
              malpractice law upon the choice of a particular treatment  that is selected by
              the provider. The last part relates to  the design of an optimal reimbursement
              rule aimed at  inducing the provider to allocate appropriate resources to 
              improved quality and improved efficiency in delivering the  service to
              patients.       This study is important because it examines different 
              dimensions of the decisions that could be made by health  care providers.
              Moreover, this framework makes it possible  to evaluate the implications of
              various proposals that are  currently being considered and to predict how the
              decision-  making process efffects health care costs, the quality of  care
              provided to patients, and the size of the uninsured  population.
