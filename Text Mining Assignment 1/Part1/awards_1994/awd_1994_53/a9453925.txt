Abstract    :
                9453925  Benner    This three year project will provide internship experiences
              for 300 teachers  of grades 9-12 in the eleven counties and their school
              districts surrounding the Wright Laboratory.  The teachers will be engaged in
              research over two summers and will have additional courses and other
              enhancement workshops to transfer new content and pedagogical knowledge to
              their classrooms.  This will include 'real world' applications to discovery
              based approaches in their classrooms.  The project will start with a smaller
              number of teachers in the summer of 1995 (57) ramping up to  93 in year two and
              155 in year three or 1997.  Application is limited to teachers in the Ohio West
              Region of the Ohio State Systemic Initiative.  The cost share represents 56% of
              the funds requested from the Foundation.
