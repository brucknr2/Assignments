Abstract    :
              9453491  Ni         The award is for research in precision engineering,
              machining  technology, and quality control in manufacturing.  Research in 
              precision engineering is focused on cost-effective software-based  error
              compensation methods to improve machining accuracy, and  development of methods
              to enhance performance of coordinate  measurement machines.  Research issues to
              be addressed include  characterization of the thermal behavior of machine tools
              and  coordinate measurement machines, and development of statistical  sampling
              and evaluation methods for geometric dimensioning and  tolerancing requirements
              based on discrete measurement data.   Research in machining technology would
              focus on developing a  science based for drills and drilling processes, and
              prevention of  chatter in machining.  Research in quality control involves 
              utilization of advanced statistical techniques to deal with more  extensive
              process measurement data, and integration of automatic  process monitoring and
              diagnosis techniques with engineering  process knowledge.       Research in
              precision engineering is important for both  commercial applications and
              weapons systems, and offers great  potential for improving manufacturing
              competitiveness.  Drilling is  the most commonly used material removal process,
              accounting for  more than 80 percent of chips produced.  Chatter is a
              significant  barrier to increase productivity in machining in general. 
              Research  in drilling and chatter is thus of great practical importance.  The 
              new generation of quality control methods proposed here is  important for
              industrial competitiveness, and is needed to  accommodate current production
              practices which result in more  extensive measurement data.
