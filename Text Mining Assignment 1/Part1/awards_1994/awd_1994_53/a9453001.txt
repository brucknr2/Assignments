Abstract    :
              9453001  Rankin    SOUNDPRINT is requesting $901,273 over 16 months to produce a
               series of radio documentaries entitled Making Connections:  SOUNDPRINT
              Explores Science and Technology, related educational  outreach materials,
              multimedia non-broadcast applications, and an  aggressive distribution plan.   
              Sixteen half-hour original science documentaries, distributed  through national
              Public radio will address three broad areas of  science and technology.  These
              include: the limitations and  possibilities of scientific achievement; the
              requirements of  sustainability (surviving); and the explanation science offers
              for  human behavior.  An additional 21 programs will be repackaged as  special
              broadcasts to be distributed to over 200 public radio  stations.    Target
              audiences include middle school and secondary school  students, and adults.
