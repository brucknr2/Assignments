Abstract    :
              9453702  Lancaster    Project Women in Computer Science (WCS) is a
              multi-faceted, instructional and motivational  program involving both
              university faculty and corporate personnel to recruit additional women 
              students to Bowling Green State University's undergraduate computer science
              program.  Project  WCS offers several instructional and motivational
              activities:  1) recruitment activities designed  specifically to encourage
              freshmen and sophomore college women to consider computer science  as a major,
              2) a mentoring program which involves both faculty and business representatives
               serving as mentors, 3) formal preparation for cooperative education work
              assignments, and 4)  workshops for computer science faculty and business
              representatives on gender-related issues that  impact women's success in
              computer science programs and computing careers.  The project  components are
              built upon current understanding of social, learning, and teaching factors
              which  facilitate the interest, motivation, and achievement of women in science
              fields.    Both computer science faculty and computing professionals from
              business and industry will be  actively involved in working with the
              participants in a number of ways, including both academic  and corporate
              mentors for each participant.  This integrated use of mentoring, cooperative 
              education, and university/corporate interaction to increase the participation
              of women in the field  is unique.  A Corporate Advisory Board (state-wide) will
              be directly involved with the project  co-directors in all aspects of the
              project.    ***
