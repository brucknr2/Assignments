Abstract    :
              9453796  Bash    The University of Texas at Austin's McDonald Observatory is 
              requesting $581,736 over three years to produce and distribute a  Spanish
              language version of Star Date, a daily radio program that  covers astronomy,
              space exploration, and other space-related  topics.  The purpose of the new
              program is to increase scientific  literacy among the Spanish-speaking segment
              of the American  population, inspire a greater interest in astronomy and space 
              science, and encourage younger listeners to enter space or other 
              science-related fields.  Collateral ancillary material related to  astronomy
              will also be developed and distributed.
