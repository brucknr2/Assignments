Abstract    :
              9453883  Thompson  Georgia Tech Research Corporation, Georgia Tech Research
              Institute,  and Clark Atlanta University are creating a Multimedia In 
              Manufacturing Education (MIME) program dedicated to rapidly  producing
              multimedia courseware suitable for manufacturing  education programs.  The
              project taps into the recent investment in  educational technology
              infrastructure at Georgia Tech to deliver  world-class instruction.  By linking
              this infrastructure with  evaluation programs and research into how to teach
              with these new  media, this program could help revolutionize manufacturing 
              education, Emerging information superhighways such as the Internet  would allow
              rapid distribution of these materials nationwide.
