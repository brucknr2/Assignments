Abstract    :
              9453447  David G. Schatz            This research focuses on understanding how
              vertebrate organisms  change the structure of their DNA, particularly through
              site  specific recombination.  Specifically, the PI  will examine the  process
              by which lymphocytes assemble their antigen receptor genes,  studying both the
              enzymology and molecular basis of this site  specific recombination reaction. 
              This work has implications beyond  immunology, because the PI  will analyze
              what other cell types  besides lymphocytes may make use of such site specific
              mechanisms  to encode genetic information.  In particular, he will also study 
              processes in the nervous system.  Dr. Schatz Proposes to create  transgenic
              mice in which the expression, but none has been adapted  successfully for use
              in a living mammal.  Such a system would  provide a powerful new tool for the
              study of development and gene  function.  Analyses of these mice will provide a
              variety of  insights into several different biological realms:  (1) the immune 
              system; (2) the enzymology of site specific recombination in  vertebrates; (3)
              the integrity of the genome; and (4) the discovery  of other site specific
              recombination processes in vertebrates.   These experiments will provide a new
              vantage point from which to  view the vertebrate genome, the forces that
              protect it, and the  processes that alter it.  ***
