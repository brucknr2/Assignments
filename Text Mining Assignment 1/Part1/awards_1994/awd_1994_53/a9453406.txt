Abstract    :
              9453406  BURGESS  This award provides support to Dr. Curt Burgess under the 
              National Science Foundation's Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF)  Program.  The
              PFF Program was established at the request of the  President of the United
              States to recognize and support the  scholarly activities of some of the
              Nation's most outstanding  science and engineering faculty members early in
              their careers.   Awards are intended to allow Fellows to undertake
              self-designed,  innovative research and teaching projects, to establish
              research  and teaching programs, and to pursue other academic related 
              activities.    This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research in
               psycholinguistics.  Three areas will be pursued:  (1) the  structure in
              language and how the human language processor  assigns syntactic structure to
              incoming language; (2) memory  retrieval in language understanding and the role
              of sentence  level constraints on recognition processes; and (3) development 
              of computational memory retrieval systems in order to mimic human 
              lexical/semantic memory.     This research is important to understanding the
              dynamics of human  memory retrieval, and how humans integrate new knowledge
              into an  existing mental representation.  In addition, it will result in a 
              better specification of the higher-level neural processes  involved in language
              comprehension, and a better understanding of  how people recover from making
              errors of lexical or syntactic  misassignment during the comprehension process.
               Ultimately, this  knowledge can assist in more applied problems such as
              reading  impairment and language rehabilitation after stroke.  This five  year
              award will also enable Dr. Burgess to train undergraduate  and graduate
              students in interdisciplinary research areas  spanning psycholinguistics,
              cognitive neuropsychology, and  modeling with neural networks.
