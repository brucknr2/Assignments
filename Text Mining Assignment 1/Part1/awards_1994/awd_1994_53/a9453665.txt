Abstract    :
              9453665  Snead  The Detroit Urban Systemic Initiative has as its core a  vision
              that seeks to improve the mathematics, science and  technology literacy of all
              K-12 students in the Detroit  Public Schools.  Key elements of the Initiative
              are: (1)  twenty-three K-12 constellations (a neighborhood high school  with
              feeder middle and elementary schools); (2) a core  curriculum based on the NCTM
              Standards and emerging NAS  science standards and that includes practical
              applications,  African-centered/multicultural perspectives, algebra for all 
              students and state-of-the-art technology; (3) a teacher  enhancement program
              that targets all professional staff and  focuses on enhancing content
              knowledge, improving  instructional strategies, and altering belief systems;
              (4)  systemwide organizational and policy changes that will  address equal
              access, flexibility and change attitudes; and  (5) redeployment of extant
              resources.  Organizational  changes include establishing K-12 constellations as
              learning  communities, increased use of mathematics specialists in all 
              elementary schools, and plans to attract, retain and certify  minority
              mathematics and science teachers.  Community  collaborations and partnerships,
              parent programs, and career  counseling are designed to support achievement of
              the goals  of the USI.
