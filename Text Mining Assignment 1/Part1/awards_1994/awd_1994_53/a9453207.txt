Abstract    :
                9453207  Ziebarth      Teacher Enhancement at Supercomputing '94  IEEE     
              This conference proposal brings a total of 160 teachers, 41 of whom are 
              directly funded through this award, from across the country to the 
              Supercomputing '94 in Washington, DC for three days if pre-conference 
              workshop.  The first two-days include hands-on workshops, presentations and 
              demonstrations by experts as well as teachers in currently successful high 
              school supercomputing programs.  Teachers also have full registration for 
              Supercomputing '94 included with the workshop so they can visit the exhibits, 
              poster session, and special presentations at the conference.      Cost sharing
              is provided for administrative costs to IEEE by the Computer  Society, one of
              the member societies of the IEEE, and for hardware rental.   Cost sharing is
              40%.
