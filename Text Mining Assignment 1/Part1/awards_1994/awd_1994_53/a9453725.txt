Abstract    :
              9453725  Warren    Through the initiative of the Consortium for Adult Education,
              the Women Ventures in Science,  Engineering and Math project was created with
              the collaboration of the two- and four-year  colleges and universities in the
              Cincinnati area, along with the primary organizations for  workforce
              development programs for women on public assistance.  The thrust of this
              project is  to provide a pathway to economic self sufficiency and family
              stability for these minority women  through careers in the fields of science,
              engineering, and math (SEM).  The project focuses on  outreach, recruitment,
              assessment, preparation and ongoing support so that the target group can 
              matriculate into SEM majors and become high performance workers in a high tech
              work place.   The project begins with an effective marketing campaign that
              sells the benefits of careers in  SEM, with the outcome of 300-400 of the
              target group attending one of the two scheduled SEM  Career Fairs.  From this
              pool, 100-150 women will be selected through a holistic assessment  process to
              participate in one of two 240 hour  preparatory program.  The assessment will
              assist  the women in self discovery, identifying transferrable skills and
              aptitudes, and committing to a  career in SEM.    Preparatory sessions will
              provide the women with full exposure to the advantages/disadvantages  of SEM
              careers, survival skills in male dominated occupations, self motivation
              techniques,  academic refresher opportunities, a support system, and an
              individual service strategy.  Upon  completion of the 240 hour course, 50 women
              will matriculate into SEM majors at the two- and  four-year
              colleges/universities.  After the women start their educations, the
              collaborating  institutions will provide ongoing support and direction to
              ensure graduation and employment.   A College Advisory Committee has been
              established and will provide ongoing guidance and  direction to the project. 
              It is expected that once this model project is demonstrated to be  effective,
              the  process will be institutionalized and made part of the ongoing operation
              of the  organization that are responsible for the workforce development
              activities of women on public  assistance.  ***
