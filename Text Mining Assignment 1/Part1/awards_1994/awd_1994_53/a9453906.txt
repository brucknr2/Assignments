Abstract    :
              HRD-9453906  Stephen R. Cox  PATHS/PRISM  Suite 700  7 Benjamin Franklin Pkwy. 
              Philadelphia, PA  19103-1294    "A Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities
              for the   Greater  Philadelphia Region"    The National Science Foundation's
              Comprehensive Regional Center for  Minorities (CRCM) in Philadelphia as a
              representative of the  Greater Philadelphia Consortium and PATHS/PRISM:  The
              Philadelphia  Partnership for Education, is composed of four metropolitan
              school  districts; seventeen universities, colleges, and community  colleges,
              museums; corporations; non-profit partnerships;; and  minority professional and
              community organizations.  The goal of the  CRCM is to significantly increase
              the number of minority students,  (specifically African-Americans, Latinos and
              Native Americans,  preparing for science, engineering and mathematics (SEM)
              education  and careers.  The fulfillment of the CRCM's mission and goal is 
              being accomplished through the integration of three principal  components: 
              pre-college professional development programs, pre-  college student programs,
              and college student programs.            The CRCM has functioned to strengthen
              the educational pipeline and  to indirectly create systemic impact through
              strategic intervention  in the region.  As of the end of year III, the CRCM has
              serviced  approximately 4413 students and 300 teachers.  In year IV, the CRCM 
              is taking the strengths and experiences of the first three years  and applying
              these best practices to a K-12th grade cluster of  schools, as well as
              continuing programs which have been successful  in meeting our goal.  The CRCM
              is working very closely with the  school District of Philadelphia and other
              Consortium partners to  develop strong mathematics and science school clusters.
               The real  value of this system of strong  clusters across the district will 
              be to sustain the long-term goals of moving students successfully  through the
              pipeline and strengthening teachers in future years.  ***
