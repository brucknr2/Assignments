Abstract    :
              9453920  Hazen    SEEDS is a project intended to spearhead a revolution in the
              way  that elementary science is being taught in Stark County schools.   A local
              school-business alliance (TEEP), the Stark County School  District (an
              educational service agency) and 17 school districts  have joined forces to
              initiate the project.  The goal for the  project is to develop hands-on,
              minds-on elementary curriculum that  is integrated with language arts and
              mathematics.  This will be  accomplished via the mechanism of preparing Lead 
              Teachers/Leadership Teams of 200 teachers who will receive training  in
              leadership skills, science content, pedagogy and authentic  assessment.  These
              teams will subsequently work with all 1150  elementary science teachers in the
              county.  The process for the  typical teacher will begin with a unique
              'immersion' experience in  1995 to be followed over the course of the next five
              years with  further enhancement, that will be designed with the use of personal
               development plans so that each teacher continues to grow  professionally to
              meet their own personal needs.  These plans will  incorporate a total of 150
              hours of enhancement.  The request is for $4,489,226 with cost share estimated
              at  $3,049,683 (59%).
