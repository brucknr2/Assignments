Abstract    :
              9453913  Mansergh    Educational Cooperative Service Unit of the Metropolitan
              Twin  Cities Enhancing Mathematics and Science Teaching by Using  Computational
              Sciences    This 42 month leadership project trains teams of secondary 
              science, mathematics and computer science teachers in  computational science
              techniques.  Two groups of 35 teachers from  the Twin Cities area receive 18
              months training each.  This  includes three weeks in each of two consecutive
              summer summers  and periodic sessions during the school year.  Participants
              work  in teams of three from schools or districts and support, enrich,  and
              reinforce each other.  These teams in turn train other  teachers through a
              variety of workshops, seminars, and classes  held around the state and region. 
              They develop discipline-based  activities which are shared with their
              colleagues and made  available on the Internet nationwide.      Continued
              support for the project is anticipated because both  ECSU and TIES, the project
              partners, are established region  service organizations which work closely with
              school districts,  colleges and universities as well as local businesses and 
              industries.  The project includes involvement from many  businesses in the
              area, all working to support the project  through speakers, site visits,
              resources, mentors, and other  methods.    Cost sharing on the project is 100%.
