Abstract    :
              Under this Presidential Faculty fellow (PFF) award, upper ocean dynamics and the
              roles of the oceans in global climate change will be investigated by developing
              new and innovative ways of studying and predicting upper ocean processes,
              air-sea interaction and global climat changes, and by developing new remote
              sensing models to determine and predict surface and subsurface ocean processes.
              The equatorial Pacific Ocean and ENSO events will be chosen as the major focus
              of the study because of their significant impact on gloabl climate. New
              interdisciplinary courses in remote sensing will also be developed for graduate
              and undergraduate students.
