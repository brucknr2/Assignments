Abstract    :
                   Our goal is to develop both a theoretical and practical  foundation for
              teacher professional development -- with particular  relevance to teachers of
              culturally and linguistically diverse  children -- that combines ongoing
              teacher inquiry in science with  classroom-based inquiry on learning and
              teaching.  The research  will consist of analysis of a corpus of videotapes of
              a teacher  research group and the teachers' classrooms collected over the past 
              three years as part of our prior RTL project on the interplay  between
              scientific and everyday discourses in Haitian Creole and  Spanish bilingual
              classorooms.  Interatively applying methods of  discourse analysis to this
              courpus, we will develop two studies of  teacher learning, one in evolution and
              one in experimentation and  argumentation, in order to characterize what and
              how the teachers  are learning about science, student learning, and classroom 
              practice. in a final monograph, we will set forth a model of  professional
              development based on our findings.
