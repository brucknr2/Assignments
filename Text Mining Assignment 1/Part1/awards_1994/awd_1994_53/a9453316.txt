Abstract    :
              9453316  Willner  Optical communications research shall be undertaken in which
              the  fundamental capabilities of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM)  will
              be analyzed.  This work will include 1) the definition of  optimal systems
              guidelines in systems employing Er-doped Fiber  Amplifiers (EDFA's) and 2) the
              study of all-optical wavelength  shifing in a systems configuration. 
              Educational issues to be  addressed during the period of support include the
              preparation of  a text-book discussing WDM Optical Communications Systems, and
              the  development of a scientific leadership course.  ***
