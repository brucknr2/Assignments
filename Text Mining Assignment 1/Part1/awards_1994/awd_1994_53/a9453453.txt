Abstract    :
              9453453  Chang-Hasnain  Topic areas included in this research grant include: 
              two-  dimensional semiconductor diode lasers and optoelectronic devices;  novel
              epitaxial growth and fabrication techniques; and the  applications of these
              devices in novel optical interconnects and  communications architecture. 
              Specific projects include single  mode, multi-wavelength vertical cavity
              surface emitting laser  arrays, novel micromachined wavelength vertical cavity
              surface  emitting laser arrays, novel micromachined wavelength tunable laser 
              and switches, and WDM optical networks implementations.  ***
