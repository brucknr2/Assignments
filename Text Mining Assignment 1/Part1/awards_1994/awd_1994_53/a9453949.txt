Abstract    :
              9453949  Lipka    This planning project, sponsored by the University of Alaska
              at  Fairbanks, will prepare its target community, the Yup'ik, to submit  a
              proposal to the Teacher Enhancement Program which will train  Yup'ik teachers
              and Yup'ik elders to use the most up-to-date  curriculums in science and
              mathematics.  The activities supported  by the grant are to:    -    identify
              personnel to strengthen the science component of the       project;  -   
              coordinate activities with other NSF projects in Alaska;  -    identify, adapt
              and prepare teacher materials for a more       comprehensive elementary science
              program;  -    continue to maintain close communication with the Yup'ik      
              community; and,   -    develop a Teacher Enhancement proposal intended to
              implement       the Planning grants long-term objectives.    The matching
              funds, in support of the project, amount to 24% of the  NSF grant.
