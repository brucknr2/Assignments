Abstract    :
              9453776  Wolf    The Museums of the Rockies will develop a 2450 sq. ft. exhibit 
              titled Landforms/Lifeforms and complementary educational materials  including
              teacher enhancement activities, outreach trunks, and  other programming.  The
              exhibit will serve as the pivotal  experience for visitors as they engage the
              museum's theme One Place  Through All Of Time and it serve to introduce all
              other permanent  exhibit galleries.  Using the important and spectacular
              geological  and paleontological resources of the region and the museum's 
              collections, the exhibit will bring to life the concept of the  evolution and
              diversification of life in response to changing  geological conditions from the
              Precambrian to the end of the  Mesozoic.  Visitors will experience the Northern
              Rocky Mountain  Region and the life supported by that region over time. 
              Critical  thinking skills of visitors will be stimulated with the purpose of 
              enhancing their overall science literacy.  The exhibit is designed  to promote
              adult-child interaction.  Special attention is being  given to attracting a
              rural audience.  Complementary programming  aimed at K-12 students and teachers
              will be developed.  The content  of these activities will address the goals set
              forth in Montana's  systemic initiative and the Systemic Teacher Excellence
              Preparation  program.  The educational materials will also be shared with
              member  museums in the Mid-Continent University Natural History Museum 
              Consortium.
