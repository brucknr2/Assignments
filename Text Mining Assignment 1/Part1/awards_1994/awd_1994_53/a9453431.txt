Abstract    :
              9453431  Gleiser       This project is aimed at studying the interface between
              high-  energy particle physics and cosmology by examining in detail the 
              dynamics of phase transitions in the early universe.  The study  of such
              systems both in and out of equilibrium involves both  analytical and numerical
              methods to understand the approach to  equilibrium and the nature of phase
              transitions in field  theories.  The project also has potential overlap with
              topics in  condensed matter physics, such as liquid crystals and binary  fluid
              mixtures.  ***
