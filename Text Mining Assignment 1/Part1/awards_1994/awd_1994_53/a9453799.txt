Abstract    :
              9453799  Haynes    ABSTRACT     Cornell University is producing a documentary
              television program about the 100-meter radio telescope in Green Bank, West
              Virginia.  The film, planned as a PBS special, will document the engineering
              and technology behind the construction of the telescope as well as examining
              and explaining the science of radio astronomy.  Ancillary educational material,
              including a 20 minute version of the video, will be developed and distributed
              for use in informal education setting through the American Astronomical Society
              and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.  In addition images and
              information about the Green Bank Telescope and the science of radio astronomy
              will be made available through an electronic bulletin board service such as
              GOPHER or MOSAIC.  Teaching materials also will be developed for use in the
              secondary school curriculum and an "Across Space and Time" undergraduate
              curriculum developed at Cornell University will be made available to faculty at
              other colleges and universities.  In addition, the film and related material
              will serve as the centerpiece for short courses for college teachers at Green
              Bank under the National Chautauqua Short Course Program.     The PI and major
              content developer is Martha Haynes, Professor of Astronomy at Cornell
              University associated with the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center and the
              Center for Radiophysics and Space Research.  The film is being produced by
              PhotoSynthesis Production of Ithaca, New York.  David Gluck is co-producer,
              director, and cinematographer and Deborah Hoard is co-producer and writer.  A
              twelve person advisory committee of astronomers, teachers, and informal science
              educators will guide development of the project.
