Abstract    :
              9453678  Lambert    The goal of the project, Science of Living Spaces, is to
              encourage girls in science, engineering  and mathematics (SEM) and give them
              the knowledge and confidence to consider SEM as a  career choice.  The
              mechasism is an intensive 3 week summer session in which 25 7th and 8th  grade
              girls from rural areas (Isle of Wight and Charles City counties) reside at CNU
              during the  week.      The girls will participate in projects in biology,
              chemistry, computer science, math, engineering,  and physics, all of which
              relate to the theme of living spaces.  There will be almost no lecture -  - the
              girls will actually learn by doing:  for living in the home, they will study
              electricity and  build circuits; for living in the community, they will study
              the environment and measure  greenhouse gases; and, for living in space, they
              will visit the Richmond Math and Science  Center, and experiment with being
              scientists in a simulated control lab, as well as being  astronauts in
              (simulated) space.  In addition to doing SEM activities, the girls will learn
              about  themselves and about careers in science through off-site visits and
              through guest speakers.   Contact will be maintained with the girls after they
              leave through email, and with two visits  during the next school year.  ***
