Abstract    :
                      This award supports the research of Andrew Granville and  covers a broad
              range of areas of mathematics, primarily in number  theory, with applications
              to computer science.  The research  builds on Granville's understanding of the
              distribution of  primes.  The award also supports his continued work in both 
              graduate and undergraduate education as well as his exposition.           This
              Presidential Faculty Fellow award to Andrew Granville  is for excellent
              research and teaching in number theory.  Number  theory starts with the whole
              numbers and questions such as the  divisibility of one whole number by another.
               It is among the  oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued
              for  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,  it has
              become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for  computer science and
              new error correcting codes for electronics.
