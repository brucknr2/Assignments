Abstract    :
              9453022  Parrish  The Cleveland USI seeks to reform the District's K-12
              mathematics  and science education program so that its students achieve at the 
              same levels as students in the highest achieving districts in the  State.  To
              accomplish this, the USI aims to: (1) develop a climate  of supportamong
              teachers, students and administrators at all  schools; (2) increase student
              motivation for success by giving  students more responsibility for their
              education, infusing  multiculturalism into the curriculum, and developing
              increased  awareness of connections between science, mathematics and 
              technology (SMT) curriculum and careers; (3) strengthen school-site  leadership
              through teacher leaders and School Improvement Plans;  (4) implement a
              national, standards-based, student-centered SMT  curriculum; (5) provide an
              extensive student support system; (6)  provide professional development for all
              teachers and  administrators led by the district's Center for School
              Improvement  and Professional Development in partnership with extant NSF-funded
               programs; and (7) develop collaborations with parents and community  partners
              to support the SMT curriculum and involve them in the  delivery of professional
              development and student support.
