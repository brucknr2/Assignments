Abstract    :
              HRD-#9453829  Center for Accessible Technology  Lisa Wahl, Principal
              Investigator  "Science Access for All Students (SAAS)"                         
                     ABSTRACT    The Center for Accessible Technology, working cooperatively
              with the NSF-supported State  Systemic Initiative (SSI), California Advocacy
              for Mathematics and Science (CAMS) will  conduct a one-year pilot project that
              will establish a model for improving instructional  delivery for students with
              disabilities, in grades 3-6.  The outcome is a plan for teacher  enhancement
              that would be activated statewide first in elementary school science and later
              in  middle school mathematics.  The project, entitled Science Access for All
              Students, has the  following goals:    o    Science curricula will be reviewed
              and made accessible for all  students,   o    Science educators and staff
              developers in California will be  prepared to meet the       needs of students
              with disabilities,  o    A selection of elementary schools where students with 
              disabilities are mainstreamed       will be established as model sites for
              total inclusion in science curricula,  o    A replicable model for
              accessibility review and staff development will be       disseminated, and  o  
               A proposal for statewide enhancement of teaching science and  mathematics to  
                  students with disabilities will be developed.    These goals will be
              achieved through a process of reviewing the accessibility of instructional 
              materials, adapting instructional materials, providing on-site support and
              professional  development, and disseminating findings and procedures.
