Abstract    :
              ESI-9453205    This national project brings together the American Meteorological
               Society in cooperation with the National Weather Service, The  Weather Channel
              and members of the AMS professional society.  During five years, 4,100 teachers
              from grades K-12 will be trained  directly, in an intensive course offered
              twice yearly, on  atmospheric and related Earth environments. The course is
              based on  electronically transmitted  data streams and learning materials 
              delivered in real time. It will emphasize the teaching of  integrated science
              through problem-focused or event driven  investigations of the natural
              environment. Leader teachers, those  who have completed the twenty two days of
              training, will act as  resource persons within their schools, reaching a second
              tier of at  least 41,000 teachers. At the same time, they will work towards 
              raising the awareness administrators, parents and school board  members  of the
              educational potential of electronically-delivered  data streams in their
              schools.  The course will be implemented  through 50 Local Implementation Teams
              composed of experienced  teachers, college faculty and professional
              meteorologists. The KEY  to the this aspect of the project is it will be its
              delivery via a  combination of group meetings, by Internet or more commonly
              using  the Vertical Blanking Interval of the Weather Channel.
