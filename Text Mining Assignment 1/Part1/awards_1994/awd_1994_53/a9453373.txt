Abstract    :
              The  research  consists  of two separate  projects,  in  discrete  robotic 
              system design and discrete motion planning.  First,  the  kinematics,  motion 
              planning, and design of  robotic  mechanisms  with  binary  actuators  are
              investigated.   Robots  with  binary  (on-off)  actuators  have  a  finite 
              number  of  states.   Major  benefits  of  binary-actuated manipulators are
              that they  can  be  operated  without extensive feedback control, task 
              repeatability  is  very  high,  and  two-state actuators  are    generally 
              very  inexpensive,  thus  resulting in reliable  low  cost  robots  for 
              industrial    use.    Second,   the   design   and   coordination 
              of`metamorphic'  robotic systems for use in unknown  environments  are 
              investigated.   A  metamorphic  robot  is  a  collection  of  independent
              modules each of which occupies a space in a  lattice,  and  has  the  ability 
              to locomote over adjacent  modules.   The  morphology of the collection of
              modules changes as a function  of  the   collective   motion.   Such 
              self-reconfigurability   gives  metamorphic  robots unique abilities. For
              instance,  modules  can  `flow' into crevasses unreachable by fixed morphology
              robots,  or  grow  to  form structures which envelop objects and  form  stable 
              grasps.
