Abstract    :
              The purpose of the Georgia State University Mathematics Teacher Education
              Co-Reform Project is to initiate collaboration on professional practice among
              faculty contributing to our teacher education programs and to reform the first
              two courses based on collaboration.  The first goal is to establish
              intra-university collaboration between Education and Arts & Sciences and
              university-school collaboration between university faculty and public school
              teachers.  The second goal is to integrate mathematics  content, pedagogy,
              technology, and field experiences in preserve secondary mathematics teacher
              education courses.
