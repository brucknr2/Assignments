Abstract    :
              9453150  Wright    The Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement project
              is  the result of a collaboration between five Alabama school  districts and
              the University of Alabama, Huntsville (UAH).  The  project will combine
              resources from the school districts, UAH and  local engineers and scientists to
              support a hands-on, module-  based science curriculum.  The curriculum to be
              implemented will  include NSF funded STC, FOSS, and Insights materials as 
              instructional modules.  The five school districts will also  support a
              Materials Resource Center that will supply and  refurbish materials for
              teachers and provide professional  development for teachers and principals.   
              During this five-year project, 518 teachers will receive 100  hours of
              professional development and 102 selected lead teachers  will receive
              substantial enhancement of 230-400 hours. This  extensive training will build
              local capability for continued  improvement after the project expires.    The
              summer program focuses on the enhancement of the lead  teachers.  They will
              analyze  progress made during the past year,  plan follow-up activities and
              prepared new workshops for teachers  and principals in the upcoming school
              year.  They will provide  leadership to the teachers in their schools for
              implementing  change.  Three of these lead teachers will be chosen to become 
              full time project staff so they can conduct workshops, visit  schools to assist
              in on-site enhancement, and guide district and  multi-district teacher
              enhancement sessions.  Lead teacher-  principal teams will inform parents about
              the program.    Cost sharing is 117% of the total NSF requested budget.    ***
