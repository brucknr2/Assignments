Abstract    :
              9453820  Prados  This project will support workshops as a mechanism for reaching
               consensus among the principal stakeholders on two key issues in  engineering
              education: 1)The need for and form of revised  accreditation criteria that will
              maintain a strong focus on  quality professional preparation while offering
              flexibility for  major innovations in curricular structure and delivery
              methods,  and 2) The need for and form of a simplified, non-adversarial 
              accreditation process grounded in the philosophy of continuous  improvement. 
              Two carefully structured workshops jointly  sponsored by the Foundation and
              ABET would provide the forum  for the needed discussions and constitute a
              significant step  toward resolving the central issues.  Attendance would be 
              limited and would include leaders of the key stakeholder groups  for
              engineering accreditation.  ***
