Abstract    :
              9453034  Deigl    LightPower is one of twelve permanent exhibits being developed
              for  the new Orlando Science Center (OSC) in Orlando, Florida.  A 4,000  square
              foot exhibit, LightPower places lasers in their broad  scientific context by
              focusing on light, the electromagnetic  spectrum, and on lasers and their
              applications.  Because of the  large number of laser-optics research facilities
              and corporations  in the Central Florida region, the exhibit also includes The
              Optics  Workbench, a career-themed activity center which emphasizes careers  in
              optics and in scientific and technical fields that utilize  lasers.   
              LightPower is being developed by a partnership that includes the  Orlando
              Science Center, the Orange County Public Schools, and the  Center for Research
              and Education in Electro-Optics and Lasers at  the University of Central
              Florida.  The partnership will develop,  prototype, and evaluate interactive
              exhibit components and  associated text and labels in English and Spanish; and
              will  develop, evaluate, and distribute hands-on career-related  activities in
              English and Spanish for students and teachers.    The goal of the LightPower
              exhibit is to contribute to the  educational infrastructure of the Central
              Florida region by:         -    Developing an interactive exhibit that
              facilitates            learning by a diverse public, including African
              Americans            and Latinos, and successfully communicating with both     
                    English and Spanish-speaking audiences.         -    Supporting middle
              school, junior high, and high school            science curricula, and
              producing and distributing printed            materials that detail the
              relationship between exhibit            components and specific curriculum
              performance standards.         -    Developing successful hands-on
              career-related activities            for students and teachers in both English
              and Spanish.
