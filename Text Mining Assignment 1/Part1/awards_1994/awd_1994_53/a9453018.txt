Abstract    :
              9453018  Thompson  The Los Angeles Urban Systemic Initiative (USI) is committed
              to having students attain world class standards in mathematics, science, and
              technology by developing student understanding of the importance of competence
              in these disciplines for success in today's society, and by preparing them for
              higher education and employment in mathematics and science-related fields as
              well as for productive citizenship.  To achieve these goals the LA USI will
              create schools that are centers of learning for everyone, students, teachers
              administrators, and parents and other adults; implement a rigorous  curriculum
              and enhanced teacher capacity to teach it; develop strong community
              partnerships; and greatly increase achievement expectations.  These strategies
              are carefully phased in and well staged over five years, starting with the
              introduction of 100 schools in the first year.  The LA USI will also develop
              its own bilingual teachers by actively recruiting prospective science and
              mathematics majors,  establishing a career ladder as incentive for bilingual
              teacher aides and offering science and mathematics classes in a second
              language.            ??
