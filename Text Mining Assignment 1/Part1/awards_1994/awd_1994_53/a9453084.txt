Abstract    :
              Previous funding from NSF to this group has led to the development  of a book of
              lessons for dealing with preconceptions in mechanics  that has shown very
              promising results in classroom trials.  Using  these lessons as a starting
              point, this project will develop a set  of instructional strategies for
              fostering meaningful learning and  conceptual change in science.  The project
              will: (1) conduct  studies of conceptual in pairs of students learning science;
              (2)  conduct studies of conceptual change in experts; (3) form these  studies
              develop more detailed theories of conceptual change  processes; (4) develop an
              accompanying set of effective  instructional strategies.  These strategies can
              be used by teachers  and curriculum developers to promote student literacy in
              science  and widen the population that has access to fundamental science 
              concepts.  Thus, the project in aimed at giving students broader  access to
              powerful scientific ideas.
