Abstract    :
              9453807  Schatz    The Pacific Science Center is requesting $800,000 over three
              and  one-half years to develop a national model which would enable  community
              agencies to incorporate science education into their  programs.  Through
              thirteen-week training programs, and developing  Community Center Workshops,
              individuals from community  organizations will acquire the skills necessary to
              become advocates  and providers for science enrichment.  A number of
              community-based  organizations which serve primarily minority clients have
              agreed to  collaborate with the Museum.
