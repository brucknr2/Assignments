Abstract    :
              Title:  Production of Prototype Guidebooks for Designing Year-Long Integrative
              System of Pedagogy Seminars and Non-Teaching CO-OP Experience as Components of
              Teacher Education Programs  Two guidebooks are being produced which lay out
              principals for developing and implementing the following two components of a
              teacher preparation program:  (1) a system of year-long pedagogy seminars
              commencing with the freshman year and held annually through the senior year for
              interactively introducing students to the precollege teaching profession, and 
              (2) a non-teaching cooperative education experience for each student in a
              industrial or other non-classroom site which is related to the area of
              certification pursued.  Drexel is planning, designing, and producing two
              guidebooks entitled:  (1) Guide for Year-long Integrative Pedagogy Seminars: 
              Early Introduction into the K-12 Teaching Profession, and  (2) Guide for
              Integrating a non-Teaching CO-OP Experience into Teacher Preparation.  These
              guidebooks are being disseminated to interested parties with follow-up
              electronic feedback made available.
