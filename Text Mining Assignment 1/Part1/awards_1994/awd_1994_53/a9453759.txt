Abstract    :
              9453759  BOYD    This is a 12-month planning grant for $31,863 to prepare a
              Systemic Teacher Enhancement  proposal for all 96 K-12 teachers in Jones County
              and will provide specific training for those  who teach mathematics.  The
              funding will bring together teachers, parents, and community  leaders in this
              rural, sparsely populated county.  The district will work with consultants from
               North Carolina State University, Meredith College, and the North Carolina
              Department of  Public Instruction.  The planning grant has cost sharing funds
              of $26,808.
