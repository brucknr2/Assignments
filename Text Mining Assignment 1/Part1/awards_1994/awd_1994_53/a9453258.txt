Abstract    :
              9453258  Bakum  Four community colleges and a technical university have formed 
              the New Jersey Consortium for Advanced Technological Education  to plan for
              and, ultimately, implement a Center for Advanced  Technological Education. 
              During the planning year, the  Consortium is inviting representatives of other
              postsecondary  institutions, school districts, business and industry, and 
              government agencies to join with them to assess the state of  advanced
              technological education in the region and structure a  center that would
              provided needed leadership in promoting  excellence in technological education.
               The planning structure  involves a three-tiered process that allows for
              maximum  involvement and input from participants while maintaining a  focus to
              ensure achievement of project objectives.  At the  conclusion of the planning
              process, the Consortium will have  developed a five-year plan for the Center
              that will include: a  mission statement, goals and objectives, activities,
              evaluation  process and strategies for funding the Center.  ***
