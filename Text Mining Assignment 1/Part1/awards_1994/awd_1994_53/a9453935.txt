Abstract    :
              9453935  Pine    This project is designed to promote district-wide change to
              hands-  on inquiry science teaching in the elementary schools of at least 
              fourteen school districts.  The model to be supported builds on the  experience
              of the Caltech Precollege Science Initiative (CAPSI), in  collaboration with
              school districts in Pasadena, California, Maui,  Hawaii, and Conejo Valley,
              California.  The main features of the  model are the initial creation of a
              fully transformed pilot school,  that embodies total teacher support, including
              science materials,  ongoing professional development, and frequent collegial 
              interaction with a mentoring resource teacher.  Critical to the  entire change
              effort is the partnership of the school district with  practicing scientists
              and engineers from a university, college,  industry, or the community.  During
              this project CAPSI would work  with fourteen urban school districts in
              California to bring about  similar change.    The total cost sharing of just
              Caltech and Pasadena will be 10  percent of the NSF portion of the award.  ***
