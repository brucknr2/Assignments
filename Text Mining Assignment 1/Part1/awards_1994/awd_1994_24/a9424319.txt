Abstract    :
              9424319  Lee  The purpose of this proposal is to request a block travel support 
              for participants from U.S. to attend the International Conference  on Power
              System Technology (ICPST), to be held in Beijing, China,  during October 17-21,
              1994.    China is a country with a one-fourth of the world population.  There
              is a tremendous opportunity for investment of R&D  technologies in the energy
              sector in the nation's economy.  In  this conference, heavy representation from
              Japan and European  countries is expected.  The U.S. team would benefit from
              the  interaction and information exchange in understanding the  fundamental
              issues in basic methodologies and development need  for the Chinese power
              industry, which will help to maintain  competitiveness of U.S. researchers and
              industry in the global  economy.    A request is made to supplement the travel
              cost for about twenty  four participants from U.S. universities in attending
              the  conference.  ***
