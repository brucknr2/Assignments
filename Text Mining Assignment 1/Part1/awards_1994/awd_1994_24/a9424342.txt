Abstract    :
              PI: Evans  DMS-9424342    Evans will continue his research on a variety of
              questions from nonlinear differential equations, mostly variational problems
              having geometric or physical origin.  The primary proposed new efforts include
              investigations of new PDE methods for designing optimal Monge-Kantorovich mass
              transfer schemes, flat spots on surfaces evolving under Gauss curvature flow,
              the possible regularity of "optimal" Lipschitz extensions, and time evolutions
              generated by natural quasiconvex energy functionals.    Partial differential
              equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The
              role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is
              to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions.  This
              may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In
              addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and
              estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.
