Abstract    :
              9424108  Cheng    This award provides funding for an evaluator to study the 
              industry/university interactions occurring in Northwestern  University's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for   Tribology.  The Center
              continues to meet the renewal criteria to  remain in the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Centers  Program.    The evaluator has the experience
              necessary to perform this study,  having published a number of refereed papers
              in technical journals  on the topic of industry/university cooperative research
              and its  evaluation.    The Program Manager recommends Northwestern University
              be awarded  $24,000 for 36 months.
