Abstract    :
              Chakravarthy   This project is aimed at bringing together in a conference forum
              researchers, practitioners, and students with interest in matrix-analytic
              methods for modeling stochastic systems.  The conference has multiple
              objectives.  These objectives include 1) review of the progress of research and
              the state-of-the-art in matrix analytical methods in stochastic models, 2) the
              analysis of the design of a tutorial that would allow providing a working
              knowledge of matrix-analytical methods to practitioners and students in a form
              that they can put the technique to use, 3) discuss and identify technological
              areas of application of the technique, 4) present resent unpublished research
              results, and 5) identify directions for future research.   Matrix-analytical
              method for modeling stochastic systems is a relative new area with the first
              set of systematic studies appearing in the 1980s.  Since then, a number of
              researchers in various fields such as telecommunication, production, and
              computer systems have applied it to model problems.  Despite their widespread
              areas of applications, matrix-analytical procedure is still relatively unknown
              to many potential users and researchers in the general area of stochastic
              analysis.  The conference will help to close the gap and disseminate the
              technique and its potential application to a much wider audience than has been
              so far possible.
