Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  John C. Berg  University of Washington  CTS-9424438    The Department
              of Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington proposes herein in
              acquisition of a scanning probe microscopy facility, including the capability
              of atomic force microscopy (AFM).  It would be used primarily for obtaining
              direct measurements of colloidal forces between particles and fluid interfaces
              as a function of the distance of approach, particle and interface composition,
              etc.  This is not a routine application of the instrumentation, and detailed
              measurements of this kind have not yet been reported in the literature.  They
              are nonetheless vital to ongoing investigations in the author's laboratory,
              including flotation and oil-assisted agglomeration processes for the successful
              recycling of toner-printed papers and the design of water-based coating.  The
              facility would also be used in new investigations contributing to fundamental
              understanding of the "hydrophobic interaction" and the interaction of colloid
              particles within a fluid surface.  Finally, the facility would find exhaustive
              use in the examination of solid particle and extended-surface morphology and
              composition, critical not only to much of the work in the author's laboratory,
              but also to the work of other investigators at the author's laboratory, but
              also to the work of other investigators at the author's institution.
