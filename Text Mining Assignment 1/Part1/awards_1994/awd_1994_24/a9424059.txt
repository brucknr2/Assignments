Abstract    :
              9424059  Walker       The Vassar College REU site will undertake a
              multidisciplinary  biogeochemical investigation of contaminant distribution,
              transport  and toxic effects in a small urbanized watershed in Poughkeepsie, 
              NY.  Once the magnitude and spatial distribution of contamination  has been
              assessed, specific investigations of toxicity, contaminant  transport and
              speciation will be undertaken with the ultimate goal  of creating predictive
              models of the fate and effects of  contaminants in the watershed.  Toxicity
              experiments will be  performed in controlled, benchtop settings with in situ
              monitoring  of element levels and speciation.  Transport studies will include 
              detailed field investigations of the spatial relationships of  element
              distributions, identification of important solid and  colloidal phases in both
              stream sediment and water column, and  laboratory studies of element
              partitioning between phases.  The  project will engage fourteen undergraduates
              and six high school  teachers over two years.  Participation will help both
              students and  teachers realize the importance of interdisciplinary approaches
              to  the study of environmental questions, and the advantages of a "team 
              effort" in formulating a more complete understanding of the  problem.
