Abstract    :
              9424143  Busch-Vishniac   The REU Site established at the Center for Energy
              Studies and the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Texas
              (UT) Austin will involve 36 female, African American, Hispanic, and Native
              American undergraduates in energy research over a three year period.  The
              research will be conducted over a ten week period in the summers by 11 students
              each year.  Student recruiting will be concentrated at institutions of higher
              education that have historically enrolled and graduated groups underrepresented
              in engineering.  Prairie View A&M University, University of Texas Pan American,
              Texas Southern University, Lamar University, University of Houston, and
              University of Texas El Paso will be the primary schools targeted because of the
              relationships that have been established with engineering faculty and
              professional staff at these locations.  Other campuses in the state will be
              targeted that have National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Society of
              Hispanic Professional Engineering (SHPE), or Society of Women Engineers (SWE)
              chapters.  The goal is to have at least 75% of the participants chosen to be
              from a campus other than UT Austin.  The other 25% would be chosen from the UT
              Austin campus.  Students chosen for the REU program will participate in
              state-of-the-art energy related research sponsored by industry and the federal
              government led by faculty members.  The students will meet weekly with faculty
              supervisors and bi-weekly as a group to exchange information and ides about the
              progress on their various projects.  These young engineers will be enrolled for
              three hours upper-division class credit which they can transfer back to their
              home institutions.  The summer's research activity will culminate in the
              writing and presentation of a final report summarizing the student's research
              activities.  ***
