Abstract    :
              9424385  Domaradzki  The Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University
              of  Southern California will purchase computing and visualization  equipment
              dedicated to support computational research in  engineering.  The equipment
              will be used for several research  projects, including:  subgrid-scale modeling
              based on properties of  energy transfer in turbulent flows, a computational
              investigation  of swirling jets, a study of spray dispersion in free shear
              flows,  numerical modeling of oceanographic convection in the polar  regions,
              wave interactions in weak turbulence models, and a study  of nonlinear ring
              defects and their dynamics.  ***
