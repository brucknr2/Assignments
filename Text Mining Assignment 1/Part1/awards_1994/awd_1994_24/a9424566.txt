Abstract    :
              9424566  Doak  Habitat degradation is frequently cited as one of the most
              important causes of species endangerment and extinction. Almost all plans for
              the recovery of endangered species, or any of the compromise plans that try to
              protect a species while still allowing some development emphasize population
              monitoring as a means of gauging the health of threatened populations. However,
              the ability of monitoring to measure impacts of gradual habitat degradation on
              long-term population viability has rarely been addressed. This research will
              develop source-sink models with varying levels of biological and spatial
              complexity to explore the effects of habitat degradation on short-term
              population growth and long-term viability. General models will be developed and
              explored, as well as more specific models linked to two well-studied species of
              conservation interest that face effects of habitat degradation: Yellowstone
              grizzly bears and sea otter populations in Alaska and California. Models will
              be used to investigate both the effects of habitat degradation - especially the
              existence of time lags in population responses - and the abilities of different
              monitoring strategies to detect these responses in a timely fashion. In
              addition, by fitting models of varying complexity to these systems, the level
              of model complexity and the type of field data needed to adequately detect
              responses to habitat degradation will be addressed, as well as the robustness
              of these predictions.   This research will not only give a better scientific
              understanding of the effects of habitat degradation, but will also improve the
              incorporation of monitoring data into the process of management and policy
              decision-making.
