Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert Hammer and other members of the Departments of Chemistry and  
              Biochemistry of Louisiana State University are being supported to   establish a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in   chemistry.  For the
              period 1995-97, ten non-LSU undergraduate students   will spend ten weeks each
              summer actively engaged in a variety of   research projects drawn from the
              traditional areas of chemistry and   biochemistry.   The program also includes
              activities which will improve   students' proficiency in finding chemical
              information, in written and   oral communication skills, and in knowledge of
              research and career   opportunities in the chemical sciences.  Recruitment will
              target regional   colleges and universities including predominantly minority
              institutions
