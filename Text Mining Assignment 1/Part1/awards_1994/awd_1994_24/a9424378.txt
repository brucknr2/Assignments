              Developments and an Application to Advanced Clean Coal Technology    A
              significant number of intelligent system designers favor belief  networks as
              the formalism underlying their systems' knowledge  bases.  This project uses
              belief networks as the framework for  developing formal consensus models for
              reconciling disparate  recommendations from multiple experts.  The need for
              formal  consensus models stems from the fact that decision-makers often  seek
              advice from multiple experts.  Research in belief networks  within this project
              is pursued within the context of the need for  decisions among various advanced
              clean coal technologies that  promise to reduce environmental discharges while
              simultaneously  improving coal plant efficiency and reducing operating costs. 
              So  products of this project will include both belief networks in  this
              important area and formal consensus models for belief  networks.
