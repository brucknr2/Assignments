Abstract    :
              The research program is directed toward fundamental studies  of the Raman
              amplifier.  Soliton formation, self-similar  pulses, non-orthogonal modes and
              quantum noise will be  examined with the goal of studying the universal nature
              of  these phenomena in all optical amplifiers.
