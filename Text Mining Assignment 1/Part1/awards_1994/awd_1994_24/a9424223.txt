Abstract    :
                              This award provides funds for a 10-week summer research  program
              in which undergraduate students will form research  teams to pursue research
              problems that span levels of  biological organization from the molecular to 
              population/ecological.  Although each student will have a  faculty mentor, the
              program will emphasize collaborative  effort.  Students will also participate
              in a variety of  formal and informal workshops and discussions about specific 
              research problems and about the nature of scientific  research in general.
