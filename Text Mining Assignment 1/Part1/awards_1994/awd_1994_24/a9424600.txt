Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Harold Kung    A catalytic reaction system suitable for use in a
              synchrotron X-ray beam is  constructed.  The system is to be used by the
              duPont-Norhwestern-Dow collaboration access team at the Advanced Photon Source
              (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory.  The reactor system is equipped with a
              gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer, and is serviced by a gas manifold
              capable of handling up to eight gases by remote control.  It is to be used  for
              in situ studies of catalytic reactions and structural studies of catalysts and
              catalyst precursors including vanadium-phosphorus oxides,
              transition-metal-promoted rhodium, copper-zinc oxide, supported palladium,
              microporous redox systems, and zeolites.  ***
