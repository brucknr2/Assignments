Abstract    :
              9424344  Lesniewski     It is proposed to continue and expand in new directions
              an ongoing   program of studying quantized spaces and superspaces by means of
              the   techniques of operator algebras and non-commutative differential  
              geometry. The goals of the program are:  (1) To understand the mathematics of
              quantization of systems (involving   both finitely and infinitely many degrees
              of freedom) with complicated   geometry of phase space;  (2) To study the
              non-commutative geometric principles underlying  the physics of the microworld,
              and in particular possible implications   for quantum gravity;  (3) To explore
              new mathematical phenomena relating analysis to other   fields of mathematics. 
                 Non-commutative geometry is a new direction of mathematics created  in the
              eighties. Its prime objective is to study objects, called   non-commutative
              spaces or manifolds, which are not ordinary geometric   objects but still have
              a geometric flavor. Examples of structures  of this sort arise naturally e.g.
              in physical theories of subatomic   phenomena. Methods of non-commutative
              geometry became a powerful tool   in studying various problems in modern
              analysis and understanding the   fundamentals of the physics of the microworld.
              It is proposed to   study examples of non-commutative manifolds with emphasis
              put  on applications to quantum physics. Also, it is proposed to relate   some
              of the ideas of quantum theory to problems in number theory   and modern
              analysis.  ***
