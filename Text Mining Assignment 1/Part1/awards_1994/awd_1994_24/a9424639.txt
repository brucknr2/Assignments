Abstract    :
              9424639  Gill   The objective of this research is to develop, study, and
              implement algorithms for solving large-scale, nonlinear optimization problems. 
              A large-scale optimization problem is characterized by a large number of
              variables and constraints.  Two solution approaches form the focus of the
              research.  These approaches are respectively, the interior point (barrier)
              method and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method.  The interest in
              in the interior point stems from their success on linear programming problems,
              and some interesting properties that may be of value when certain difficult
              constraints are encountered.  The interior point method can be used to
              eliminate constraints on the eigenvalues of a matrix.  On the other hand,
              interest on the use of SQP is prompted by the success of the approach on small
              and medium-sized problems, and the experiences of the investigators on the
              performance of the technique on two classes of large, practical problems that
              differ substantially in character.  If successful with these approaches, the
              developed algorithms will be coded into a software to facilitate their
              applications by practitioners.   There are several engineering, manufacturing,
              scientific, and business problems that can be described by large-scale
              nonlinear optimization models.  To date, finding a general solution algorithm
              to large scale optimization problems similar to the simplex method to linear
              programming problems has been a challenge to the optimization community.  If
              successful, the algorithms being investigated in this research could open the
              window to a better understanding of this class of optimization problems.  Many
              problems in various areas of human endeavor stand to benefit from the results
              of this work.
