Abstract    :
              9424471  Alberts  Only 60 of the 3,000 species of the extant lizards attain an
              adult body mass greater than 1 kg. Despite this, large lizards represent over
              60% of lizard species considered threatened or endangered. Even among distantly
              related species, large body size, requirements for tracts of undisturbed
              ha`itat, and human exploitation for skins and food link large lizards with
              respect to conservation management strategies. Of all large lizard species, the
              West Indian rock iguanas, genus Cyclura, are the most endangered, primarily
              because they inhabit fragile island ecosystems that suffer from habitat
              degradation and the ill effects of introduced species. Over the past two years,
              Cyclura species have been studied at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.
              This research has led to important management decisions and development of
              management plans to conserve this highly endangered lizard.   As a result of
              the recent Haitian/Cuban refugee crisis, one of the four originally proposed
              studies, the experimental reintroduction program, has been postponed. Because
              of the more than 30,000 refugees currently housed at Guantanamo Bay, field
              experiments had to be delayed. This research will take advantage of this delay
              to conduct experiments that will provide direct mechanistic evidence regarding
              species survivorship following capture breeding and release programs.    The
              release of endangered species from captive breeding programs is often conducted
              without any scientific rigor. The research in this Conservation and Restoration
              Biology proposal represents the first rigorous approach to determining the
              factors that will affect the success of captive breeding prmgrams.
