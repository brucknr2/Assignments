Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9424005  Bieber  This award will continue
              for two years the operation of a two  station array of cosmic ray neutron
              monitors in Canada which are  presently scheduled to be terminated very soon by
              the Canadian  National Research Council (NRC), which owns and operates them. 
              The  Principal Investigator, who is from Bartol Research Institute, has 
              reached an agreement with the NRC which will allow him to run them  and
              probably eventually obtain ownership.  This award gives time  for the
              arrangements for transfer to occur as well as to determine  the relative
              priority of various such facilities.  These  instruments, along with other high
              latitude monitors, are  especially important contributors to cosmic ray studies
              because  their fields of view are well defined and also because they are  much
              more sensitive to low energy cosmic rays, compared to mid-  latitude monitors.
