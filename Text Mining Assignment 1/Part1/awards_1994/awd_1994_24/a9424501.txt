Abstract    :
              9424501  Udwadi  This project will conduct  theoretical and experimental 
              studies to investigate the  effects of time delays on the  control of
              structural systems  subjected to strong earthquake  ground shaking. Both 
              collocated as well as  noncollocated control  configurations will be 
              considered. A general control  methodology and guide lines  will be developed.
              Stability  conditions for vanishingly  small gains, in the presence  of time
              delays, when actuator  and sensor are collocated,  will be found for
              (a)undamped,  (b) classically damped, and  (c)nonclassically damned  structural
              systems.  The time  delays which cause instability  for collocated feedback 
              control will be utilized  to achieve infinitesimal gains  stability for
              noncollocated  feedback control systems.  All  analytical results will be 
              applied to a simple five  degree-of-freedom system for  numerical
              verifications.    This study will help  understand the effects of  small time
              delays, which are  inevitable in the feedback  loop, on the stability of the 
              closed loop control systems.  The results will have  immediate and direct 
              application to the robust  control of a wide variety of  structural and
              mechanical  systems in dynamic  environments, especially  in the suppression of
               vibrations generated by  earthquake ground shaking.  ***
