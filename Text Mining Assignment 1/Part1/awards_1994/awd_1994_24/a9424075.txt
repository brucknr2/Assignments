Abstract    :
              9424075  Hodges   This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will
              support undergraduates to participate in research projects in the areas of
              computer graphics, virtual environments and visualization.  The goal is to
              involve junior and senior students in a long term research experience (1-2
              years) in which they make real contributions to the research, present papers at
              academic conferences, and author or co-author papers submitted to journals. 
              The research project will focus on software and algorithm development,
              experimental quantification, and application development for virtual reality
              and real-time visualization systems.  The student participants will be split
              into two groups of four each.  One group will focus on the development of
              design tools for 3-D environments, image display techniques and algorithms, and
              application of virtual reality to exposure therapy.  The other group will
              develop methods and tools for highly-interactive visualization and analysis in
              scientific applications.  The methods and tools will be both for
              workstation-based and virtual environments and will be based on a common set of
              principles.  Undergraduate participants will work in a state-of-the-art
              visualization laboratory and will meet weekly with faculty members and graduate
              students who are also involved in these projects.  ***
