Abstract    :
              9400170  Appelquist       This grant partially supports the latest in a series
              of  conferences on various topics in Physics held yearly at the  Aspen Center
              since 1985.  The one-week session in January  has as its subject Heavy Quarks,
              Heavy Leptons, and Massive  Neutrinos.  Both theoretical and experimental
              presentations  are made.  Issues discussed are of greatest current interest  in
              elementary-particle physics.  The setting provides an  opportunity for close
              interaction among theorists and  experimenters particularly hospitable to
              younger scientists.  ***
