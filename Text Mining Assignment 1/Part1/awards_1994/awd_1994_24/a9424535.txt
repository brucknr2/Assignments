Abstract    :
              9424535  Blue Granite Software, Inc.   This Small Business Innovation Research
              (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an automatic Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
              tooling generator.  The new system would allow PCB manufacturers to produce PCB
              custom tooling without manual steps.  Techniques such as statistical process
              control and continuous improvement could then be applied to the custom tooling
              portion of the PCB manufacturing process.    Complex patterns of fine lines
              must be accurately portrayed by the tooling, and these patterns are contained
              in a design database.  Creation of custom tooling from the design database is
              currently a manual process, but this system is expected to automate the
              function entirely.  If successful, the system would produce considerable cost
              savings, higher yields, and shorter response times to customer orders in the
              PCB supply industry.
