Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT      Proposal Number: CTS-9424390    P.I.:   Alec B. Scranton    
               The emission of VOCs from curing inks, films, and coatings is a leading cause
              of atmospheric pollution.  VOCs impart desirable viscosity and cure rate
              properties to ink and coating formulations.  An ink or coating formulation must
              be sufficiently fluid to be easily applied (often onto a rapidly moving
              substrate through a series of transfer rollers), but must cure rapidly to a
              hard film.  These demands have been met through the use of rapidly evaporating
              organic solvent in the ink and coating formulations.  This work investigates
              the use of cationic photopolymerization of diepoxides and bisvinyl ethers for
              such inks and coatings.  This process emits no VOCs.  This is a fundamental
              experimental and theoretical investigation of this process including developing
              detailed profiles of the reaction temperature and the extent of reaction as
              well as the physical, mechanical and thermal characterization of the final
              films.    The principal investigator is presenting the results of this research
              at a "Mr. Clean" conference at Cocoa Beach, Florida on October 18-21, 1994.
