Abstract    :
              This award supports an investigation of cosmogenic nuclide accumulation in rocks
               beneath the ice at the GISP2 site on Greenland.  Two sources of material will
              be  studied: 1) the chloritic boulder above the bedrock and 2) the
              granitic/dioritic boulder  directly below.  The overall goal of this work is to
              demonstrate the utility of cosmogenic  nuclides to dating materials beneath the
              ice sheet.  If the last ice-free period was long,  on the order of tens of
              thousands of years, the samples would have been exposed to  cosmic radiation
              long enough to accumulate measurable amounts of cosmogenic nuclides.   In this
              case, measured concentrations of these nuclides should yield information about 
              the time when the Greenland ice sheet began to build up: essentially the age of
              the  present Greenland ice sheet.  If the duration of exposure is not long,
              then only  qualitative information about the age of the ice sheet will be
              produced.  The age of the  present Greenland ice sheet is an important
              parameter for climate and ice dynamics  models as well as being an important
              constraint for models paleoenvironmental  evolution.
