Abstract    :
              The Center for Biology at the University of Wisconsin-  Madison will direct a
              summer program to provide research  opportunities to talented undergraduates in
              cell and  molecular biology in order to encourage and prepare them for 
              graduate studies.  Building on expertise gained from five  previous summer
              programs for minority undergraduates,  prospective faculty mentors and program
              staff will provide  an environment designed to foster critical thinking, 
              creative problem solving, and independent and productive  research skills. 
              Twenty-four committed faculty (22 having  mentored in previous summers) will
              lead in the planning,  implementation and evaluation of the summer program. 
              The  core the program lies in individual, independent research  experiences
              under the mentorship of faculty members with  shared research interests in cell
              and molecular biology.  Research experiences will be enhanced by a
              seminar/workshop  series to promote student-student and student faculty 
              interactions, to provide growth as independent researchers  and to prepare
              students for graduate study and career  choices.  The capstone experience will
              be a symposium in  which students formally present results to colleagues and 
              faculty.  The program will integrate multicultural and  social activities,
              which are vital for providing the  students with a productive, enjoyable and
              satisfying summer  research experience.
