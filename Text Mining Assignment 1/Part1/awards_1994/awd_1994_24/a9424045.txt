Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate  researchers
              in mathematics working under the supervision of  several faculty advisors.
              Areas of possible research include  dynamical systems, stochastic processes,
              and combinatorics. The  program  will run for eight weeks. Students will
              participate in  two seminar series and will each give a presentation. At the
              end  of the program, the students will prepare their work for   inclusion in a
              proceedings and for possible publication.
