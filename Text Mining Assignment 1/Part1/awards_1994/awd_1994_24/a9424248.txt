Abstract    :
              9424248  COBURN    This project will provide support for shipboard scientific   
              support equipment for the research vessels ATLANTIS II, KNORR and  OCEANUS,
              operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,    and dedicated to use
              in support of ocean science research.        The Shipboard Scientific Support
              Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the
              proper and safe    conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides
              support  for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the 
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational  equipment
              such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite    receivers to pin point the
              location of research sites,    communication equipment including radio
              transceivers and    satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data   
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for
              transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.        The Project
              Director, Joseph L. Coburn is fully qualified to    direct this project having
              had considerable experience in    overseeing similar activities.        This
              project will allow the institution to obtain a hydro block,  emergency
              breathing devices and exercise equipment for the OCEANUS,  and a P-Code GPS
              receiver and computer for the KNORR.  ***
