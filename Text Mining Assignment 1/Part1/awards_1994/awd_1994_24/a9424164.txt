Abstract    :
                 This RUI project  is a companion project to the RUI project CCR-9503601 (PI:
              Belanger) of Northeast  Missouri State University.    (1) The first part of
              this research project aims to  better understand  the properties and structures
              of average-case NP-complete  problems under randomizing reductions. 
              Randomizing reducibility  is a powerful  tool used to learn about average-case
              completeness.  In particular, the  existence of isomorphisms between complete 
              problems and the structure of  complete problems under randomizing  reductions
              are studied.  Polynomial  isomorphisms are explored in  the setting of
              randomizing many-to-one reductions  based on recent  results on the
              NP-isomorphism problem with respect to random  instances, which have explicit
              support for this goal.   (2) The second research  topic is rankable
              distributions.  P-rankable  distributions were proposed  recently to capture
              the ranking of  probability distributions, but they are not  directly
              comparable  to p-time computable distributions used in the literature.  The 
              goal here is to investigate whether p-rankable distributions can  provide 
              harder instances than p-time computable distributions for  randomized NP 
              decision problems and randomized NP search  problems.
