Abstract    :
              9424317  Kwei  The primary objective of the research is to elucidate the 
              influence of substituent groups on the solubility, gelation,  formation of
              staaked layer structure, side-chain  crystallization, and miscibility of rigid
              polymers.  Side  chain substitution of rigid polymers to improve solubility  is
              now a well-established strategy.  Past work on sulfonated  poly(p-phenylene
              terephthalamide) resulted in a polymer  which was soluble in many solvents. 
              The solutions, however,  turned into gels upon standing.  The birefringent gels
               showed nematic liquid crystalline structures and were  thermoreversible.  The
              polymer showed potential as a solid  polymer electrolyte for high-energy
              battery applications.  When crosslinked, the mechanochemical response to
              electrical  field stimulation was similar to the responses of flexible 
              polyelectrolyte gels.  %%%  The study consists of four parts.  The first part
              is  concerned with the kinetics of aggregation of sulfonated  aromatic
              polyamide in solution and the subsequent  transformation of the solution into a
              gel.  Dynamic light  scattering measurements will be used to monitor the 
              aggregation phenomenon.  In the second part,  the study on  metal-ion
              conducting solid-polymer polyelectrolytes and  electric-field stimulation will
              be continued.  The third  part of the study includes substituted
              poly(p-phenylenes)  having novel structures and molecular composites derived 
              from these polymers.  Investigation of  side chain  crystallization and stacked
              layer structures is an important  aspect of the work.  The fourth part of the
              study involves  the synthesis of substituted cellulose to test whether semi 
              flexible main chains having long alkyl side groups can self  assemble into
              stacked layer structures.  ***
