Abstract    :
              This three-year award supports research on the non-perturbative modeling of the
              quantum  gravitational back-reaction on inflation between Richard P. Woodard of
              the University of Florida, and  Nicholas C. Tsamis of the Foundation for
              Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH) in Greece.  The  objective of their
              research is to develop a non-perturbative technique by modeling the infrared
              sector  of quantum gravity numerically and then evolving the universe through
              the extinction of inflation.  The investigators have used the symbolic
              manipulation program Mathematica, which is supported at both  FORTH and the
              University of Florida, in their analysis of the perturbative problem.  This
              jointly  supported facility will also enable their current research.  If the
              investigators' analysis is  successful, it may be possible eventually to
              predict the reheating temperature, the spectrum and  magnitude of density
              fluctuations, for the universe's response to the electroweak and chiral
              symmetry  breaking phase transitions, and for whatever residual inflationary
              effect is currently being  experienced.
