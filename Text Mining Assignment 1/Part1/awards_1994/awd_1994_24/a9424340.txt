Abstract    :
              This is a program to stimulate and encourage the scientific  development of
              young researchers by enabling them spend a summer  together in Madison,
              Wisconsin in day-to-day interaction with  senior researchers from  the
              University of Wisconsin as well as  with senior visitors.  Participants will
              benefit from access to  the major research library and other research
              facilities at the  University, opportunities to establish continuing contacts
              and   collaboration with the other participants in the program, and  advice and
              support in developing long term research programs.
