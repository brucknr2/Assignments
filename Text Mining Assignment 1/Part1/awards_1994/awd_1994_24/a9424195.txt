Abstract    :
              9424195  Guckenheimer   Under this three-year program, undergraduate students
              will investigate problems in a variety of areas of computational science
              research under the joint guidance of Cornell University faculty member and
              members of the Corand technical staff. While working on their research
              projects, students will not only participate in scientific research but will
              also learn about computational methods and receive training in high performance
              computing techniques.  The research projects will take advantage of the
              advanced computational resources of the Theory Center including scaleable
              parallel processing and visualization tools.    The research experience will be
              enhanced by the interaction among students from diverse institutions with
              multi-disciplinary backgrounds and research projects.  Building on
              long-standing relationships, the project will aggressively recruit from
              historically black colleges and women's colleges; it will also target those
              institutions which lack a strong research orientation.  Students at colleges
              and universities with otherwise limited computational research resources will
              thus have the opportunity to undertake significant reseapch projects as part of
              their undergraduate education.  ***
