Abstract    :
              9424532  Gourse  The 1995 FASEB Summer Conference on "Transcription Initiation
              in Prokaryotes" will be held July 15-20, 1995 at the Vermont Academy in
              Saxton's River, Vermont. The conference is held under the auspices of the
              Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). There will
              be ten major sessions and poster sessions. The topics to be included for
              discussion are: biochemistry of transcription, control through different
              sigmas, activation, repression, promoter recognition, and control of
              transcription in complex systems. The purpose of the meeting is to bring
              together geneticists and biochemists to share information. The field of
              transcription initiation in prokaryotes is progressing rapidly, providing
              information on mechanisms at the molecular level.This is the third FASEB Summer
              Conference on this subject. The first two, in 1991 and 1993, were well
              attended.  %%%  Transcription, the synthesis of RNA molecules from DNA
              templates, is the first step in the expression of genes, a process fundamental 
               to life.  During this meeting researchers seeking to understand transcription
              at the molecular level through the study of bacteria will exchange ideas and
              information.  Such understanding has the potential to greatly benefit mankind.
