Abstract    :
              9424214  Shah   This project represents a continuation of a Research Experience
              for Undergraduates site which has operated successfully for the past seven
              years.  Over sixty undergraduate students from a half dozen institutions in
              Florida have participate in this program.  The key distinctive elements of the
              approach at this institution are (1) to have a full calendar year experience
              planned for the participants, so that they have time to follow a substantial
              project of their own through to completion, (2) to present each participant
              with several possible project to topics, so that they can feel they have chosen
              a project which is most interesting to them, (3) to immerse the participants in
              the general research environment almost as if they were graduate students, by
              having them meet with the faculty member once each week to discuss their
              project, participate in the weekly research group meetings, attend research
              presentations and meet with visiting researchers, and (4) to follow through
              over the year by working with the students to write a technical report on their
              project, to study for the GRE's and to apply to graduate programs.  In past
              years, a large fraction of the participants in this program have been able to
              prepare a paper for submission to a conference, have the paper accepted and
              then attend the conference to present the paper.  Several past participants
              have even accomplished substantial enough research to also result in journal
              publications.  Many of the past participants are now pursuing graduate studies
              at various institutions.  ***
