Abstract    :
              9424452  Bertsch       We propose to organize an annual summer school in 
              nuclear physics research, continuing the National Summer  School in Nuclear
              Physics held annually since 1988.  The  school would bring together leading
              researchers to lecture  on their specialties to advanced graduate students in 
              experimental and theoretical nuclear physics.  The overall  goal of the schools
              is to provide students with a reference  frame for defining critical problems
              of nuclear physics and  the most useful methods of analysis of the problems. 
              This  addresses one weakness in the current nuclear research  environment,
              which is the relative isolation of university-  based nuclear research groups. 
              We also expect that the  close contact with leading researchers will be
              beneficial in  increasing the number of students going on to productive 
              research careers.  ***
