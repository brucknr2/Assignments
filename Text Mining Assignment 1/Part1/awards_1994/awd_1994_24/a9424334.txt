Abstract    :
              This project consists of the development of a scanning fiber  optic spectrometer
              for use aboard a U.S. Navy submarine, and  the analysis of water samples
              obtained in various parts of  the Arctic Ocean in order to determine dispersion
              processes  of river-borne trace elements and pollutants.    Prior results,
              using conservative tracers, have provided  some integrated measures of riverine
              influence, but the  spatial coverage has not been sufficient to delineate the 
              pathways of freshwater inputs.  Furthermore the tracers that  have been used,
              such as alkalinity, calcium, and oxygen  isotopes, cannot be used to
              distinguish among different  river sources.  This project will extend the suite
              of  available tracers to include humic acid and minor  constituents such as
              manganese, barium, rubidium, strontium,  bromine, and iodine.  Manganese is a
              particularly useful  tracer since its concentration in river water is typically
               two orders of magnitude greater than its open ocean value,  and this
              concentration is sensitive to river chemistry and  environmental conditions. 
              Dissolved manganese can therefore  be expected to help provide a particular
              river signature,  and provide information on the dispersion characteristics of 
              a given river plume.  ***
