Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for six undergraduate  researchers in
              mathematics and engineering. Research will be on  inverse problems in
              mathematics with applications in engineering.  The program will run for eight
              weeks. Students will also attend a  special seminar dealing with technical
              writing and scientific  presentations.
