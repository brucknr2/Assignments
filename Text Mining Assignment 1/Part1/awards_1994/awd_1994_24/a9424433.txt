Abstract    :
              9424433  Garstang         This award will continue the "Characterization of
              Aerosols  over Southern Africa (C-CASA)" which is directed solely at the 
              analysis of the field generated data gathered under CASA and the  larger
              umbrella experiments of SAFARI-TRACE-A conducted in southern  Africa, the
              southern tropical Atlantic and Brazil in September-  October 1992.       The
              objective of C-CASA is to determine the characteristics of  aerosols
              originating over the savannas of southern Africa.  The  overall objectives are
              now refined and expended on given the  knowledge of what was achieved in the
              field.  Chemical and isotopic  composition of surface and airborne samples will
              be completed.    Aerosol mass as well as elemental concentrations over
              continental  source regions and in downstream regions of transports will be 
              determined.  Isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen together with changes  in
              concentrations of elements in the aerosol samples will be  combined with
              kinematic (trajectory) and thermodynamic (atmospheric  conservative properties
              and stability) to determine 4-D (x,y,z,t)  transports.  Transports will be
              traced to the source locations in  a horizontal framework ranging from regional
              to continental scales  and in a lagrangian coordinate system following the
              trajectory as  a function of height.
