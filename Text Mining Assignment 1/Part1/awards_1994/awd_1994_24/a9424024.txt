Abstract    :
              9424024  Heller  A new "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" Site will be 
              initiated in the Physics Department of the University of  Minnesota. 
              Recruitment will be conducted nationally, with a  special emphasis on women and
              minority students.  The Site  will provide consequential involvement in
              research in a  number of areas of physics.  There will be a number of 
              professional events organized for the participants.  ***
