Abstract    :
              9424209  Straka        The Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program is
              designed to attract  talented students into research careers.  Under this Site
              Grant, the Principal  Investigators will provide support for twelve
              undergraduate students in late  spring/early Summer of 1995 to work with
              meteorological mentors at various  university, state and governmental 
              meteorological orgalizations and to participate in  the Verification of Origins
              of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment.        Field work and research will be
              supplemented by tours and lectures to produce  a well-rounded experience that
              will provide the students an opportunity to become  aware of scientific
              research careers.  A previous grant using a similar format proved  to be quite
              successful.  A new feature in the current award, however, is proposed 
              cooperation with a historically black university building upon an existing
              internship  program originally established by the National Oceanic Atmospheric
              Administration  and Clark Atlanta University.  ***
