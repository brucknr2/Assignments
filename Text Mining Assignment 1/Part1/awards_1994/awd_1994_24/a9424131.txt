Abstract    :
              9424131  Parpia  This  project  explores  the effect of impurities  that  are 
              one  dimensional (strands of aerogel) or zero dimensional (4He  atoms)  on  the
              superfluidity of 3He. The presence of impurities modifies  the  phase  diagram 
              of  pure 3He in ways that  are  incompletely  understood  and  are often
              surprising. The research  will  employ  both  pure  3He  and  mixtures of 3He
              and  4He.  Of  considerable  interest  is  the  distribution of 3He and the 4He
               in  mixtures:  Phase   separation   may  occur,  one  of  the   isotopes  
              being  preferentially adsorbed near the aerogel colloid, the  superfluid 
              properties  of  the  system may be changed,  etc.  There  is  the  possibility 
              that the work could lead to discovery of  conditions  in  which two different
              superfluids coexist in a mixture  of  3He  and  4He.  The  work  will use
              torsional  oscillators  and  sound  resonators   to   map  the  transition 
              temperature,   superfluid  fraction,  sound  velocity  and heat capacity  of 
              these  quantum  fluids  in aerogels. The research is of a fundamental nature 
              and  will   provide  important  information  about  the   physics   of 
              superfluid behavior.  %%%  This  is  an  experimental low temperature physics 
              project.  The  research deals with superfluid liquids consisting of the
              isotopes  of  helium:  helium-3, helium-4, or mixtures thereof. Separately, 
              helium-3  or  helium-4  can be cooled  to  the  superfluid  state  (vanishing 
              viscosity).  Very recently, it  was  discovered  that  mixtures   of   helium-3
               and  helium-4   can   have   properties  surprisingly different from the
              parent superfluids.  Further,  it  has  been  found  that the presence of a
              filamentary  aerogel  (a  silica-gel) "impurity" colloid, which comprises only 
              1%  of  the  sample volume, can profoundly affect the superfluid properties of 
              the  isotope  mixtures. The effect is related to the  very  large  surface  
              area  of  the  aerogel.  A  range  of  low  temperature  techniques  are  being
              employed to investig ate these  fundamental  problems,  which bear of the
              physics of superfluids. The  results  may  also  be  relevant  to  other 
              quantum  phenomena  such   as  superconductivity.  ***
