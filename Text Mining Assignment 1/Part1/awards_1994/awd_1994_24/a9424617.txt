Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9424617  Gollahalli      This proposal is for funds for the
              partial purchase of a pulsed Nd/Yag Laser System (including an Optical
              Parametric Amplifier and Frequency Doubler).  The equipment will be used to
              develop a Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) Imaging System capability in
              order to visualize and monitor NO and OH in turbulent diffusion flames from
              non-circular burners, and in buoyant and weakly-buoyant nonsooting diffusion
              flames.  Future use of the equipment for Mie and Rayleigh/Raman scattering
              measurements is also anticipated.
