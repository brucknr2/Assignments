Abstract    :
              This is a renewal grant from a group of condensed matter theorists who are
              applying  advanced theoretical techniques to investigate condensed matter
              systems with strongly coupled degrees  of freedom.  The following areas will be
              studied:  quantum Hall and other strongly correlated Fermi  systems; 
              superfluids and crystalline liquids;  amorphous macromolecular and related
              vitreous  materials; and mesoscopic Luttinger and superconducting systems. %%%
              This theoretical research deals  with a wide variety of problems relating to
              condensed matter physics and materials research.  The work  will use
              state-of-the-art techniques to contribute to research ranging from a
              microscopic model of  rubber to the behavior of ultra-small electronic
              structures.  The work will contribute to basic  condensed matter physics and to
              the understanding of real materials.
