Abstract    :
              9424649  Grandhi   In this research, a novel scheme for integrated design of
              preform die shapes and process conditions for difficult-to-forge components
              will be developed.  Industry provided design goals and performance requirements
              will be taken in formulating the die shape design procedures.  The novelty lies
              in the combined use of multi-objective die shape evolution and process control
              design optimization procedures along with viscoplastic finite element analysis.
               The design scheme makes use of the relationships of microstructure and field
              variables, finite element modeling, and shape optimization approaches.  The
              deformation energy, variance of strain-rate and temperature distributions in
              the workpiece are used as multiple-objectives to control the processing of high
              temperature materials.  This approach takes into account the nonlinear material
              behavior and a constantly changing boundary value problem by using an automated
              process parameter design at critical steps of deformation.  The optimized
              designs will be experimentally validated at two industrial sites, one
              representing aerospace and the other heavy machinery parts.  As a result of two
              collaborating industries, material selection will include "exotic" titanium
              aluminide as well as "high volume" steel.     Successful demonstration of this
              research is expected to have a positive impact in terms of cost and quality of
              forging, especially for intricate designs and hard to process materials.  With
              a manufacturing "pull" from the industrial partners, the research results are
              likely to be implemented rapidly.  ***
