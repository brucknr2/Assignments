Abstract    :
                This research seeks to improve the accuracy of  methods to solve some
              particular eigenvalue problems.    The   first is the  classical symmetric
              eigenvalue problem.  Recent results have   shown that there is  a large class
              of  symmetric eigenvalue problems for which   small structured  perturbations
              result in small changes in the eigenvalues in    the relative sense.  This
              class of matrices is called ``well-behaved''.  The   problem of finding a 
              necessary and sufficient  condition for a matrix to be   ``well-behaved'' is
              being  investigated.        A number of related issues have to be   considered,
              including: analysis of methods for updating  indefinite eigenvalue  problems;
              investigation of methods for   updating the ULV and  ULLV approximations to the
              singular   value decomposition and generalized singular value   decomposition;
              and development of analysis of methods  for computing the sparse  generalized
              singular value   decomposition.    The last  two issues are extremely important
              in the solution  of   ill-posed least squares  problems and total least squares
               problems.  The implications   of derived results  for these  problems are
              being investigated.
