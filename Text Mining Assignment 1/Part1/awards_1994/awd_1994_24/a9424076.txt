Abstract    :
              This award supports summer research by undergraduates at the  University of
              Kansas department of Biochemistry.  Students  pursue research related to
              ongoing faculty research  programs,  including collaborative efforts in
              classical  structure analysis of proteins, genetic engineering and  physical
              biochemical approaches to understanding the  structure, function and regulation
              of enzymes and of  membrane proteins.  Students will participate in various 
              group activities, including seminars and journal clubs, in  addition to
              individual research.
