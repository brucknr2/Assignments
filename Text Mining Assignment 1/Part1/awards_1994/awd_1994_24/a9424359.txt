Abstract    :
              This award supports the continuing research of Jason Rush at the  University of
              Washington. In prior work, Rush introduced a family  of metrics, the use of
              which has led to improvement of the  Minkowski-Hlawka lower bounds on lattice
              packing density for  various families of bodies in Euclidean n-space. In this
              project,  he will continue the study of properties of these metrics and  their
              application to problems of constructing dense lattice  packings for additional
              types of geometric bodies, to multiple  packing and covering, and to the
              construction of error-correcting  codes.     This research is in the field of 
              the geometry of numbers. The  geometry of numbers is a blending of number
              theory - the study of  properties of the whole numbers - and the geometry of
              variously  shaped bodies in Euclidean n-space. An example of a fundamental 
              problem in this field is the determination of what configuration  of spheres in
              Euclidean n-space will contain the maximum possible  volume. Such sphere
              packings are closely related to efficient  error-correcting codes, such as
              those used to store data on  compact discs, and also have applications to
              problems in  information transmission which occur for example in the 
              construction of modems.
