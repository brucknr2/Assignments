Abstract    :
              9424216  Yen  This  experimental  project  studies  of  the  optical  properties
               of  luminescent materials with emphasis on the dynamical properties of the 
              optically  excited  states; these properties arise  from  interactions  between
              the active centers and with the elementary excitations of  the  solid. New
              optically active materials will be synthesized, engineered,  and  characterized
              through the Laser Heated Pedestal Growth method  in  which  non-linear  optical
               processes  can  be  accurately  controlled  through  compositional  changes 
              in the  samples.   In  addition,  the  dynamical  processes  of excited states
              induced by  narrow  band  non-  equilibrium  phonons  and  magnons  in  ordered
               materials   will   be  investigated.   These  studies  will  provide  better 
              insights   into  relaxation and transport properties in solids.  %%%  Studies
              of the optical spectroscopic properties of materials which are  luminescent  or
              emit light are being carried out. The materials  being  studied  are employed
              in a wide variety of communications and  display  technologies. The project
              involves methods whereby new materials  with  better properties can be
              synthesized and improved as a result of their  optical  characterization.   In
              order to  improve  these  materials  a  fundamental  understanding  of  the
              interactions  between  the  atomic  centers responsible for emitting light and
              their surroundings  in  the  solid  host  must  be  arrived  at;  these 
              processes  often  lead  to  dissipation and relaxation of the optically excited
              atomic  state  and  need  to  be suppressed to improve material efficiencies. 
              The optical  studies proposed here are expected to provide basic insights on 
              these  interactions.  ***
