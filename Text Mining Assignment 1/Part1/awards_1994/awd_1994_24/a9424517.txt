Abstract    :
              9424517  Webster        This U.S.-Brazil Program award will fund a planning
              visit by  Dr. Grady L. Webster of the University of California, Davis  to
              discuss collaboration on systematics of Euphorbiaceae  with botanists in
              Brazil.  Dr. Webster is linking this visit  to the XLVI Congresso Nacional de
              Botanica in Riberao Preto,  Sao Paulo, Brazil.  He will stay on to meet with
              colleagues  at Instituto Botanico in Sao Paulo and at Museu Municipal in 
              Curitiba.  An informal conference will be held to discuss  collaboration in
              preparing a systematic treatment of the  Euphorbiaceae of Brasil, as a possible
              precursor to a new  Flora Brasiliensis that will include all vascular plant 
              families.  The 60 genera with c. 900 species of Brasilian  Euphorbiaceae
              include species of biogegraphic and  evolutionary interest, and the wild forms
              of important  economic plants such as Hevea (rubber) and Manihot  (cassava).
