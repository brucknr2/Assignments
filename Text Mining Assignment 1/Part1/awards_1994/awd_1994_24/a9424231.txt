Abstract    :
              9424231  Hagan   The REU Site in the Center for Research and Education in Optics
              and Lasers (CREOL) will expose ten undergraduate students per year, recruited
              nationally, to twelve weeks of research experiences in lasers and optics.  A
              primary emphasis of these programs will be on encouraging talented
              undergraduate students, in particular women, minorities and persons with
              disabilities, to pursue graduate studies in the field of optics and lasers. 
              Ten internationally recognized faculty in the CREOL will be Research
              Supervisors in this project.  CREOL is a world-leading center of excellence in
              optics and laser research.  The program will include:  (1) An introductory
              course in the basic principals of optics and lasers; (2) Weekly Undergraduate
              Research Seminars by the CREOL Faculty; (3) Bi-weekly industrial visits to the
              numerous optics and laser companies in the Orlando area; (4) Weekly classes and
              discussions sessions on issues of ethics in engineering research, research
              group tutorials; and (5) Continuous monitoring of the students' progress by the
              principal investigators, primarily via twice-weekly tutorial discussion
              sessions.  The program will be followed up by helping students get into
              graduate school with scholarships and by tracking their career progress.  ***
