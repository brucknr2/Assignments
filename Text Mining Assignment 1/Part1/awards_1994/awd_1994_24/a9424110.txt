Abstract    :
              9424110  Cotter       Ten women will undertake field and laboratory research to 
              determine the origin of glacial and postglacial deposits in west-  central
              Minnesota.  The students will work on related projects  using till analysis to
              determine the origin and glacial history of  three problematic deposits. 
              Additionally, paleoenvironmental  studies of lacustrine deposits will be
              expanded to include  micropaleontological, palynological and geochemical
              investigations.  A field trip to the Canadian Rockies will illustrate active
              glacial  processes.  The culmination of the program, the "Friends of UMM  REU"
              conference, provides the opportunity for the women to present  results and
              discuss ideas with experts in the field.  Facilities at  UMM offer the
              opportunity to develop collegial ties with other  undergraduate researchers,
              and to serve as mentors, instructors,  and role models for underrepresented
              high school students involved  in the research projects.  The unique
              opportunity to work in a  scientific community where underrepresented groups
              constitute a  majority will break down traditional barriers and aid in
              maturation  of the students as scientists.
