Abstract    :
              9424370  Akemann      Unbounded derivations of operator algebras have been
              studied   extensively as a model for the infinitesimal time development of a  
              quantum-mechanical system.  The proposed research involves a study of  
              unbounded derivations of von Neumann algebras building on Weaver's  
              characterization of the domains of such derivations as Lipschitz   algebras, in
              the commutative case.      Operators on a Hilbert space are infinite analogues
              of finite   matrices. They have applications throughout mathematics but the
              proposed   research relates specifically to mathematical physics.  Algebras of 
               operators have been used to model certain quantum mechanical systems,  
              particularly those arising in quantum statistical mechanics.  The   proposal
              involves a change of the type of operator algebra used in this   manner, with
              the double aim of clarifying the general theory and giving   insight into
              specific examples.  ***
