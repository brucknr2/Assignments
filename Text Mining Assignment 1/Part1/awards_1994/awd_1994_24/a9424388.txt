Abstract    :
              Abstract    This award is for support for a one year project to analyze dust 
              samples from the GISP2 ice core to yield information on their  possible
              continental source areas.  The investigators seek to  analyze samples from
              several climatic periods (pre-Holocene to  present) representing both warm and
              cold climate extremes.  The  mineralogy and isotopic composition of the dust
              will be studied  in order to aid in constraining models of paleo-atmospheric 
              circulation and dust transport.  This study continues, for an  additional year,
              work begun in a pilot project (OPP-9321910) on  the same project.
