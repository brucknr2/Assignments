Abstract    :
              CTS-9424392  Przybycien  RPI      A Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
              spectrometer will be acquired and used for several projects dealing with
              interactions of proteins with surfaces.  The projects dealing with interactions
              of proteins with surfaces.  The projects include membrane separations,
              biofouling, chromatography and drug-delivery systems.  In particular, the
              equipment will provide information on the surface properties of bulk materials
              including films and particulates, the surface chemistry of coatings and
              polymeric materials, and the behavior of adsorbed macromolecules such as
              proteins and polysaccharides.  Additional projects involve sol-gel surfaces and
              combustion products.  The equipment will benefit a variety of on-going projects
              related to biotechnology.
