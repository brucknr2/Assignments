Abstract    :
              9424201  Emanuel       Dr. Emanuel will continue to investigate several aspects
              of the reasons for the  development and evolution of tropical cyclones.  The
              first part of the research effort will be to  complete the analyses of data
              taken during the Tropical Experiment in Mexico (TEXMEX).   When completed, the
              development of four hurricanes will have been analyzed from the data and 
              simple numerical simulations of the cases completed to test the physical
              hypotheses formed to  explain the observations.  In a separate investigation,
              the PI will test his hypothesis that spiral  bands in hurricanes are squall
              lines whose orientation with respect to the hurricane's vertical  shear at each
              point is determined by the interaction of the mean shear with the dynamics of
              the  cold pool of air found near the surface in hurricanes.  This will be
              tested using a three-  dimensional ensemble model.  Finally, the PI will begin
              a study on the concentric eyewalls that  are observed in hurricanes, seeking
              through numerical studies to test his hypothesis that the  cycles of the
              eyewalls are a form of wind-induced surface heat exchange instability of the
              mature  hurricane circulation.  All of these efforts are important in improving
              our understanding of the  behavior of tropical cyclones.         This award is
              jointly supported by the Mesoscale and Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology 
              Programs.  ***
