Abstract    :
              DMS-9424613  PI: Margulis    Margulis will investigate the dynamics of subgroup
              actions on homogeneous spaces with applications to number theory, properly
              discontinuous groups acting on homogeneous spaces, rigidity questions and
              related problems in geometry and ergodic theory, and geometric aspects of
              reduction theory.      The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
              Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
              symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has
              had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and
              number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
              elementary particle physics.
