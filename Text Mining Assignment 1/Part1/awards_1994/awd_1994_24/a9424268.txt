Abstract    :
              9424268  Rasdorf   This REU Site will support three years a research program in
              civil engineering.  One important objective of the proposed program is to
              understand the underlying mechanisms necessary to increase the number of women
              pursuing advanced degrees in engineering and qualifying for academic and
              research careers.  In brief, this program is divided into three parts.  The
              main focus of the program will provide 10 full fellowships each summer for
              three years for engineering students.  The program will pay each students a
              stipend plus housing costs.  Furthermore, we will guarantee at least 80%
              participation by women in this program.  In addition, we will pursue a second
              focus devoted to creating guidelines for faculty and principal investigators
              which will explain how to effectively conduct an undergraduate research program
              and interact with undergraduate students.  A brochure for students that answers
              some of their commonly held questions about graduate school and research
              careers will also be developed and widely distributed.  Additionally, two
              surveys - one for participating faculty and the other for participating
              students - will be developed as a means for evaluating our program.  In
              summary, not only will we supervise students, but we will also develop
              brochures, guidelines, and surveys that we believe will be broadly useful to
              interested faculty and students.  ***
