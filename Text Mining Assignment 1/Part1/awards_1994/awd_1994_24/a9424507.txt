Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9424507  PARKER  MINNESOTA    This research deals with three
              problems involving the relation between sediment transport and stream
              morphology.  The first consists of the pursuit of a morphologic bedload
              relation for gravel-bed rivers dominated by alternate bars.  A combination of
              numerical, experimental and field work will be used to move from a local
              relation for gravel transport to a global one that inherently includes that bar
              structure.  The second is concerned with the formation of fluvially-dominated
              alluvial fans.  Here theory and experiment are to combined to obtain a
              mechanistic, predictive model of alluvial fan structure and evolution from
              considerations of the individual distributary channels.  The work will be
              augmented by avaiable field data.  The third topic is cyclic steps.  This
              newly-recognized bedform headcuts and chute-and-pool topography.  Experiments
              will be combined with theory for a complete explanation of the form in
              question.
