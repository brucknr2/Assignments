Abstract    :
              Smale       The investigator studies algorithms based on Newton's method  for
              finding zeros of a system of polynomials.  The focus of the  analysis is to
              obtain bounds on the number of Newton steps  required.  Such bounds will depend
              on the number of variables, the  degrees of the polynomials, and the desired
              accuracy.       The goal of the project is a complexity theory of nonlinear 
              equation solving.  Equation solving is at the heart of much of  mathematics and
              the main theoretical problem associated to its  modern theory of computation is
              its complexity theory.  Equation  solving, together with its computational
              aspects, is a main way  that mathematics is used by engineering, physics,
              economics, and  many other disciplines.
