Abstract    :
              9424596   Duenyas   The objective of this research is the development of
              analytical models that will assist the marketing and manufacturing departments
              of a manufacturing organization in the way new customer orders are accepted and
              how the due dates of the new orders can be set by marketing such that the
              manufacturing department can deliver the orders on the promised due date and
              conditions.  Furthermore, the research is also aimed at developing order
              release and job sequencing methodologies that would help manufacturing realize
              the promised order due dates.  Due date setting will take into account the
              workload level in the shop.    This research addresses a very critical problem
              and one that has been the source of many conflicts between the marketing and
              the manufacturing departments of many manufacturing companies.  To ensure
              sales, marketing may accept and promise order delivery dates that manufacturing
              finds difficult to realize.  The output of this research will assist in
              alleviating the conflict.  Furthermore, the problem addressed is real and one
              that does not have a systematic procedure for resolution.  If successful, the
              outcome of this research will pave the way to a more amicable relationship
              between marketing and manufacturing.
