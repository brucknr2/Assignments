Abstract    :
              This award supports summer research by undergraduates at the  Department of
              Biochemistry of the Michigan State University.  Students,  most of whom will be
              recruited from other  institutions in the midwest, will pursue research related
              to  ongoing research programs of 23 faculty members.  Students  will also
              attend weekly faculty research seminars and  participate in weekly
              presentations by students and  postdocs.  Students will be expected to present
              the results  of their 12 projects in written and oral communications.
