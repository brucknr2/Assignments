Abstract    :
              9424569  Busch-Vishniac   This project will use a new six degree of freedom
              sensor based on lateral effect silicon photo sensitive diode (PSD) technology,
              to measure dimensions on manufactured mechanical components.  For a high volume
              production environment, the innovation is in meeting the technical performance
              specifications.  Resolutions on the order of 0.01-0.l  micrometer over a linear
              range of +/- 30 mm and angular resolutions on the order of 0.01 arc-seconds
              over a rotation range of  +/- 2 degrees are possible, and because these are
              primarily analog sensors, the goal is to make 1000 measurements a second so
              that it is feasible to use them for feedback process control in high volume
              production.  This project will address three topics of importance in achieving
              these technical goals relevant to manufacturing: an error analysis of the
              integrated sensor system, implementation and robustness issues when installed
              in a manufacturing environment, and detection of dimensions, as well as
              position, of a fabricated part.  To test the robustness issues, the
              investigators will work with a company to develop and install a prototype
              system in a pilot manufacturing environment.   Successful completion of this
              project will provide a new resolution, high speed, non-contact sensor
              technology at modest cost.  This enables closed loop control of dimensional or
              mechanical features in manufacturing and assembly systems that produce high
              volume and high quality products and components.
