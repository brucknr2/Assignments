Abstract    :
              This award funds summer participation by undergraduates in  ongoing faculty
              research in the Department of Biology at  Carnegie-Mellon University.  The
              Department conducts  nationally recognized research in cell biology, genetics, 
              molecular biology, developmental biology, biochemistry and  biophysics.  Each
              student will carry out an original  research project devised by a faculty
              member who is a leader  in his or her area of expertise.  Students will also
              attend  a special seminar series and workshops ranging from honor in  science
              to applying to graduate school, and present the  results of their research at a
              concluding symposium.  Students will be recruited from colleges and
              universities  all over the United States.  Special efforts will be made to 
              recruit students from liberal arts colleges and the  recruitment of a
              significant number of minority students and  women is a major goal.  Selection
              of students will be based  upon academic criteria (SAT scores), letters of 
              recommendation, as well as the students' stated interest in  research.
