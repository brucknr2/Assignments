Abstract    :
              9424419    Sokol    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project introduces the application of concurrent engineering methods to the
              materials industry.  Discrete product manufacturers have utilized
              computer-based tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), but materials
              suppliers perform the materials product design function relying on the
              traditional paper-based approach for documentation and communication.    SBIR
              Phase I research produced a conceptual design and a specification definition
              language for capturing materials specifications in a structured electronic
              format.  Phase II is expected to validate the design of a concurrent
              engineering design software system and extend the scope of application to
              forging and casting design activities.    A complete working prototype will be
              developed in coordination with two industrial partners and with the subcontract
              support of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the Edison Materials
              Technology Center of Kettering, OH.    A significant commercial potential for
              this software rests in large cost savings and quality improvements made
              possible through new applications of concurrent engineering design techniques
              in materials and related industries.
