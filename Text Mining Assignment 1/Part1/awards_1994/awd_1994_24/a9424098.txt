Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate  researchers in
              mathematics. The research at this site will come  from some of the areas of
              probability, operations research,  number theory, partial differential
              equations, and dynamics. The   program will run for two months. There will be
              seminars twice  each week in which the students will present their work.
              Outside  visitors will also be asked to participate.
