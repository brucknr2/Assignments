Abstract    :
              This grant supplies funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V ALPHA HELIX,
              a 133 foot vessel, which is owned by the NSF and operated by the University. 
              Instrumentation requested includes computer hardware, a transmissometer,
              temperature sensors, a thermosalinograph, Niskin bottles, a flow-through
              fluorometer, a pure water source, and an altimeter.  The requested
              instrumentation is necessary to support NSF funded cruises in 1995 and will
              enhance the scientific capabilities of the vessel in the future.    ??
