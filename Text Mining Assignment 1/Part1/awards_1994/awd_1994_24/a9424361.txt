Abstract    :
              This study will investigate radar techniques and low-latitude ionospheric
              instability and drift  processes using the Jicamarca Radio Observatory in Peru.
               The studies will focus on the origins  of equatorial spread-F, long and short
              period fluctuations in ionospheric plasma drifts and their  implications on the
              coupling of the low-latitude ionosphere to higher latitudes, generation 
              mechanisms of the equatorial irregularities at 150 km altitude and remote
              sensing of those  echoes, broadband measurements of the absolute scattering
              cross section of equatorial electrojet  and 150 km irregularities, and
              interferometric imaging of ionospheric plasma irregularity  structures. 
              Additional research efforts will be directed toward the analysis, modeling, and
               development of atmospheric/ionospheric radar remote sensing techniques.  ***
