Abstract    :
              Kramer    Under the direction of Dr. Carol Kramer, Mr. Adam Smith will  collect
              data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study Urartu  settlement pattern as
              revealed in a series of archaeological  sites. Between the ninth and sixth
              centuries B.C., the ancient  state of Urartu spread from its capital on Lake
              Van, conquering  much of what is today eastern Turkey, Armenia and Iranian 
              Azerbaijan. As it expanded, Urartu imposed a new spatial order on  the
              territories it acquired. In his research, Mr. Smith will  study an number of
              sites in Armenia. These span a range of time  and include both pre-Urartu,
              early and late Urartu settlements.  He will employ an electronic mapping system
              to construct accurate  site plans and supplement these data with schematic
              drawings on  artifacts from Urartu sites. On this basis he will determine how 
              imperial control is both reflected in and reinforced by  architectural
              arrangement. He will study the use of space and the  control of access into
              specific areas.    This research is of interest for several reasons. First, it
              will  shed light on the development of state level societies in a  poorly known
              portion of the world. Secondly, it will help to  develop an analytic technique
              with the potential for widespread  archaeological use. Finally it will assist
              in the training of a  promising young scientist.
