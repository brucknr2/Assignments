Abstract    :
              9424210  Sargent       Faculty from Furman University and the University of
              South  Carolina-Aiken will cooperate to provide a nine-week research 
              experience for eight undergraduate geology majors each year.   Students will be
              drawn from two consortia of predominantly  undergraduate schools in the
              southeast.  All of the research  projects deal with some aspect of southeastern
              Appalachian geology.  Two involve geologic mapping in the Inner Piedmont and
              Carolina Arc  Terranes, both complex and poorly understood areas.  The third 
              tackles the problem of provenance of the Middle Ordovician Bays  Formation in
              east Tennessee and the history of terrane accretion in  that area.  Although
              the filed areas are somewhat dispersed, the  students will meet at regular
              intervals to visit field sites, share  research ideas, build a common
              understanding of Appalachian  geology, and discuss readings in scientific
              philosophy and ethics.
