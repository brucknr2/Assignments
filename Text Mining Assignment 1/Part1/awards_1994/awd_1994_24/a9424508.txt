Abstract    :
              DMS-9424508 Shen  The proposed research project will concentrate  on the
              development of asymptotics, rigorous analysis and  numerical methods for the
              investigation of surface wave  resonance, internal waves in a
              density-stratified fluid over an  obstacle, biological fluid flow in elastic
              tubes, surface waves  on a ferromagnetic fluid, and WKB approximation without a
              small  parameter.   The research results to be obtained will have  possible
              applications to the following areas: design of control  devices in space
              science, atmospheric waves with oscillatory  tails past a mountain range, blood
              flow in blood vessels, and  solutions of physical problems without a parameter
              in nuclear  engineering, geophysics, theoretical chemistry and others.
