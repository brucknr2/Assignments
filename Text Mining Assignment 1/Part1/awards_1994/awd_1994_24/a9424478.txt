Abstract    :
                 9424478 Chang   The objectives of this research are to investigate the
              stability of intermetallic contacts to two compound semiconductor alloys,
              InGaAs and InAlAs, which are lattice-matched to InP, and to study the
              electrical behavior of selected intermetallic contacts to these two compound
              semiconductor alloys.   The thermodynamic stabilities of the quaternary systems
              will be studied by determining relevant phase equilibria.  Both the four-point
              probe and transmission line methods will be used to study the electrical
              behavior of the ohmic contacts.  For those material combinations giving
              significant Schottky contacts, both I-V and C-V methods will be used.  Films of
              intermetallics will be deposited on the compound semiconductor alloys by
              sputter deposition, and annealing of the contacts will be carried out using a
              rapid thermal annealing furnace.  The metal/semiconductor interfaces will be
              characterized in the as-deposited state and after annealing using a variety of
              surface-sensitive techniques, including TEM, SAM and GAXRD (glancing angle
              x-ray diffraction). %%% The results of the proposed study are expected to
              provide improved fundamental understanding of the relationship between
              electrical behavior of intermetallics/compound semiconductor alloy
              combinations, and the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities at their
              interfaces.  Concurrently, the research investigation can have a significant
              impact on the design and development of optoelectronic and high-speed
              electronic devices for practical applications.  An important feature of the
              program is the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
              significant area of materials research. ***
