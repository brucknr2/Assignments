                 PROPOSAL:  DMS 94-24490  PI:   Mike West  TITLE:     WORKSHOP ON STATISTICAL
              MIXTURE MODELLING      ABSTRACT:  The Workshop provides a forum for reviewing
              and publicizing widely dispersed research activities in mixture modelling, to
              stimulate fertilization of theoretical, methodological and computational
              research directions for the near future, and, significantly, to focus attention
              on the burgeoning arena of applied problems in complex stochastic systems that
              are inherently structured in mixture terms. The Workshop will heavily
              concentrate in topical problems with strong cross-disciplinary and
              computational components, featuring mixture problems in areas such as density
              estimation, regression and time series; mixtures in statistical image modelling
              and analysis, neural networks and signal processing; graphical models and
              networks; stochastic simulation for mixture analysis; clustering and
              classification problems; model selection and combination; alternative
              approaches to inference in mixtures; latent variables and incomplete data
              problems; and applications of mixtures in various scientific areas.    The
              Workshop is held in recognition of the recent growth and development in the
              theory and, in particular, applications of statistical methods based on
              mixtures of distributions. Mixture models play key roles in many complex
              modelling and inference problems in science, engineering and social sciences,
              and advances in computational statistical technology have, and continue to,
              promote their wider use. This  Workshop provides a forum for reviewing and
              publicizing widely dispersed research activities in mixture modelling,
              stimulating fertilization of theoretical, methodological and computational
              research directions for the near future, and focusing attention on the wide
              variety of significant applied problems in complex stochastic systems that are
              inherently structured in mixture terms. The workshop will bring together senior
              researchers, new researchers and students from various backgrounds to prom ote
              exchange and interactions on the frontiers of statistical mixture modelling, to
              highlight the development of statistical technology across these fields, to
              promote interchanges between researchers in various applied fields, and to
              highlight the utility of mixture models in diverse fields such as genetics,
              astronomy and physics, the neuro-sciences, and others.
