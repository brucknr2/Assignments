Abstract    :
              9424396  Montgomery-Smith      This project involves work on two different
              fronts. The first involves harmonic analysis on abelian groups whose dual is
              ordered. The project involves taking traditional results from harmonic
              analysis, specifically those concerning analyticity and the conjugate function,
              and generalizing them to a new setting. This project will be based on a
              synthesis of a classification theorem of Hahn on ordered groups together with
              modern techniques such as martingale theory, Browninan motion and the geometry
              of Banach spaces. The second project involves spectral properties of
              semigroups. This work has applications to the asymptotic behavior of
              differential equations in the case where the coefficients are infinite
              dimensional.      Functional analysis seeks to understand the rigorous side of
              the kind of analysis that was needed to study functions that arise as solutions
              of  differential equations. Harmonic analysis is concerned with studying the
              Fourier transform of functions. Probability, theory originally invented to
              understand events of chance, is now a technical subject related to measure
              theory. This project involves a blending of theses areas of mathematics. The
              results will be of use to a broad spectrum of mathematicians with the potential
              for application in systems theory.
