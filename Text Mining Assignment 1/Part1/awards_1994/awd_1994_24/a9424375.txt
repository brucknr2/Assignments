Abstract    :
              The study of habitat fragmentation has been built upon an understanding of how
              lost habitat,  isolation of habitat patches, and increased habitat edge lead to
              declines in populations.  This  understanding has, in turn, formed the
              foundation for principles of resepve design in conservation  biology.  In order
              to design reserves in the future, traditional studies of fragmentation must be 
              augmented to include: (1) the effect of variation in patch quality in the
              habitat remaining on  individuals in the population, and (2) how these effects
              over time affect population growth or  decline.  In the arid west, and
              throughout much of the world, several factors including irrigation and 
              domestic water use, have combined to result in a general trend toward
              salinization of water available  for wildlife.  High salt levels have been
              shown to pose serious health threats to wildlife, especially  young birds. 
              This project will determine the capacity of young water birds to withstand
              various salt  loads.  The results will allow water management to predict the
              costs to wildlife of increased  salinization.  Eventually,  results can be
              integrated into population models as factors affecting  survival.  These
              modeling results will allow for major improvements in wetland reserve design.
