Abstract    :
              9424177  Spina   An REU Site in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and
              Manufacturing Engineering at Syracuse University is proposed.  The proposal
              will focus on fluid dynamics, including experimental, theoretical, and
              computational projects. The program will be conducted during a 12-week period
              in the summer.  Ten participants will be chosen, with at least seven from
              schools other than Syracuse University.  A strong commitment is made to recruit
              groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in engineering and
              students from universities where research is not emphasized.  Before starting
              individual projects, each student will attend an intensive one-week training
              program that will address basic research techniques.  In addition to one-on-one
              interaction with a faculty mentor, a complementary program of activities is
              planned to enhance the professional development of each participant.  Among
              scheduled activities are a workshop on professional writing, a lecture on
              public speaking, and presentations on the role of fluid dynamics research in
              industry by invited speakers.  In addition, a 3-day workshop on
              ethical-decision making will be included in the program .  This workshop will
              be conducted by an expert in the area of ethics and technology.  Finally,
              participants will also prepare a written research proposal, a final written
              report and make oral presentations of proposed work and final results.  ***
