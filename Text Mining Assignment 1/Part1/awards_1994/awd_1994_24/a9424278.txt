Abstract    :
              9424278  Doyle       Research will be carried out leading to a twenty-fold 
              improvement in accuracy of the neutron lifetime.  A new cooling  and trapping
              technique for neutrons will be developed based on  energy dissipation in
              superfluid helium and trapping within a  magnetic well.  The lifetime
              measurement will permit more precise  tests of the standard model of
              electroweak interactions.  The  experiment will be carried out at the National
              Institute of  Standards and Technology research reactor.  This activity is 
              multidisciplinary, bringing together low temperature techniques  and nuclear
              physics techniques.  The new trapping method proposed  will also permit
              development of intense polarized ultra-cold  neutrons for further nuclear
              physics studies and for future  materials research studies.  The lifetime
              measurement and the  possible study of triple correlations in neutron
              beta-decay are  high priority activities in contemporary nuclear physics and 
              studies of fundamental symmetries.  Development, construction,  and utilization
              of major state-of-the-art equipment is integral  to this activity.  Education
              of graduate students and postdocs is  a strong component in every aspect of
              this grant.***
