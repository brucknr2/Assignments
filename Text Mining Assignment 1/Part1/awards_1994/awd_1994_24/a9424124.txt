Abstract    :
              9424124  Hyde  A program of summer graduate research will be carried out by the 
              Physics Department at Baylor University.  This will supplement a  very
              successful, but modest, program in place at Baylor during  the past summer. 
              Seven students will be identified for the  program by applications targeted at
              smaller undergraduate  institutions which have little, if any, undergraduate
              research  opportunities available on their campuses.  Historically 
              predominantly Black and Hispanic campuses will also be  particularly targeted
              as will predominantly minority junior  colleges.  The other campuses will be
              both nationally and  regionally selected, including all such Texas, Louisiana, 
              Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas schools.  These include many  institutions
              with large Hispanic enrollments.  The students will  participate with Baylor
              Students and students from several  foreign countries in cross cultural
              experiences in addition to  weekly seminars, an end of summer Undergraduate
              Research  Symposium, as well as specially designed classes in various  physics
              research fields of interest.  Trips to nearby industries  and research
              institutions will be organized.  This research is  expected to lead to journal
              publications.  ***
