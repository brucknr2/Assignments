Abstract    :
              9424159  Long   The REU Site at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst will
              involve students in research areas in environmental, geotechnical and
              transportation engineering.  The students will be under the supervision of
              faculty in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at U Mass -
              Amherst.  The program will contain:  1) a self-contained research project for
              each student that is aligned with a larger funding project, 2) individual
              direction by graduate students and faculty members, 3) regular research project
              meetings, 4) a final report written by the undergraduate researchers, and 5)
              weekly meeting/seminars with other undergraduate researchers, including a
              series of outside speakers.  Faculty and students will be matched according to
              applicability of projects, desires of faculty and students, the needs of
              faculty, and the abilities of students.  ***
