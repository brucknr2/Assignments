Abstract    :
              9424595  Spitze  The maintenance of genetic diversity is of central importance
              to establishing management strategies for conservation measures involving
              endangered species. This is because high levels of genetic variation are
              assumed to enhance the probability of a populations survival over time. Loss of
              genetic diversity resulting from a reduction in population size may lead to
              inbreeding depression increasing the risk of extinction. Also, the rate of
              genetic change is a function of the amount of genetic variation in quantitative
              traits. Thus, populations with high genetic variation are more adaptable than
              those with low variation. This conservation and restoration biology research
              will test the utility and predictive power of conventional molecular genetic
              techniques that are commonly used to assess genetic diversity to quantify the
              level of genetic variation in natural populations. The results of this research
              will shed light on this important conservation issue by examining the
              relationship between quantitative genetic variation and allozyme
              heterozygosity, and quantitative genetic variation and diversity measures
              obtained by molecular techniques. Overall, these results will investigate the
              empirical basis for the use of molecular markers to assess adaptive potential
              of populations with high and low genetic variability.
