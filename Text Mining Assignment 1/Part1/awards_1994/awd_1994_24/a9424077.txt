Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate  researchers in
              mathematics working under the supervision of  several faculty advisors. The
              research at this site will be on  topics in algebra and number theory. The
              program will run for  eight weeks. The students will be expected to make oral
              progress  reports throughout the summer and a final written report at the  end.
