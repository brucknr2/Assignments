Abstract    :
              Embedded computing systems must be designed to meet hard, soft,   performance,
              cost and other constraints.  This research studies the  synthesis of embedded
              systems built from multiple processors, which  may be commercial or
              application-specific ICs connected in a  network.  This methodology,
              co-synthesis, aims to simultaneously  design the hardware and software
              architectures of a system.   Algorithms for meeting all constraints through
              iteration of both  the hardware architecture of the distributed computing
              engine and  the process architecture of the application software are being 
              investigated.  The model for the research is the task graph and  distributed
              system graph.  These are being extended based on  simultaneous design the
              hardware and software, stronger assumptions  about processes in the task graph,
              and simultaneous scheduling,  allocation, and partitioning of processes during
              co-synthesis.   Mathematical optimization methods, such as graph partitioning
              and  network flow, are being used to generate effective design  algorithms.
