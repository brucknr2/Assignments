Abstract    :
              DMS-9424122  Shaw    Shaw will continue her work on pde's arising from problems
              in several complex variables.  In particular, she will study the Cauchy-Riemann
              equations and tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations on complex and CR manifolds. 
              One of the central problems she will work on is to understand the local and
              global solvability and regularity of the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations. 
              She will also study the regularity of the Bergman projection and the boundary
              regularity of the d-bar on nonsmooth pseudoconvex domains.    Several complex
              variables arose at the beginning of the century  as a natural outgrowth of
              studies of functions of one complex  variable.  It became clear early on that
              the theory differed  widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was
              far more  difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity 
              with partial differential operators of first order.  It thus grew  as a hybrid
              subject combining deep characteristics of  differential geometry and
              differential equations.  Many of the  fundamental structures were defined in
              the last three decades.   Current studies still concentrate on understanding
              these basic  mathematical forms.
