Abstract    :
              9424246  Leventhal    This award will provide partial support for a science
              symposium on  "Clusters, Lensing, and the Future of the Universe", June 26-28, 
              1995, at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland.     The University
              of Maryland, Department of Astronomy, is hosting  the annual meeting of the
              Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP)  from June 24-28, 1995.  As part of
              this meeting, the Department of  Astronomy has sole responsibility for
              organizing a Science  Symposium.  The title of the symposium is "Clusters,
              Lensing, and  the Future of the Universe".  It  will be held at the College
              Park,  Maryland campus of the University of Maryland from June 26 to 28 , 
              1995.  It is anticipated that approximately 150 professional  astronomers will
              attend and participate in the symposium.  A  smaller and unknown number of
              amateur astronomers are also likely  to attend.    The primary purpose of this
              symposium is to bring together  people working on three of the major unsolved
              problems of modern  astrophysics, in the expectation that the problems (and
              their  hoped-for solutions) have aspects in common.  Roughly, the  questions
              can be phrased as (a) How should we describe the  largest-scale structures in
              the universe? (b) How did the  structures form without producing stronger
              imprints in the cosmic  microwave background radiation? and (c) Which values of
              the  standard cosmological parameters and of the inflationary universe  model
              parameters best describe the universe during the epoch of  galaxy formation,
              the present time, and the long range future?  The  intended format of the
              symposium includes about 20 reviews by  invited speakers, each accompanied by a
              couple of shorter  contributed talks; and a number of poster paper
              contributions on  related topics.
