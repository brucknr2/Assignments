Abstract    :
              This project involves research in Ramsey Theory, the theory of compact left
              topological semigroups, and their interactions. Significant results in Ramsey
              Theory have been obtained by utilizing the algebraic structure of the space of
              all ultrafilters on a discrete semigroup. As a compact left topological
              semigroup, this space possesses an algebraic structure. This structure leads to
              strong combinatorial results. Conversely, combinatorial results have been
              applied to improve the understanding of this algebraic structure.     This
              research is in the general area of Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to
              find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be
              arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern
              communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as thus
              occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer
              science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial
              research. Ramsey Theory is the branch of discrete mathematics which deals with
              the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in
              some one cell of a finite partition of specified sets (or sometimes in any
              suitably large subset). It began as an applied subject and has continued to
              find applications to fields as diverse as logic, game theory and analysis.
