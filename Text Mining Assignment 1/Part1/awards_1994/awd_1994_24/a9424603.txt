Abstract    :
              9424603  Sturges   This project will extend the ability of automated machines in
              assembly of three dimensional components using what is termed a spatial remote
              center compliance (SRCC) device.  This passive device, like its two dimensional
              counterpart, the remote center compliance, does not require active feedback
              control for these tasks.  The engineering problem and objectives are to design
              and build SRCC's that can handle non-axisymmetric prismatic parts of arbitrary
              cross section and general shapes with a segmented insertion path.  In handling
              these problems, the basis for analysis is identification of the contacts in
              three dimensions, i.e., point, line or surface.  The kinematics of these
              contacts can be used to determine the dexterity requirements, leading to a
              design that can handle the proposed three dimensional assembly tasks.  
              Assembly remains a costly, error prone, and ubiquitous process, and automatic
              systems using active feedback control can be slow and costly.  Results from
              this project will provide a robust and cost effective solution to these
              important quality and productivity problems.  ***
