              Roberts The FASEB Summer Research Conference,  Phospholipases  will be held
              July 22-27, 1995 in Saxtons River, Vermont. The study of lipids and signaling
              events has been an exciting area of research in recent years.  The
              phospholipase field is changing rapidly as structural information becomes
              available for many of the prototypical phospholipases.  The field is at a
              confluence of cell biology, biochemistry, and biophysics.  This is the only
              meeting that encompasses all aspects of the biology of phospholipases.   %%%
              Phospholipases are enzymes that play key roles in many cellular processes.  The
              field encompasses cell biology, biochemistry and biophysics.  This meeting will
              bring together researchers from these fields, and should be of benefit to
              progress in the study of phospholipases. ***
