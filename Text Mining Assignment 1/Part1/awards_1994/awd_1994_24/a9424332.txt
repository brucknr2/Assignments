Abstract    :
              9424332  Fox   The Northeast Parallel Architectures Center (NPAC) at Syracuse
              University will offer a summer REU site program for 12 undergraduate
              participants each year for 3 years.  The program will offer research in High
              Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) and will involve faculty from
              NPAC, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Department of
              Physics, and the Newhouse School of Public Communications.  This program will
              be a continuation of the successful REU program at NPAC over the past four
              years.    Research stipends will be awarded to talented and motivated
              undergraduate students entering their junior and senior years.  At least 8 of
              the 12 REU participants will be selected from external applicants attending
              other colleges and universities.  Women, minorities, and disabled students are
              especially encouraged to apply.  The program will last 10 weeks each summer.   
              The focus of the research topics will be high performance computing and
              communication applications in physics and media communications.  Faculty will
              supervise projects in such topics as parallel computing languages, software and
              algorithms, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, optimization
              problems, computer graphics and virtual reality, parallel databases, natural
              language processing, high-speed networking and ATM technologies, development
              and application of multimedia technologies such as video-on- demand and the
              World Wide Web, and the use of HPCC for education.  ***
