Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to use large-scale, biophysically  detailed models
              of the mammalian sinus node and atrium to  understand dynamics of interaction
              between these two systems  under a variety of conditions. Among the specific
              aims are: 1)  development of an SA node - atrial network model incorporating 
              recently discovered date on the interdigitation of these two  tissue regions;
              2) development of a network model of vagal  control of heart rate. Model
              studies will involve a combination  of single cell and network analyses.
              Dynamics of single cells  will be studied using techniques of nonlinear
              dynamical systems  theory. Network simulations will be implemented on both the 
              parallel Connection Machine CM-5 and the symmetric  multi-processing Silicon
              Graphics Power Challenge XL  supercomputers.
