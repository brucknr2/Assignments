              research  opportunities with an emphasis on nutrient flux/mass energy 
              transformations, crustacean larval biology and hydrocarbon  contamination in
              marine environments, to acquaint the students with  the excitement and
              opportunities of academic research and to  encourage them to pursue graduate
              studies and a career in research.
