Abstract    :
              Abstract   Girshick   CTS-9424271      The PI points out that a crucial issue in
              the commercialization of CVD diamond lies in the development of morphology
              control under high growth rate conditions.  This proposal addresses this key
              issue by considering the following objectives:  (1) To relate diamond growth
              rates and the morphology parameter a to process conditions in an rf thermal
              plasma reactor; (2) To relate a to actual surface conditions during film
              growth, i.e. , species concentrations and surface temperature; (3) To relate
              film quality to surface conditions, growth rates and morphology; (4) To assess
              the feasibility of growing smooth <100>-textured films at high growth rates. 
              The PI plans to attain these research objectives through a combination of
              diamond growth experiments involving on-line diagnostics for temperature and
              species concentrations, and off-line diagnostics to analyze the deposited films
              and by carrying out numerical modeling.  The experiments will make use of a
              reactor in which an rf plasma is accelerated through a nozzle to produce thin
              boundary layers, which are known to promote high growth rates.  The
              experimental parameters to be varied include the flow rates of hydrogen,
              methane and argon, the substrate surface temperature, the nozzle exit diameter,
              and chamber pressure.  Diagnostics will include gas chromatography and mass
              spectroscopy of gaseous samples obtained through micro-orifices located in the
              substrate, and non-intrusive techniques of emission spectroscopy and laser
              induced fluorescence.  A previously existing code which treats the rf plasma,
              the chemical kinetics in the substrate boundary layer, and the film growth
              chemistry at the diamond surface will be modified to account for the new
              reactor design.
