Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9424513  Sterling    The purpose of this colloquium is to bring
              together a select  group of academic, industry, and government leaders to 
              discuss issues related to the future development and  maintenance of
              underground facilities.  This subject area  includes the clean up and
              preservation of the underground  environment as well as the preservation of the
              surface  environment through the use of underground facilities.  The  outcome
              will provide perspective on the future needs and  conflicts for the use of the
              underground which can help  drive the development of technology and public
              policy.  ***
