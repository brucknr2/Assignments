Abstract    :
              9424079  As host institution, Lehigh University will offer ten  undergraduates a
              summer research experience in freshwater  ecology at the Lacawac Sanctuary in
              NE Pennsylvania.  Students will be recruited broadly from many institutions, 
              with special effort to include minority students.  The  program will be an
              expansion and intensification of an  existing internship program offered since
              1988 through  Lehigh's Pocono Comparative Lakes Program.  Financial  support
              will go mainly to student stipends and housing  costs.  The program will
              involve a complete research  experience--including independent study at the
              student's  home institution--to consist of proposal development,  research
              design, summer research, data analysis and database  documentation, and oral
              and written reports.  Research  topics will closely tie-in to projects of a
              series of  designated potential summer mentors, who have on-going  studies at
              the field site.  This will ensure that students  are exposed to current issues
              in ecological research, and to  modern techniques and equipment. Particular
              emphasis will be  paid to instructing students in effective standards for 
              recording and documenting data and in ethical issues  encountered in scientific
              research, such as questions of  ownership of data from publicly funded research
              and ultimate  authorship of publications.  Through weekly meetings with 
              mentors, research seminars, recreational opportunities, and  the natural
              history and conservation program of the Lacawac  Sanctuary itself, interns will
              receive a broad appreciation  of the role of scientific research in the broader
              scheme of  environmental conservation.
