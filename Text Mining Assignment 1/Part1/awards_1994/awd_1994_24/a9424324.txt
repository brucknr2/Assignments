Abstract    :
                  9424324  Ma  A laboratory hot press wil be purchased with funds partially 
              provided by this grant.  The main use of the press will be in  processing
              nanophase powders, including consolidation of nanophase  intermetallics and
              nanophase ceramics.  A systematic study of  densification and deformation
              behaviors will be carried out.  Other  powder processing projects will also
              benefit from the new  equipment.  ***
