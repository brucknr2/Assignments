Abstract    :
              This REU site in ecology, behavior and evolution will  provide undergraduates
              contemplating a career in the  biological sciences with 1) an introduction to
              current  research in the areas of soil ecology, plant and insect  ecology and
              evolution, plant physiology, and behavioral  ecology; 2) the opportunity to
              conduct original research in  a supportive, interactive environment; 3)
              instruction in the  planning, execution, and interpretation of research in the 
              areas of ecology, evolution and behavior.  Students will be  recruited with
              special attention to encouraging  participation of groups underrepresented in
              the biological  sciences.
