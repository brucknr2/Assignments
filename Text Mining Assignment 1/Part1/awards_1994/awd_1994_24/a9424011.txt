Abstract    :
              Dr. Glenn Nagel and other members of the Department of Chemistry and  
              Biochemistry of the California State University at Fullerton are being  
              supported to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)   site in
              chemistry.  For the period 1995-97, ten undergraduate students   will spend ten
              weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of   research projects in
              traditional areas of chemistry and biochemistry.    The program is designed to
              enhance the students' interest and fascination   in chemistry and biochemistry;
              the students' technical skills in the   laboratory; their ability to design and
              interpret experiments; and their   ability to communicate verbally and in
              writing.  A unique feature of this   program is the ethics component -- a
              seminar series entitled `Science,   Ethics, and the Environment` which examines
              ethical and environmental   issues related to the students' research.
