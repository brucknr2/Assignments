Abstract    :
                   The visual cortex is a main center of the brain for processing visual
              input.  From physiological recordings, it is known that part of this area acts
              as a "map" of visual space, so that an object in a particular place in the
              visual world evokes activity in nerve cells (neurons) in a particular place in
              the visual cortex.  It remains unclear just how that neural activity in space
              and time is related to the perception of an object and its location.  This
              project utilizes further development of a novel multiple-electrode array to
              investigate how highly local stimuli might mimic normal visual signals. 
              Engineering techniques are developed to interface the array with the brain, and
              to provide adequate stimulation in a way to test feasibility for a visual
              prosthesis for the blind.  Electrophysiological tests will be done to try to
              correlate stimulation patterns with thresholds for visual sensation.  Results
              will provide valuable information on how spatially patterned visual stimuli
              produce visual perceptions of objects in the world.  This work will have an
              impact not only on visual neuroscience, but on clarifying neurobiological
              principles of coding in the cortex in general, and on the development of
              bioengineering visual aids for the blind.
