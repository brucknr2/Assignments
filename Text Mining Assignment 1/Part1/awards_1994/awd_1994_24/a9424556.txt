Abstract    :
              9424556  Boolchand, Punit    This award for a dispersive Raman spectrometer
              system will  be used for basic investigations of network glasses.  Constraint
              theory predicts the glass forming tendency of a  network to be optimized near
              the stiffness (or rigidity  percolation) threshold, when a number of
              constraints per  atom exactly equals the degrees of freedom per atom.  It is 
              proposed to examine in detail, the physical nature of this  stiffness threshold
              in chalcogenide glasses using  complementary probes: Raman scattering and
              Lamb-Mossbauer  factors.  These experiments may lead to an understanding of 
              the medium range order of these glasses, which is presently  not understood.   
              This instrument will be shared by investigators conducting  fundamental
              materials research on technologically important  glasses and semiconductor
              materials, and by engineers  conducting research in the area of photonic
              materials and  millimeter wave technology.
