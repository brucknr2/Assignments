Abstract    :
                  9424113  Rosakis  This project will study the dynamic decohesion and failure
              of  polymer/metal and polymer/ceramic biomaterial interfaces.  It is a 
              cooperative three year parallel experimental and analytical study  involving
              two universities with differing expertise.  A variety on  biomaterial systems
              possessing different mechanical property  mismatch and bond strengths will be
              tested.  Fractographic studies  of the failure surfaces using SEM microscopy
              will be made.  High  strain rates will be included in the experiments.  The
              results of  differing experiments will be jointly evaluated.  ***
