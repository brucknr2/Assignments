Abstract    :
                9424636  Ma    This proposed research project, to be conducted jointly by 
              researchers at Yale and at the Xinjiang Institute of Physics of  the Chinese
              Academy of Sciences, is designed to answer some  important scientific questions
              concerning advanced thin gate  dielectrics for future generations of MOS
              (Metal-Oxide-  Semiconductor) integrated circuit technology.    The objective
              of this collaborative research project is to  achieve a better understanding of
              the role of nitrogen and  fluorine in improving the thin gate oxide
              reliability.  In  particular, we hope to answer the questions as to (i) how the
               concentration and spatial distribution of nitrogen or fluorine  affect the
              electrical properties of the gate oxide, (ii) how the  concentration and
              spatial distribution of nitrogen or fluorine  affect the hot-carrier effects
              (including dielectric breakdown)  as well as radiation effects in MOS devices,
              (iii) whether/how  the incorporation of nitrogen or fluorine affect the
              hydrogen  migration in the oxide, (iv) whether/how the incorporation  of 
              nitrogen or fluorine causes strain relaxation near the SiO 2/Si  interface, and
              (v) how the processing parameters affect the  concentration and distribution of
              nitrogen or fluorine.  The  knowledge to be gained from this research could
              serve as a useful  guide for the semiconductor industry in their process 
              development, and thereby help to accelerate the development of  this advanced
              gate oxide technology to commercial maturity.
