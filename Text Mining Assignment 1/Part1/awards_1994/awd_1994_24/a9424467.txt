Abstract    :
              9424467  Tedrow  The  discovery of spin-polarized electron tunneling has made 
              possible  detailed  probing  of the superconducting state  in  the  presence 
              of  applied  magnetic  fields  to an extent not previously  possible.   In 
              particular,  the  development of tunnel  barriers  that  act  as  spin  filters
               has greatly increased the versatility of this technique.   In  this  work, the
              spin-polarized tunneling technique will be applied  to  the   investigation  
              of   the  density   of   states   of   thin-film  superconductors in three
              regimes of external influence.  In the  first  regime,   the  superconductor 
              will  be  subjected  to  injection   of  quasiparticles   through  a 
              spin-filter  tunnel  barrier   to   allow  observatio of possible
              spin-dependent nonequilibrium effects.  In  the  second, spin state mixing
              caused by spin-orbit scattering and magnetic  exchange  interactions  arising 
              in  rare-earth  impurities  will   be  studied.   Finally, the exchange
              proximity effect will be  used  along  with the tunneling spectroscopy to
              attempt to verify the existence  of  the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
              state.  %%%  Experiments  are  proposed  to study the  distribution  of 
              conduction  electron  energies  (the so-called "density of states")  in 
              thin-film  superconducting  materials by means of the experimental  technique 
              of  spin-polarized  electron tunneling.  In this technique,  electrons  of  one
              spin (magnetic moment) orientation "tunnel" preferentially through  an 
              insulating magnetic barrier into the superconductor; the resulting  current
              provides a map of the electron energies in the superconductor.  Further
              information will be gained by studying these effects under the  influence of
              external magnetic fields and in the presence of  magnetic  impurity atoms doped
              into the superconducting films.  ***
