Abstract    :
              9424397  Stensrud        Due to nonlinearities in the physics of the atmosphere,
              deterministic  predictions of the atmosphere have their limitations.  A
              technique known as  ensemble forecasting is believed to provide a mechanism for
              improving forecasts of  the atmosphere.  Ensemble forecasting involves running
              a series of numerical  predictions by changing, within reason, model initial
              conditions or model physics.   The objective is to provide forecasts that
              define the range of  possible solutions.   These techniques have shown promise
              for forecast improvement.        A joint project between the Cooperative
              Institute for Mesoscale  Meteorological Studies and the University of Colorado
              is proposed with the  objective to develop and test ensemble forecasting
              techniques for mesoscale models.   The proposed research will focus upon the
              difficulties involved in accurately  predicting mesoscale convective weather
              events.  Three specific objectives of the  research are:  1) to develop a 
              technique to modify the mesoscale model initial  conditions to define the
              ensemble group that maximizes the span of model solutions  across the
              predictability phase space using a minimum number of simulations, while 
              requiring that the ensemble initial conditions remain constrained to the error 
              characteristics of the available observations; 2) to explore the results of
              this  technique for both strongly and weakly forced large-scale environments;
              3) to  determine the applicability of using varying model physics in ensemble
              forecasting  methods..        Knowledge gained from this study will provide
              necessary information on how  to efficiently produce an ensemble forecast using
              a mesoscale model.  It is  anticipated that the model results also will provide
              some guidance on predicting the  model skill for given convective weather
              events.  ***
