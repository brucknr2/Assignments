Abstract    :
              Widom  DMS-9424292    Widom has shown that there are differential equations
              associated with important random matrix models, and has used this fact to
              obtain explicit expressions for various quantities arising in the theory.  He
              will continue this investigation to determine the extent to which the results
              apply to classes of models satisfying some common conditions.  One class of
              deterministic problems deals with the asymptotics of the eigenvalues of finite
              Toeplitz matrices and their analogues.  Each of these has an associated
              "symbol," and one expects to relate the distribution of eigenvalues to the
              values of the symbol.    This proposal concerns the applications of operator
              theory to random matrix models.  In random matrix theory fundamental quantities
              that arise naturally are often related to determinants of certain operators. 
              The asymptotic behavior of  these determinants is of independent interest in
              operator theory.
