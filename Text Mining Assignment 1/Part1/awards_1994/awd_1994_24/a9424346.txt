Abstract    :
              This award supports work in matrix theory.  The principal  investigator will
              seek a better understanding of eigenvalues of  (0,1)-matrices, partially
              ordered sets with the fixed point  property, transversal matroids especially
              those that arise  bicircular matroids of graphs, and tree-packing problems and 
              their relation to the joint-realization of (0,1)-matrices with  prescribed row
              and column sums.  The co-principal investigator  will work on non-negative
              matrices, the related class of  M-matrices and their generalizations, on
              scaling of matrices and  inertia theory of matrices.  The work on sparse matrix
              analysis  and the work on scaling of matrices has applications to problems  in
              manufacturing.    A matrix is a rectangular array with possible entries from a
              wide  variety of rings.  This is a field which originated in the  nineteenth
              century as part of algebra.  It is currently very  active in view of its many
              applications and connections with  other parts of mathematics as well as other
              scientific and  technical disciplines.
