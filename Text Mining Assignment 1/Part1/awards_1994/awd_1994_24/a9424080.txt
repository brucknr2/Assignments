Abstract    :
                9424080  ABBOTT    This is a renewal of a REU SITE Project which provides 
              undergraduates with research opportunities by teaching them to use  one or more
              types of database access and manipulation software  which they can then apply
              to their research project.  The students  are acquainted with the excitement
              and opportunities of academic  research and encouraged to pursue graduate
              studies and a science  career.
