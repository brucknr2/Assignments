              Title: Prediction of the Seasonal Climate Anomalies Over Eastern         Africa
                 The primary objective of this grant is to develop a numerical  modeling
              system for predicting the onset, intensity and withdrawal  of seasonal rains
              over East Africa.  For this purpose, high  resolution nested grid model
              simulations will be conducted and  through an international cooperative
              arrangement such a prediction  system will be tested and refined against the
              seasonal forecasts  issued by the Drought Monitoring center, Nairobi.    This
              project is important to understand and predict the climate  fluctuations over a
              number of East Africa countries such as  Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda,
              Somalia, Uganda and Tanzania and  to assess their possible impacts.
