Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9424480  Glumac    This proposal is for funds for the purchase of
              a pulsed Nd/Yag Laser System (including a dye laser and Frequency Doubler). 
              The equipment will be used to develop laser optical diagnostic measurement
              capabilities in the low pressure combustion/combustion diagnostic facility
              currently under construction in the Mechanical and Aerospace Departments of
              Rutgers University.  The equipment will be used to make gas phase temperature
              and species concentration measurements (in particular radical species) in
              connection with programs on catalytic combustion, acetylene oxidation, and
              oxidation of CVD diamond.
