Abstract    :
              9424551  Pickett  This proposal seeks funding to partially support the 6th Cary
              Conference on, "Enhancing the ecological basis for conservation: heterogeneity,
              ecosystem function, and biodiversity," to be held 9-11 May, 1995. The
              conference will focus on the synthesis and future development of the ecological
              foundation of conservation practice. The general goals of the conference are to
              (1) evaluate a theoretical framework for conservation biology that addresses
              the emerging focus on species networks and entire ecosystems, (2) explore the
              linkages of the non-equilibrium paradigm of ecology with the practice of
              conservation, and (3) expose the findings of the conference to a larger
              audience for evaluation, modification, and application. As with previous
              conferences, the emphasis of this meeting will be on discussion and examination
              of fundamental issues in ecology and their application. The results of the
              conference will be published    This conference is an important, timely, and
              cost-effective forum for discussion and dissemination of information on the
              ecological underpinnings of conservation biology.
