Abstract    :
              DMS-9424053  PI: Collingwood    The proposed research will investigate the
              connection between the singularity theory of Harish-Chandra modules and the
              matrix coefficient asymptotics of Harish-Chandra modules. The first step is to
              link the existence of global Whittaker models, the structure of cell
              representations of the Weyl group, the theory of nilpotent orbits and the
              structure of Jacquet modules.  Next one uses recursive algorithm to compute the
              weight filtration of any degenerate series. Finally, relating the PI's earlier
              work on smooth embeddings with the embeddings of Matsuki-Oshima, one obtains
              better understanding of the embeddings of irreducible representations into
              principal series representations.      The theory of Lie groups, named in honor
              of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
              symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has
              had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and
              number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
              elementary particle physics.
