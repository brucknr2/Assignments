Abstract    :
                  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program and the Office of
              multidisciplinary Activities  are supporting the research of Dr. Marc M.
              Greenberg of the Department of Chemistry at  Colorado State University.  Dr.
              Greenberg will focus his work on developing solid phase  oligonucleotide
              synthesis supports.  The resulting protected oligonucleotides have important 
              biological properties and the work has important biotechnical implications.    
               The focus of this research is the development of orthogonal linkers for solid
              phase  oligonucleotide synthesis that utilize known photochemical and
              organometallic reactions, and  conjugation of the biopolymers released from
              these novel supports.  Conjugation methodology  will focus on the formation of
              bonds between oligonucleotides and peptides as well as between  two
              oligonucleotides.  The methodology will be particularly useful for the
              synthesis of RNA  molecules.
