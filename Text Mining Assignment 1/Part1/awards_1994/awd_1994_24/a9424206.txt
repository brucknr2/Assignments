Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for six undergraduate  researchers in
              mathematics each summer for two years. The  research at this site will be on
              topics in analysis, probability,  and finite mathematics. The program will run
              for ten weeks.   Participants will be expected to provide regular reports on
              their  work at informal meetings which will include all of the  participants
              and  appropriate faculty members.
