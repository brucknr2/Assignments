Abstract    :
              9424063  Flickinger  This  project  is on research to study the polymer
              technology  of  immobilizing  cells  as well as the behavior  of  confined 
              cells  under  starvation conditions.  The immobilization system consists  of 
              three layers: a non porous support; cells and polymer; and  a  thin  covering 
              skin.   Cell  viability  after  preparation   and  storage,  as  well as the
              expression of different genes,  message  stability,  etc.  will be
              investigated.  The  morphology  of  the  matrix  will  also  be  characterized
              and  used  to  improve  the  biological outcome.  A major goal of the research
              is to  maximize  the  viability  of  the immobilized cells.   Also,  the 
              periodic  revival of the cells by nutrient addition will be examined.  ***
