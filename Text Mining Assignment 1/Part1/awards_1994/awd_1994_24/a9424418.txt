Abstract    :
              Sogge  DMS-9424418    Sogge will continue his work on problems in classical
              analysis and pde's that relate to the wave equation.  He will attempt to prove
              sharp results concerning Fourier analysis in domains which will have
              applications to questions about nonlinear wave equations in bounded domains. 
              He will also investigate small-data existence theorems for semilinear wave
              equations in Euclidean space.  This will require new types of mixed-norm
              estimates for solutions of the wave equation involving non-trivial angular
              norms.    Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling
              of the physical world.  The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to
              create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative
              information about the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about
              uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often develops
              methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these
              approximations.
