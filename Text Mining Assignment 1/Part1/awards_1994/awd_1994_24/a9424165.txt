Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in
              Archaeology through Davidson College.  The award provides the opportunity for
              ten students to join the Athienou Archaeological Project in Cyprus.  Students
              will (1) receive instruction in survey and excavation techniques (e.g., remote
              sensing, computer-assisted mapping), record keeping and data management, and
              artifact analysis; (2) participate in seminars taught by experts on
              archaeological method and theory and the cultural history of Cyprus; (3) visit
              prehistoric and historic sites on Cyprus; (4) plan and complete an independent
              research project; and (5) live in Athienou and learn about life in modern
              Cyprus from the villagers.  Three faculty and three graduate students will
              provide the primary instruction along with other project specialists.  The
              students will master the methods of archaeological field research, including
              new high tech approaches to data collection and analysis, and gain a better
              understanding of archaeological theory during the eight week program.  This
              award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented
              students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
              experiences.
