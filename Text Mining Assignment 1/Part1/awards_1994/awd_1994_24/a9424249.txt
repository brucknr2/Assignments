Abstract    :
              9424249  Ongley       A group of four faculty from Bates College, Dartmouth
              College,  Castleton State (Vermont) in the U.S., and the Universidad Nacional 
              Autonoma de Mexico propose a series of research projects involving  12
              students.  All projects focus on water contamination associated  with mining
              activity near Hidalgo, Mexico.  With a primary emphasis  on arsenic
              contamination, students will track sources and possible  flow paths in order to
              predict the most probable location of  unpolluted groundwater in a populated
              valley southeast of the  mines.  The students will receive preliminary training
              at Bates,  travel to Mexico for a month of field work, then return to Bates 
              for analytical work and data interpretation.  The all-female group  of site
              leaders have introduced flexibility to accommodate non-  traditional students,
              and will encourage participation by  Hispanic/Latino students.  Immersion in
              the Mexican culture is an  additional benefit of this scientifically valuable
              project.
