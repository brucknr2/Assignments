Abstract    :
              This award supports summer research by undergraduates at the  University of
              Kentucky College of Medicine.  Students pursue  research projects of their own
              choosing during the 10-week  program, which also includes an intensive short
              course that  covers anatomical, physiological, behavioral and  developmental
              aspects of modern neuroscience.  Other student  activities provide a better
              understanding of the elements of  graduate training and the various career
              opportunities in  neuroscience.
