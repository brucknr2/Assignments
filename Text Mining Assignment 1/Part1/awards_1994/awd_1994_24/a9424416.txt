Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    AST-9424416  Ostriker, Jeremiah P.    This theoretical research
              project, directed by Dr. Ostriker, has the objective of elucidating the
              physical processes occurring in active and quiescent galactic nuclei.  While
              there is general agreement that a proper model will include a dense stellar
              system and in all likelihood a gaseous disc and one or more massive black
              holes, the detailed mechanism whereby the prodigious energy output is achieved
              remains poorly understood.  The focus of this research is not on the
              electrodynamics or relativistic dynamics in the vicinity of a black hole, but
              on the physical environment in dense stellar systems. Three related areas will
              be studied: (1) hydrodynamics of time-dependent accretion flows; (2) evolution
              of dense stellar systems; and (3) the union of the previous two subjects, i.e.
              physical processes in systems containing both accretion flows and dense stellar
              systems.  ***
