Abstract    :
              9424129  Datye    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for eight 
              undergraduate students at the junior or senior level in chemistry  or chemical
              engineering, selected from institutions other than  the University of New
              Mexico, to work with faculty, graduate  students, and postdoctoral associates
              within the Center for  Microengineered Ceramics at the University of New Mexico
              on  numerous collaborative research projects in advanced materials  processing
              during a ten week summer period.  The research focus  is on synthesis,
              processing, and characterization of advanced  materials, such as ceramic
              powders, thin films, membranes,  absorbents, catalysts, and sol-gel synthesis
              of oxide and  nonoxide ceramics.  %%%  This program provides an invaluable
              opportunity for  undergraduates to gain insight and experience working on 
              challenging, complex interdisciplinary problems in materials  processing.
