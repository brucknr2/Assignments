Abstract    :
              The polar regions are the areas of the earth where the effects of  increased
              ultraviolet radiation first can be detected.  Indications  of increased
              ultraviolet radiation have been reported in both polar  regions.  Increased
              ultraviolet radiation can have severe effects  on humans, as well as on marine
              and terrestrial ecosystems.  The  Arctic, with a population of millions of
              people (including  indigenous populations) may be the first populated area to
              be  affected.  Some major changes may have to occur in northern  societies and
              settlements, especially those harvesting marine and  terrestrial ecosystems. 
              In a few years this issue may become a  concern for media, with the public and
              politicians asking the  science community what we know and what should be done.
                 The International Arctic Science Committee, of which the United  States is a
              member, has initiated a process leading to a report  summarizing our present
              knowledge, and a science plan covering  effects on humans, terrestrial and
              marine ecosystems, and possibly  effects on northern societies and settlements.
               This award will  provide partial support for a small workshop of experts to 
              summarize the results of a 1994 open scientific meeting on the  effects of
              ultraviolet radiation in the Arctic.  The workshop is  co-sponsored by the
              Scientific Committee on Problems of the  Environment.  The report will
              summarize the current state of  knowledge and help prioritize research topics
              in this important  field of Arctic research.
