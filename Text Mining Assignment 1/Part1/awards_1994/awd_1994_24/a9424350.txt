Abstract    :
              DMS-9424350  Heinonen    This award is to partially qupport a conference to be
              held at the University of Michigan in August 1995.  The focus of the conference
              is to high light the important ties between complex analysis and other broad
              areas of analysis that have resulted through the theory of quasiconformal
              mappings.  Key topics of discussion will be conformal mappings, dynamical
              systems, potential theory, Tiechmuller spaces and algebraic geometry, Kleinian
              groups and hyperbolic manifolds, partial differential equations, and
              quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings in space.    Conformal mapping is the
              study of mappings of plane (and higher  dimensional) domains by transformations
              which preserve  infinitesimal angles and orientation.  The maps play central 
              roles in the geometric theory of analytic functions and potential  theory by
              reducing many questions concerning functions defined on  arbitrary domains to
              the same questions restricted to a class of  highly symmetric domains.
