Abstract    :
              9424015  George   This project will provide an environment for minority
              undergraduate students to experience research in Applied Computer Science.  Ten
              minority students will be recruited to the REU program.  Minority institutions
              without graduate programs in Computer Science will be the main focus of the
              recruitment effort.  The major components of the REU program are a summer
              research project and a one day mini-seminar during the academic year.  The
              participants will be given well defined research projects and will participate
              in ongoing research projects.  They will also have the opportunity to interact
              with faculty and graduate students.  The research projects will be designed
              such that the participants can be co-authors of papers.  Such experience is
              expected to encourage the participants to continue their education into
              graduate school and move on the research careers.    The participants will be
              matched with faculty members based on their interests.  Examples of projects
              (not an exhaustive list) are simulation of architectures and protocols, and
              developing efficient implementations for abstract data types in shared memory
              and distributed memory machines.  The participants will work in small groups
              under experienced professors.  They will be expected to write a paper
              describing their research and present the results in a mini-seminar to be
              organized during the academic year.  Contact with the students will be
              maintained throughout the academic year.  ***
