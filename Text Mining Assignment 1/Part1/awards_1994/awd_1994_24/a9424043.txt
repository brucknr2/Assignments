Abstract    :
              DMS-9424043  Rosenberger         This REU site award provides support for ten
              undergraduate  researchers in statistics. The research at this site will come 
              from problems arising in statistical consulting projects. The  program will run
              for ten weeks. There will be seminars during the  summer to present the
              problems involved in the projects to the  other participants.
