Abstract    :
              9424109  Ku    This award provides funding for an evaluator to study the 
              industry/university interaction occurring in the University of  California, San
              Diego's Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center for Ultra-High Speed
              Integrated Circuits and Systems.    The Center continues to meet the
              requirements for an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center.  The
              study will  document the interactions occurring between the industry and 
              university researchers and will provide the data to the Program  Data Bank
              maintained at North Carolina State University.    The Program Manager
              recommends the University of California, San  Diego be awarded $8,000 for the
              first year of a three-year  continuing award.
