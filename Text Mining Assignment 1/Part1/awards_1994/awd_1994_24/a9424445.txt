Abstract    :
              9424445  O'Keeffe    This research program consists of experimental and 
              theoretical studies in crystal chemistry. The  proposed theoretical work
              includes the development of an ab  initio quantum molecular dynamics method for
              simulating the  structure and properties of "ionic" compounds maintained at 
              constant pressure. This will be used to study phase  equilibria and defect
              energetics and structure in a variety  of important compounds. The prototype
              compositions will be  silicon oxides, but considerable effort will be devoted
              to  inventing materials with novel structures and properties.  The bond valence
              method of analyzing bond lengths in  crystals will be extended to include the
              effects of non-  bonded interactions and to accommodate exceptional cations. 
              The mathematics of nets such as occur in zeolites and  framework silicates will
              be studied. The experimental work  will be devoted to synthesis of new nitrides
              and oxides,  with special attention to phases stable at high pressure. 
              Structural characterization of new phases and previously  known important
              phases with incompletely determined  structures will be conducted using X-ray
              and neutron  diffraction. %%%  This research program consists of experimental
              and  theoretical studies in crystal chemistry. The underlying  theme of this
              project is to obtain deeper understanding of  the factors that determine
              crystal structures and their  relationship to chemical and physical properties.
              Examples  of some of the major lines of research are: 1) simulation of  crystal
              structure for application to phase equilibria  studies at high pressures and to
              examine defects in  crystalline materials; 2) measuring electron density 
              distributions in crystals to understand bonding; 3) crystal  structure
              determination to confirm theoretical studies; and  4) the development of
              adequate descriptions of complex  structures.
