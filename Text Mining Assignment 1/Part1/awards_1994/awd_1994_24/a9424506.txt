Abstract    :
              9424506  Carroll   This project will organize extant documents and other related
              materials pertaining to the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV).  In addition
              to facilitating the time-critical development of an in-depth history, this
              project will provide the beginning for a self-sustaining digital library for
              the BEV.  As such it will be the first step in the development of histories of
              the evolving Village information systems and a reference model for other
              community networking projects.
