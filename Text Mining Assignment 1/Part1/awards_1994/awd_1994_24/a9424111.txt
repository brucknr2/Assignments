Abstract    :
              9424211  Leonard  This is an award to support research on  the potential use of
              remote fiber  spectroscopy in a system to detect the  presence and nature of
              organic  contaminants in water.  This research is  based on prior work that led
              to  development of a novel optrode that  utilized a fluorescent indicator to 
              detect and monitor pure polar organic  substances in water solution.  The 
              research to be conducted involves a  technique in which light of an 
              appropriate wave length is launched  through an optical fiber to a remote 
              sample.  The return signal from the  sample is changed by the sample's 
              chemical properties to reveal either the  exact nature of the chemical or the 
              chemical group to which it belongs.    Detection of the presence and 
              concentrations of organic substances  that leak into aquifers is an important 
              step in remediation of soils and  aquifers contaminated by hazardous 
              substances.  Results of this research  are expected to be an important link in 
              overall remote sensing research partly  because  it will focus on practical 
              aspects such as ruggedness, optrode  lifetime and low concentration studies. 
              Future instrumentation based on this  consist has the potential of greatly 
              reducing safety hazards, person hours  and produce real-time chemical data on 
              environmental quality of contaminated  environmental resources.  ***
