Abstract    :
              SHARP  9424146    This project is a renewal of a REU SITE that has been in
              operation  for eight years.  It provides research opportunities in the field 
              of physical, chemical and biological oceanography as well as marine  geology
              and biochemistry. It also acquaints them with the  excitement and opportunities
              of academic research  and encourages  them to pursue graduate studies and a
              career in research.
