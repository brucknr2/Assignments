Abstract    :
              9424226  Crocker    A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in
              Astronomy will  be operated at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa during
              the  summers of 1995, 1996, and 1997.  The major focus of the research for  the
              student projects at this site is in the areas of Astronomy and  Astrophysics.  
              The students will be working with the Astronomy group  within the Department of
              Physics and Astronomy.    There are six academic faculty, one research
              professor, five  postdoctoral researchers, and 12 graduate students in the
              Astronomy  group. It is planned to have five REU summer students each year. 
              The  summer program will run for 10 weeks and will offer a summer stipend  for
              the students of $2700.  Free housing and some travel support will  be provided.
                 The student participants will be chosen on a competitive basis from 
              applications from around the country, but the heaviest recruiting will  be in
              the mid-southern United States.  The students will be involved in  research
              activities and will also take part in coordinated seminars on  science and
              general scientific techniques.  These activities will help  the undergraduate
              students develop good research skills and will  introduce them to current
              research topics.  The student projects are  designed so that the students will
              complete a particular research  project and that there will be scientific
              results obtained by the  students that are publishable in a first rate
              scientific journal.   Selected students will be supported to attend and present
              papers at  professional scientific meetings.
