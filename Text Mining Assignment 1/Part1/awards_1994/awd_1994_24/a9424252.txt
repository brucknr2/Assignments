Abstract    :
              9424252  Osgood  A cooperative research involving the collaboration of 
              Professor Richard Osgood, a faculty member at Columbia University with a
              research group at IBM - T. J. Watson Laboratory, currently directed by Tony
              Heinz will be conducted.  The collaboration will focus on ultrashort-pulse
              (i.e. femtosecond and picosecond) laser measurements of electron-dynamics at
              semiconductor surfaces and interfaces.  The proposed work will allow a study of
              the use of ultrashort pulse techniques required for the measurements of
              electron dynamics at or near single-crystal semiconductor surfaces.  The
              collaboration will begin with a three-month visit of  T.J. Watson Laboratory
              starting in March 1995, and will use the extensive experimental facilities
              there (which are unique and therefore not available at Columbia University) for
              ultrashort laser measurements.  The joint program will allow IBM scientists to
              be involved extensively and continuously in the thesis education of several
              Columbia Ph.D students.  Initial experiments will involve measurements of
              GaAs/Ge system, with subsequent work focusing on a study of Si/SiGe interfaces.
