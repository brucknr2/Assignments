Abstract    :
              Hejhal  DMS-9424368    Hejhal will use high-performance computers to investigate
              three topics: analytic number theory, automorphic forms and the Selberg trace
              formalism, and quantum chaos.  In number theory, the PI will be seeking a
              better understanding of the zeros of various kinds of zeta functions.  He will
              be focusing on the asymptotic spacing pattern in the zeros and seeking to
              reconcile this with certain statistical ensembles arising in random matrix
              theory.    This work has important application to fundamental and long-standing
              questions in number theory.  It also leads to new uses of supercomputing in the
              more theoretical areas of mathematical analysis, both as an experimental tool
              and one which can give sharp probability estimates in situations where precise
              information is too difficult to extract from the functions definitions.
