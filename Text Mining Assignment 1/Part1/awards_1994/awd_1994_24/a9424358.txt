Abstract    :
                This project focuses on determining complexity bounds for  algorithms that
              compute with polynomials.    The first part of this project  deals with
              polynomials with  sparse encodings which can be much shorter than  those
              encodings  traditionally used in computer algebra.  Two problems are  examined:
                      (1) How to find a sparse representation of a polynomial;  (2) How to
              design algorithms that manipulate sparse  polynomial representations.  The
              method of operator eigen-functions, used in the interpolation  problem for 
              sparse polynomials, is exploited.    The second objective of this research 
              project is to obtain a  lower bound for an algebraic decision tree algorithm 
              which tests  the membership of a point in a polyhedron.  This test is a 
              technique which is used in linear programming.  The previous  techniques, for 
              determining lower bounds for such algebraic  decision trees, are based on the 
              topological invariants of a  tested set.  These topological methods cannot be 
              used in this  case, because each polyhedron has trivial topological invariants.
               The new methods explored, are based on the singularities of a set  given by a 
              system of polynomial inequalities.  Applications of  these techniques to 
              complexity of systems of polynomial  inequalities are examined.
