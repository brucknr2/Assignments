Abstract    :
              9424018  Leslie-Pelecky    This REU Site award will provide support for thirteen
               undergraduates to undertake research with 30 faculty members in  an
              interdepartmental, interdisciplinary research program through  the Center for
              Materials Research and Analysis and the EPSCoR  cluster on Nanostructured and
              Complex Materials, during an eleven  week summer program.  The program will
              preferentially recruit  students from the midwest and plains states, with an
              emphasis on  attracting highly qualified minority and women students. 
              Additional support for underrepresented groups will be available  through
              interactions with campus groups such as the Society of  Black Engineers and the
              Association for Women in Science's local  chapter.  Some of the primary
              research topics in nanostructured  materials include:  the correlation between
              magnetic properties  and microstructure in permanent magnet and magneto-optical
               materials, ultrahigh density magnetic recording media, Langmuir  and
              Langmuir-Blodgett films, mechanically alloyed materials for  magnetic and
              structural applications, sputtering techniques for  the production of thin
              films and small particles, high  temperature superconductivity, and surface
              sciences.  %%%  This project will help undergraduates in physics, chemistry,
              and  engineering develop the research and professional skills  necessary for
              success as working scientists and engineers in the  high technological
              workplace.
