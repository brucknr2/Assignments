Abstract    :
                      9424518  Platz    This grant supports a Joint US-Poland Workshop on
              Reactive Intermediates to be  held in Zakopane, Poland, 13-18 August 1995.  The
              organizer for the U.S. side  is Dr. Matthew S. Platz of the Department of
              Chemistry of Ohio State  University.  Fourteen U.S. scientists will
              participate.  Professor Jerzy  Gebicki of the Technical University of Lodz is
              the organizer in Poland.  Eight  senior Polish scientists and several junior
              Polish scientists will  participate.  The workshop will bring together U.S. and
              Polish scientists with  common interests in the chemistry of reactive
              intermediates.  The workshop  will allow focused, in-depth discussion of the
              chemistry of reactive  intermediates.  The organizers anticipate the workshop
              will facilitate the  development of new research collaborations between U.S.
              and Polish scientists  with common interest in complementary expertise in
              organic synthesis,  spectroscopy, kinetics, bio-organic chemistry, and theory. 
                This project in chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing 
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in Poland and the United 
              States to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong 
              mutual interest and competence.  ***
