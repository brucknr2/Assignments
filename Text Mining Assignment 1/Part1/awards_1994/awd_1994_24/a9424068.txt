Abstract    :
              Drawing on the research and teaching expertise of the  Museum's outstanding
              scientific staff, the AMNH program  provides students with a coherent, hands-on
              introduction to  research in systematics and evolutionary biology, areas in 
              which few undergraduates have a solid grounding.  Entering  into the Museum
              community, our students are offered an  extraordianry opportunity to step
              outside of their immediate  university environments, broaden their experience
              of  biological disciplines, and participate in the highest  caliber research at
              a premier academic institution.    The program is a comprehensive, interactive
              learning that  centers around research projects carefully designed to 
              introduce undergraduates to the excitement, challenge, and  relevance of
              systematics and comparative evolutionary  biology.  In addition to hand-on
              experience of research and  publication, our students participate in a
              comprehensive  program of round-table discussions where they discuss their 
              research progress and problems, "show and tell" their latest  findings, and
              thrash-out ideas in an informal and supportive  setting.  A Special Lecture
              Series introduces students to  eminent Museum faculty whose lectures address
              current  debates in systematics and contemporary evolutionary theory.  And
              students participate in a REU Student Seminar where they  give formal
              slide-illustrated presentations to a supportive,  yet critical audience of
              mentors and peers.
