Abstract    :
                The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V CAPE
              HENLOPEN, a 120 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the University. 
              Instrumentation requested includes a transmissometer and a light scattering
              sensor.  The instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-funded
              cruises aboard the CAPE HENLOPEN during 1995 and will enhance the scientific
              capability of the vessel in the future.      ??
