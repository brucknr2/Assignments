Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is on the design and manufacture of  electronic
              circuits at the submicron range for logic, analog, and  mixed-signal
              applications.  This new approach to robust design uses  an interval bound
              description rather than statistical description  of variable parameters
              associated with the manufacturing process.   Evaluation of performance utilizes
              advanced mixed-mode circuit  simulators in which carrier dymanics within
              semiconductor devices  and interconnects are modeled at the application level. 
              The focus  is on the design of algorithms with the long term goal of 
              developing tools to aid in the analysis and design of complex VLSI  circuits . 
              Initial examples being considered are a CMOS  differential amplifier and a CMOS
              inverter.
