Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9424169  M. Maxey    The influence of spherical in the range of
              10-500 (m on dispepsed, two-phase turbulent flow will be investigate. 
              Numerical simulations for the motion of a large number of particles in
              suspension will include the coupling of the particle wakes and the turbulence. 
              A multiple momentum procedure will be used to represent the effect of particles
              on local flow disturbances, for finite particle Reynolds number, in viscous
              fluids with concentrations up 5% by volume.  The overall fluid flow field will
              be simulated with pseudo-special methods.  Preferential particle concentrations
              due to local flow characteristics (vorticity, rate of strain), and the dynamic
              coupling of the particles with the small scale vorticity, will analyzed.  The
              computational results will be compared to bubbly and slurry flow experiments.  
               This study will help develop fundamental understanding for improved modeling
              of two-phase turbulent flow of interest in engineering and environmental
              applications.  ***
