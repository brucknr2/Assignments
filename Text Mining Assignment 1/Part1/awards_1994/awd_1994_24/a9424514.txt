Abstract    :
              The object of this project is to assist the Program Director  in determining
              what practicing professionals and university  faculty believe are the benefits
              and pitfalls of cooperative  research.    The rationale for this endeavor is to
              help maximize the  benefits of funding projects when they may result in 
              international cooperative efforts.    The project will be accomplished
              primarily through  interviews that will be conducted by phone and in person. 
              The project team may review reports resulting from  international conferences
              and research funded in civil  engineering to determine if commonalties exist
              that support  or corroborate information taken from interviews.  the  project
              should provide information that can help the NSF  refine its decision-making in
              this area of grant giving,  making international cooperative research more
              effective and  resulting in information that will benefit the field of  civil
              engineering.  ***
