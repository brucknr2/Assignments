Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate  researchers
              in mathematics. The research at this site will be on  topics in matrix analysis
              and operator theory. The program will  run for eight weeks. During the course
              of the program there will   be seminars on mathematical topics, and field trips
              are planned  for the students to visit nearby installations which employ 
              mathematicians.
