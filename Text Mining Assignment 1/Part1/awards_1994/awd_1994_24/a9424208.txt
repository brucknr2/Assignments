Abstract    :
              Abstract  Jonathan Phillips    This study tests the hypothesis that catalysts
              consisting of  two compositionally distinct particle surfaces will be superior
              to simpler catalysts with a single active surface for certain reactions and
              specifically for hydroisomerization.  The design paradigm calls for a small
              amount of a noble metal (palladium, platinum, rhodium, or iridium) that can
              dissociate hydrogen, which then spills over to an alloy surface with high
              selectivity for the desired product; these alloys consist of a base metal (iron
              or cobalt) and a rare earth (cerium, praseodynium, or lanthanum).  Other
              studies suggest that carbon supports may favor formation of surfaces with the
              desired structures; supports studied in this work include both high
              surface-area and low-surface area carbon, graphite, alumina, and silica.  
              Preliminary studies using iron-cerium-palladium on carbon show both high
              activity and high selectivity for hydroisomerization of 1-butene.  In this work
              partial hydrogenation of butadiene is used as an additional test reaction. 
              Surface and bulk structures of the particles are probed using  X-ray
              diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy, microcalorimetry, and transmission
              electron microscopy.    The principal being established in this work should
              apply to a wide range of industrial processes.  The specific systems under
              study will permit immediate application to the production of  "reformulated"
              gasoline required by the Clean Air Act and should eliminate the cost
              differential associated with compliance.  ***
