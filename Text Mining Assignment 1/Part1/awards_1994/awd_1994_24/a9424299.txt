Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
              help the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Louisville acquire a 300
              MHz NMR spectrometer.   The research activities to be supported include:  (1) 
              Sulfur-Centered Chemistry in Metal-  Sulfur Complexes; (2) Cage Formation in
              Organophosphonates of Aluminum, Gallium, and  Indium; (3) Synthesis and
              Confirmation of Oligosaccharides of Bacteria; (4) 1H NMR  Studies on
              Paramagnetic FeIIFeIII and FeIIICoII Iron-Oxo Complexes of Polyimidazole 
              Ligands; (5) Synthesis and Characterization of CO2-Bridged Bimetallic
              Complexes; and (6)  the molecular basis of carcinogenesis, solution structures
              of peptide receptors, the synthesis  NMR Studies on Peptides and
              Pseudopeptides.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.  It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR 
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. 
              The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers
              and catalysis, and in biology.2
