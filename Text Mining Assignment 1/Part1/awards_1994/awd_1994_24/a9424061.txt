Abstract    :
              9424061  Eisenberg   The REU Site will provide mentored research experiences for
              ten undergraduate interns within the context of ongoing research programs in
              the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University.  These ongoing
              projects span a wide range of research activities representative of Biomedical
              Engineering and include both modeling/simulation and experimental work.  The
              REU intern will work on their individual projects as members of research teams
              in the laboratories of the participating investigators.  All interns will be
              exposed to the entire spectrum of research activities included in this proposal
              through joint weekly meetings in which the interns discuss their work with each
              other.  These sessions will also be used to provide a forum for presentations
              and group discussions about a variety of topics intended to supplement the
              research experiences and encourage the interns to pursue graduate training in
              Biomedical Engineering.  An orientation at the beginning of the program will
              introduce the interns to the undergraduate research experiences and help
              familiarize the participants with the process of initiating independent inquiry
              in which there are a number of degrees of freedom in the methods chosen and the
              outcomes obtained.  Oral and written technical communication skills will also
              be introduced.  The goal of the REU Site program in Biomedical Engineering is
              to create an environment and culture to encourage the undergraduate
              participants to pursue research careers in Biomedical Engineering by exposing
              them to the intellectual challenge and excitements of independent inquiry.  ***
