Abstract    :
              9424515  Haimes  The Seventh Workshop on "Risk-Based Decision Making in Water 
              Resources" will take place at the Engineering Foundation  Facilities in Santa
              Barbara, California, on October, 1995.  Discussion sessions will be organized
              around the following  topics: basic evaluation/decision issues; hazard
              assessment  information; risk of extreme and catastrophic events; 
              uncertainties in data, models, forecasts and their influence  on analysis; risk
              associated with hazardous waste; range of  alternatives; system performance
              reliability; risk analysis  framework (benefit-cost, multiobjective) and its
              influence  on analysis; models, display techniques to aid evaluation  and
              reflect risk preferences.  The results from the workshop  will recommend new
              and needed research topics in the area of  risk and decision-making in water
              resources management and  the publication of the proceedings will be the next
              volume  of a series of seminal books on this topic.  ***
