Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site in
              Political Science through SUNY, Stony Brook.  The project provides the
              opportunity for eight undergraduate students to be immersed into an active
              research environment spanning topics from the demise of consensual norms on the
              U.S. Supreme Court to the propensity of nations to wage war as a function of
              their prior war experience.  The students will work as apprentices under the
              close supervision of faculty mentors and experienced graduate students.  The
              goal is to introduce students to the latest, state-of-the-art equipment and
              methodological techniques.  Also, students will be introduced to ethical
              aspects of scientific research through a series of six seminars focusing on
              current ethical questions in social research.  In addition to the research
              experience, participants will receive academic counseling and have access to a
              variety of support services.  This award contributes to the Foundation's
              continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
              active undergraduate research experiences.
