Abstract    :
              9424028  Whitney      The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral 
              Fellows Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to  conduct three to
              twenty-four months of research abroad. The  program's awards provide
              opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary
              facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will
              support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. James Andrew Whitney
              to work with Professor  Thomas Erhard Kreis at the University of Geneva in 
              Switzerland.    One of the defining features of eukaryotic cells is the  system
              of membrane-enclosed organelles through which newly  synthesized secretory
              proteins pass on their way to the cell  surface.  The transfer of membrane and
              secretory proteins  between these organelles typically involves the formation
              of  distinct populations of transport vesicles.  Understanding  the molecular
              mechanisms of these transport events has  become one of the most important
              problems in molecular cell  biology.  The primary goal  of the work proposed
              here is to  learn more about the molecular mechanisms involved in the 
              selective budding of vesicles in the secretory pathway.  In  particular, the PI
              will use relatively new in vivo imaging  techniques to follow the dynamic
              distribution of cytosolic  proteins thought to play a role in this process. ***
