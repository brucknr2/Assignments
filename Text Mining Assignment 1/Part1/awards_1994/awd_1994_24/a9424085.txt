Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V POINT SUR, a
              135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the University. 
              Instrumentation requested includes computer and network hardware, and Ashtech
              3-DF GPS system, and meteorological sensors.  The instrumentation requested is
              required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the POINT SUR during 1995 and
              will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.      ??
