Abstract    :
              9424462  Bannon  This research project involves an investigation of the role of
              boundary layer processes in the  formation, structure and propagation of
              surface fronts.  The low level structure of the front  includes the vorticity
              and convergence fields as well as the frontal updraft.  Their relative 
              positions help to determine the rate of frontogenesis and the strength and
              speed of the front.         The principal investigator will employ a variety of
              tools in the study.  A diagnostic  geostrophic momentum model of the baroclinic
              boundary layer will be used to study the effects  of baroclinicity, transience,
              advection, and stratification.  A prognostic model will be used to  conduct
              numerical experiments designed to elucidate the roles of surface friction and
              surface  hear fluxes on the front.  Finally, analyses of data from the
              Storm-scale Operational and  Research Meteorology-Fronts Experiment Systems
              Test (STORM-FEST) field program to  document observed mesoscale and microscale
              frontal structure and compare it with model  results.         Understanding the
              processes affecting the behavior of atmospheric fronts is an important  aspect
              of efforts to improve weather forecasting.  ***
