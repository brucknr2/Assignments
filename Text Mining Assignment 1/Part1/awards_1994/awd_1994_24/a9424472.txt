Abstract    :
              9424472  Ediger  The local segmental dynamics of a given chain are determined 
              by chemical structure, intramolecular potentials, and the  chain's environment.
               Optical experiments, NMR experiments,  and molecular dynamics computer
              simulations will be  performed to investigate these aspects of local dynamics
              in  polymer solutions, melts, blends, and glasses.  One project  will utilize
              molecular dynamics computer simulations to  investigate whether Tg is related
              to the extent of  cooperative motion which occurs in response to a 
              conformational transition.  Simulations are an ideal tool to  understand the
              microscopic features of local polymer motion  when they are tested by
              experiments which allow an  assessment of realism.  A second project will use a
              recently  developed photobleaching technique to explore the molecular  origins
              of physical aging.  Physical aging causes  degradation of the properties of
              glassy polymers over time.  These experiments will also help to unravel the
              fundamental  nature of the glass transition in polymers.  A third project  will
              use low-field NMR spectroscopy to study how the two  components of a polymer
              blend influence each other's local  dynamics.  These influences determine the
              mechanical  properties of the blend.  Ultimately, a prediction of blend 
              properties from component properties may be feasible.  %%%  Local polymer
              dynamics play an important role in the  structure/property relationships of
              amorphous polymers.  Local dynamics are directly responsible for a number of 
              important polymer properties such as the glass transition  temperature and the
              temperature dependence of the viscosity.  A fundamental understanding of local
              polymer dynamics may  allow the modification of existing materials to enhance 
              specific properties and possibly the development of new  materials.  ***
