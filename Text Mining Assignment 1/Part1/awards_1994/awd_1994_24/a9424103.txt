Abstract    :
              9424103  Jackson  Through this award, the Directorate for Biological Sciences
              and the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program of the Directorate for
              Education and Human Resources award will provide support for an innovative
              summer program that targets students from two year colleges, a student
              population that typically does not participate in REU-sites programs.  During
              the first two summers, participants will be extensively trained in various
              techniques used commonly in molecular biology and biotechnology research at the
              Massachusetts Bay Community College in Wellesley Hills, MA.  During the third
              summer, participants will use this technical knowledge to pursue independent
              research at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA or the Science
              Park biotechnology center in New Haven, CT.  The aim of the program is to equip
              students with the confidence and experience necessary to enter and complete
              post-baccalaureate training in science.  ***
