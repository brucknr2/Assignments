Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. Richard Saykally of the Department of Chemistry of the   University of
              California at Berkeley will engage in continuing studies of   the structure and
              dynamics of weakly bound molecular complexes.  Special   emphasis is paid to
              the dynamical aspects.  The experimental data will be   obtained by ultra high
              resolution laser spectroscopy and their analysis   will be accompanied by
              rigorous theoretical modeling  in order to obtain   highly detailed
              intermolecular potential energy surfaces.  Specifically,   the data from which
              this information is extracted are   vibration-rotation-tunneling  (VRT)
              spectra.  Extensions to hydrated   proton complexes and amino acid complexes
              will be made possible by   continued developments in the technology of VRT
              spectroscopy.  Since   intramolecular interactions are known to be
              non-additive, the emphasis   will be on trimer and higher order complexes.   
              The structure and dynamics of condensed phase matter, other than metals   and
              semiconductors, is largely determined by the weak interactions   between
              strongly bound molecules.  This research serves to obtain a   better molecular
              level understanding of the intermolecular interactions   that govern the
              behavior of condensed phase systems, including those of   biological
              importance.
