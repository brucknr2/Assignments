Abstract    :
              Oden       The investigator and his colleagues organize an international 
              symposium on computational and applied mathematics.  The meeting  focuses on
              interdisciplinary approaches to problems arising in  mathematical modeling and
              computer simulations of major scientific  and engineering applications. 
              Conference topics include  large-scale scientific computing, parallel
              processing, numerical  methods, applications in biological and environmental
              studies,  materials science, mechanics, image processing, and engineering 
              analysis, design, and manufacturing.       Mathematical modeling, computer
              simulation, and computational  mathematics have had a revolutionary impact on
              how research is  done throughout science and engineering.  The conference
              explores  recent developments in applied mathematics and computation across  a
              wide variety of application areas.  The problems stuied are  important in
              manufacturing, materials, environment, global change,  and high-performance
              computing.
