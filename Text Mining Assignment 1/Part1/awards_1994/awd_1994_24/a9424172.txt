Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate  researchers in
              mathematics. The research at this site will be on  topics in experimental
              mathematics in areas such as algebra,  analysis, geometry, and topology. The
              program will run for eight   weeks. Graduate students as well as faculty
              members will be  involved in working with the undergraduate project teams.
