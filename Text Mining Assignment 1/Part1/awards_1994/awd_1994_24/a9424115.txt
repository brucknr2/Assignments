Abstract    :
              Professor Edwin L. Sibert at the Department of Chemistry, the University   of
              Wisconsin at Madison, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for the theoretical analysis of  
              vibration/rotation dynamics of polyatomic molecules in the gas phase. The  
              quantum mechanical studies which Prof. Sibert is undertaking are in three  
              areas. The first area focuses on highly excited states where assignment   of
              states is difficult due to a high degree of mixing of different   rotational
              and vibrational levels. The problems due to this mixing are   avoided by
              investigation of properties of ensembles rather than the study   of individual
              states. The other two projects are devoted to describing   spectroscopy and
              dynamics at transition states of chemical reactions.   The research which is
              being carried out under this grant is valuable for   the interpretation and
              assignment of molecular spectra. Further, the   understanding that is being
              given by the research on the behavior near   transition states of reactions is
              essential to obtain reaction rates and   to accurately predict the
              distributions of reaction products.
