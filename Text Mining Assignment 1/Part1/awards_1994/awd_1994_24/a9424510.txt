Abstract    :
              9424510  Casson  This is an award to renew support  of research being conducted
              under  NSF Grant No. 91-24510.  The  objective of this research is to 
              determine the significance in  environmental engineering practice  of the
              presence and viability of  the Human Immunodeficiency Virus  (HIV) in
              wastewatep and following  various stages of treatment.  The  overall objective
              of work during  the renewal period is to continue  investigation of the
              viability of  the HIV in aqueous media and to  determine the effectiveness of 
              disinfectants for its inactivation.  The project will involve cell-  associated
              HIV survivability  studies, continued development of  methods for concentration
              and  recovery of cell-associated HIV in  wastewater following various stages 
              of treatment, optimization of the  concentration and assay procedures  and
              improvement in the detection  limits for indigenous cell-free  HIV.    The
              survival characteristics of the  HIV under environmental stresses  have not
              been well-established.  While there is no present  indication that
              environmental media  into which the virus is discharged  have any role in
              spreading it from  infected to non-infected  individuals, the virus has been 
              shown to survive for significant  periods of time in environmental  media.  The
              results of this  research are expected to provide  the basis for any changes,
              if any  are found to be needed, in the  engineering design of collection 
              systems, treatment processes and  systems for management of wastes  containing
              significant amounts of  this virus in the context of its  survival
              characteristics and  potential infectivity.  ***
