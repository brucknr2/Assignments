Abstract    :
              9424137  Harrison  Serpentine outcrops in Northern California are ecological
              islands with a rich native flora. This study examines two related aspects of
              plant community structure on serpentine soils, with both immediate and general
              relevance for conservation biology. The first question is how plant community
              diversity is spatially structured on serpentine versus non-serpentine soils,
              and how this spatial structure is affected by patchiness and other attributes
              of serpentine. Spatial turnover in species composition will be compared between
              serpentine and non-serpentine substrates, and between patchy and continuous
              serpentine, while holding the size and spacing of sampling areas constant. This
              well be the first rigorous test of the role of patchiness versus distance alone
              in producing the spatial component of community diversity. To assess the roles
              of endemism and lack of invasion, the above analyses will be repeated excluding
              endemics and alien species, respectively. Species turnover between pairs of
              sites will be regressed on distance and environmental dissimilarity within each
              habitat type to further quantify spatial turnover and its causes.    The second
              question concerns biotic causes of patterns of diversity. Experiments will
              examine how the rates of key biotic interactions vary with the size and
              isolation of serpentine patches. Pollination and seed predation will be
              measured in two serpentine endemic plant species, along both natural and
              experimental gradients of patch isolation.    This study will illuminate both
              how best to conserve plant communities on serpentine soils in California, and
              the more general issue of how patchiness at several spatial scales affects the
              structure and function of ecological communities. This research becomes even
              more important as human activities gradually increase the rate and degree of
              fragmentation of natural systems.
