Abstract    :
                This awards supports summer research by undergraduates at  the Sevilleta Long
              Term Ecological Research (LTER) site of  the University of New Mexico. 
              Students will live at the  Sevilleta LTER during the 12-week summer program
              while  pursuing research problems related to ongoing research at  the LTER. 
              Sample areas of research include 1) investigation  of the role of genetic and
              physiological variation in  abundance and distribution of  cottonwood trees
              along the  Rio Grande, and 2) response of desert grassland ecological 
              processes to rodent removal.  Students will attend seminars  and participation
              in other group activities that will  include discussions of the research
              process, of scientific  ethics, and of teaching.  Communication of research
              results  will  also be emphasized.
