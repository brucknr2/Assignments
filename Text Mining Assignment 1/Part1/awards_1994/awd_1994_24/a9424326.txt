Abstract    :
              Support from this grant will help to defray the expenses of US scholars to
              travel to Leuven, Belgium to attend the July 19-23 meeting of the International
              Society for the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology (ISHPSSB). 
              This meeting, the seventh biennial meeting of the society, is the first meeting
              of the society to be held outside North America.    ISHPSSB has come in the
              course of its twelve year history to be the primary setting for historians,
              philosophers and social scientists of biology to interact with one another and
              with practicing biologists on issues of common, professional interest.  Past
              meetings of the society have been highly stimulating and fruitful.  Invaluable
              scholarly contacts and interchanges have developed from conference sessions. 
              1995 is a propitious time for this society to hold its first European meeting
              given that  25% of the participants at previous meetings have been coming from
              outside North America; that significant work in these fields is advancing apace
              at various European centers; and that the last several years have witnessed new
              national societies established in Europe for the study of biology from
              historical, philosophical and social scientific perspectives.    These travel
              funds are being used to assist graduate students and independent scholars in
              attending the 1995 meeting.  Funding is being limited to those with official
              participation in the program:  presenting papers, delivering commentaries,
              and/or chairing sessions.  Grant recipients are being selected by a travel
              grants award committee.  Grants are being administered through the History of
              Science Society.
