Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to resolve kilometer scale waves in bottomside  equatorial
              spread F scattering layers using long baseline  interferometric imaging at
              Jicamarca.  Since the main beam of the  Jicamarca antenna is too wide to
              resolve ionospheric interchange  instability, the PIs will employ an imaging
              interferometry  technique to observe kilometer scale waves.  The Jicamarca
              antenna  array will be have a new module, located at some distance from the 
              others.  The investigators will also investigate the full nonlocal,  nonlinear
              theory of intermediate-scale plasma waves in spread F to  determine the cause
              of pronounced km scale structures in spread F  disturbances.  Finally, they
              will develop a fluid computer  simulation of the structures with radar
              imaging.***
