Abstract    :
              9450279  Brazin    The Exploratorium Teachers Institute proposes to develop,
              test, and  distribute three multicultural science and mathematics monographs 
              for use in middle and high school classrooms.  After extensive  classroom
              testing, the three monographs will be revised and  combined into one book for
              national dissemination.  These  publications will (1) present science and
              mathematics through tools  and designs from a variety of world cultures, and
              (2) provide  related hands-on, investigatory activities for students.  The 
              philosophy and format of the publications will be based on the  successful
              Exploratorium Science Snackbook.  The initial  publications will be
              self-published and distributed.  A revised  product, based upon feedback from
              initial users, will be published  commercially.  The proposed publications are
              designed to increase  awareness of multicultural issues for all students, while
              making  science more relevant and approachable to students of color.
