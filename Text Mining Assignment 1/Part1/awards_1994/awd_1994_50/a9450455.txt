Abstract    :
              9450455  The proposed research would consist of two parts. The first part 
              consists of NMR studies of cyclopropyl conjugation, for comparing  the electron
              donating abilities of the three membered ring,  double bond and phenyl group.
              The second part consists of a study  of conformation and bonding in ureas,
              thioureas and related  compounds using NMR spectroscopy and molecular orbits 
              calculations. These projects will make extensive use of NMR  spectroscopy and
              computational methods and will provide minority  students with experience in
              using both methods of assigning  conformation and structure.
