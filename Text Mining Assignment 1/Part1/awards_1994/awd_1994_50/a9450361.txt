Abstract    :
              9450361  Leitzell                   A workshop at the University of Nebraska,
              Lincoln, on June  2-4, 1994, is open to teams of faculty from regional 
              institutions with pre-service teacher preparation programs.  All teacher
              preparation institutions in the nine state area  of Nebraska, Colorado, South
              Dakota, Montana, Iowa,  Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, and Wyoming are invited to
              send  teams of four faculty, with at least one in mathematics and  one in
              mathematics education; other members of the team may  represent these areas or
              be administrators with interest in  pre-service preparation of teachers of
              mathematics.   Sessions of the workshop address the various roles  mathematics
              teacher educators play in moving toward systemic  change in mathematics
              education.  Of particular emphasis,  both in selecting participants and in
              organizing the content  of the sessions, is the joint responsibility
              mathematical  sciences and mathematics education faculty share in the pre- 
              service and continuing mathematical education of teachers of  school
              mathematics.  Working together these teacher  educators can reshape in a
              powerful way the undergraduate  curriculum in mathematics and have a strong
              impact on state  policies regarding initial certification, the development of 
              frameworks, and programs for additional endorsements.  Mathematics teacher
              educators also need to play more visible  roles in Statewide Systemic
              Initiatives efforts, State  Coalitions sponsored by the Mathematical Sciences
              Education  Board, and state affiliates of national professional  associations. 
              Workshop sessions feature speakers as well as working groups  of institutional
              teams.  Speakers and advisory committee  members will be available as
              consultants.  Participants  develop a set of planned activities to be
              undertaken during  the 1994-1995 academic year.  During late spring and summer 
              of 1995, the outcomes from these activities will be  collected, compiled, and
              disseminated to all participants  and others interested in the revitaliza tion
              of undergraduate  mathematics education.  ***
