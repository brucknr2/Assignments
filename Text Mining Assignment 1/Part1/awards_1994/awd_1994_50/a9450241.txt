Abstract    :

              This project intends to develop two multimedia instructional  program in the
              environmental sciences that relate to issues in the  community.  These programs
              are entitled The Case of the Leaking  Substance and Oil and Water.  The first
              of these two programs is  based on leaking fuel storage tanks in a fictitious
              low-income  neighborhood which is polluted by leaking petrochemical storage 
              tanks.  The program is to consist of a videodisc case study, hands-  on
              activities, discussions, and laboratory activities.  The second  program is to
              investigate various factors that affect the level of  soil and ground water
              pollution near leaking fuel storage  facilities.  Both programs can be used
              separately or together in an  integrated format.  Print-based materials are to
              include a student  edition of laboratory activities, notes, selected readings
              and  databases of resources needed for the activities and a teachers  edition
              which supports the programs and provides assessment items.  ***
