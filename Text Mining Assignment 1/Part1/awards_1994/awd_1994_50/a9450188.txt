Abstract    :
              Dr. Anne Milbrooke will conduct research and write a biography.   Her topic is
              Frederick B. Rentschler (1887-1956), an influential  manufacturer of aviation
              equipment from 1919 to 1956.  She will  investigate what Rentschler did, the
              environment in which he acted,  the people with whom he interacted, the reasons
              given for his  actions, and the effects of his actions.  Among the themes she
              will  explore are the relationships among individual and institution, 
              management and manufacturing, engineering and innovation,  corporation and
              Congress, and aviation and American society.      Rentschler's story begins
              with his early industrial background in  Hamilton, Ohio, and his transition to
              aviation through Army  assignments during World War I and subsequent
              appointments at the  Wright Aeronautical Corporation.  In 1925 he founded the
              Pratt &  Whitney Aircraft Company, and a few years later he joined William  E.
              Boeing in organizing United Aircraft & Transport Corporation.   In 1934
              Rentschler organized United Aircraft Corporation.  From  corporate headquarters
              he managed the Pratt & Whitney, Chance  Vought, Hamilton Standard, and Sikorsky
              manufacturing divisions.   He dealt with military customers and the Congress
              that also had  commercial customers.  Rentschler was chairman of United
              Aircraft  Corporation until his death in 1956.    Interactive activities over a
              two-year period include:  teaching  courses entitled "Women in Science and
              Technology," "The American  Century of Science and Technology," and "Made in
              the USA - a  History of Manufacturing.  Dr. Milbrooke will present seminars on 
              her research.
