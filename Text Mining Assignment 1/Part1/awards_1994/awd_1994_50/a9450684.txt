Abstract    :
              9450684  Wink  The faculty in the department of chemistry at Chicago State 
              University (CSU), William Rainey Harper College (HC) and the   University of
              Illinois at Chicago (UIC) will join in a  consortium to create, share, and
              evaluate curriculum changes in  chemistry and related areas.  Their efforts
              build upon networks  already established for the purposes of curriculum reform.
                This new Consortium will create versatile, multi-faceted, and  well-tested
              options for implementation at peer institutions.   Each institution is
              responsible for the independent generation  of one or more comprehensive
              curricula that will be implemented  on their campus and later on the campus of
              one of the other  Consortia members.  CSU faculty will initially focus on a 
              two-year combined physical sciences and mathematics program.   HC faculty will
              initially focus on a two-year combined physical  sciences and mathematics
              program.  HC faculty will address both  the general and organic sequences and
              non-major courses.  UIC  faculty will work on projects related to introductory 
              chemistry, chemistry for engineers, and upper division courses.   The personnel
              will also collaborate from the inception of the  program on two  inter-campus
              projects, The Data Project and The  Chemistry Hook, designed to create a
              general set of materials  to introduce research and life-related examples into
              chemistry  courses.  An annual symposium on science education issues will  also
              be sponsored by the Consortium.  ***y
