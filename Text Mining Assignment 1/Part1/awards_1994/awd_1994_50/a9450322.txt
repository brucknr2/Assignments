Abstract    :
              9450322  The proposed research would identify differentially expressed  genes in
              the periderm of the sweet potato storage roots, isolate  its regulatory
              sequences and characterize the promoter element.  The proposed research would
              contribute to our knowledge of  tissue-specific gene expression and control in
              plants. Isolation  of promoters which express genes differentially in the
              periderm  would be of immediate practical use in genetic engineering of  sweet
              potato for disease and pest resistance.
