Abstract    :
              9450412  The proposed research encompasses the synthesis of pseudo-ternary 
              compounds of the silver chalcogenides and the characterization  and simulation
              of their physical and electrical properties. The  ultimate aim is to relate
              structural information to the ionic  conductivity and diffusivity of silver to
              obtain a deeper  understanding of the mechanism of superionic conductivity
              which  marks high temperature phases in the system Ag2S---Ag2Se--Ag2 Te.  Data
              sets derived from x-ray diffraction,calorimetry, four-probe  conductivity and
              x-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses will be  incorporated into a computer
              model of the super ionic phases.
