Abstract    :
              9450917  Allen                                                     The
              Department of Computer Science at Furman University proposes a  Multimedia
              Teaching Laboratory to support its undergraduate  introductory service course
              CS16, Introduction to Computing. In  addition to five hours of weekly lecture
              material, CS16 students  participate in a two hour weekly lab. The practical
              experience  gained in the laboratory activities is an essential component of 
              the course. The proposed laboratory would be used for the  development and
              implement of new course lab activities.  Currently  the department is revising
              the course's content to integrate  multimedia computing, data visualization,
              and networking concepts.  A basic understanding of these concepts is essential
              for our  graduates who enter careers in science, industry, education, 
              government, and the professions. All of these fields will  experience
              significant changes as a result of the rapid growth of  digital information
              technologies. This curriculum development  effort represents a significant
              upgrading of the traditional  undergraduate literacy course in computing.
              Consequently, it serves  as a potential model for other computer science
              departments who are  seeking ways to make this "bread and butter" service
              course more  relevant, more exciting, and more useful for their students. We 
              expect to publish course materials (a textbook with accompanying  disk
              containing laboratory activities is already under contract) to  enhance this
              potential.
