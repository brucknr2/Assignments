Abstract    :
              Abstract 556  Cha  Microwave-Induced Coal Gasification for Production of
              Activated  Coke and Synthesis Gas    The project's overall objective is to
              perform exploratory  research that supports industry for the development of an 
              advanced coal gasification process that utilizes Wyoming natural  resources and
              also to establish faculty and student exchange  programs with the industry.  To
              achieve these program objectives,  the program consists of two tasks.  Task 1
              covers fundamental  research to investigate microwave-induced reactions
              involved in  coal gasification.  Task 2 provides activities to establish a 
              cooperative research and a co-op program for undergraduate and  graduate
              students with the DOW Chemical Company and the FMC  Corporation.    The
              experimental results obtained from Task 1, exploratory  research, will assist
              the industry in developing a simple, clean,  and economic process for the
              removal of NOx, SOx, and other  pollutants from the flue gas.  Successful
              development of a  microwave-induced coal gasification process will
              significantly  reduce the price of activated coke, and will eventually lead to 
              reducing the overall cost of pollution control. An efficient,  economic, and
              environmentally-friendly process for the production  of activated coke will
              improve the economy of Wyoming along with  an increase in employment in
              Wyoming.  Task 2 will offer three  undergraduate students and one graduate
              student practical  training and industrial experience that will assist them in
              their  search for permanent employment after graduation.  An ongoing  joint
              research program among the University of Wyoming, DOW, and  FMC will also
              result.
