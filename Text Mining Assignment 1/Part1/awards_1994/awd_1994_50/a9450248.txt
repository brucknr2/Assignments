Abstract    :
              9450248  Pearlman    This project involves students actively in mathematical
              problem  solving suing real-time weather data and on-line computer  technology.
               Supplementary units for the middle school mathematics  curriculum four to six
              weeks in length are being developed.  The  units are to be cross-disciplinary;
              involving map-reading,  geography, social studies, physics, and mathematics. 
              Mathematical  topics include discerning patterns. making conjectures, 
              communicating mathematics, analyzing numerical and graphical data,  measuring,
              symbolizing and the using scales.
