Abstract    :
              9450475  The proposed research would conduct fundamental studies to  elucidate
              the biochemical interactions of bacterial and mammalian  cell lines with model
              synthetic organic surfaces. Studies will be  carried out that will allow an
              investigation of the origins of  biomolecular adsorption of chemical and
              physical changes that  lead to the attachment of cells and microbes to
              synthetic  materials. A facility would be established for the study and 
              development of materials for prosthetic, bioanalytical and  biotechnological
              applications.
