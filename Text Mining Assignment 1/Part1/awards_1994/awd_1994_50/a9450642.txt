Abstract    :
              9450642  Kovac                                                                  
                      Our curriculum proposal emphasizes the continuity of chemistry.  We 
              imagine the curriculum as a highly-structured minimal core  embellished with
              electives.  Throughout the curriculum we will  emphasize the major themes of
              characterization of chemical systems  and chemical reactions and dynamics. 
              Within those themes,  important topics such as equilibrium and periodicity will
              also be   developed.  In the lower-division core we intend to teach the 
              material in such a way that it will not have to be retaught in  later courses. 
              Mastery-learning concepts will aid in this effort.   The laboratory will be
              thoroughly integrated into the courses with  chemicals returned to the center
              of the curriculum.  Modern  educational technology will be utilized wherever
              possible.  We will   use the twin themes of history and ethics to emphasize
              that  chemistry is also a branch of the liberal arts.  Our goal is to  produce
              an innovative curriculum which our colleagues around the  country will be eager
              to implement.
