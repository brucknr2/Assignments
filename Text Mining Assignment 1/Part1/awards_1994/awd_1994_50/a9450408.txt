Abstract    :
              SSC-9450408  Johnson C. Smith University  Charlotte, NC  Dias, Benjamin and
              Appovoo Perumal    "Summer Science Camp"    Johnson C. Smith University plans a
              four-week intensive residential  Summer Science Camp and a monthly Saturday
              component for 50  seventh, eighth, and ninth grade minority students for the
              three  year period 1994-1997.  The program focuses on classroom and field 
              activities in biology, chemistry, computer science, physics,  mathematics, and
              problem-solving.  Activities invovle the  Scientific Method as students make
              observations, collect and  analyze data, and draw conclusions.  Field
              experiences involve  visits to industry, government labs, and science museums. 
              Group  meetings with minortiy scientists, engineers, and teachers, are  planned
              to promote careers which are mathematics and science based.    Participants
              will also be encouraged to consider teaching as one of  their career choices. 
              The Saturday component is designed for  further mentoring, follow-up
              activities, and for students to  continue working on their summer projects. 
              The program encourages  students to enroll in mathematics and science in school
              and to be  successful.  In so doing, we seek to address the need for a 
              scientifically literate society, and to help reverse the declining 
              achievement, interest, and participation by minority students in  science and
              mathematics.
