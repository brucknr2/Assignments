Abstract    :
              9450921  Shaw  Rio Salado Community College has purchased microcomputer hardware
               and software to enhance faculty and student support in Science and  Math
              courses through the use of microcomputer-based laboratory  teaching and
              learning systems.  Serving primarily female (64 %), 
              single-headed-of-households, and by utilizing a multi-disciplinary,  integrated
              curriculum model which allows Science and Math students  access to experiments
              which do not currently exist due to space and  funding limitations, Rio Salado
              improves the chances of such  students continuing their education in Science
              and Math and  provides a continuing educational experience outside the 
              "traditional" classroom site through modemed instruction and  tutoring during
              "non-classroom" hours.  Rio Salado assists science  students through
              computer-aided classroom instruction and  interactive computer laboratory
              simulations utilizing existing  software packages and electronic networks.
