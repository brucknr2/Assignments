Abstract    :
              Dr. Renee Diehl's research involves the study of structures,  dynamics and phase
              transitions in overlayers of alkali metals on  metal and graphite surfaces. 
              The main technique to be employed in  this study is He-atom scattering (HAS),
              and experiments will be  carried out in the laboratory of Professor R. B. Doak
              on a state-  of-the-art apparatus.  The main purposes of these experiments are 
              to study the He-atom interaction with alkali surfaces, to study the  dynamics
              of the alkali metal bond to metal surfaces as a function  of alkali metal
              coverage, and to study the lattice dynamics of  thick alkali metal films.  The
              goal is to increase the  understanding of simple metal adsorbates, simple metal
              surfaces and  how He atoms couple to them.  Exploratory experiments will also
              be  carried out using low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) on graphite 
              interacalation in the laboratory of Professor I. Tsong.  These  experiments
              should provide new information on the microscopic  process and kinetics of
              alkali metal intercalation into graphite.    Interactive activities to be
              carried out include:  teaching a  graduate level course in surface physics;
              initiating and organzing  a high-profile seminar program which will bring women
              scientists  and engineers from all over the US to speak at Arizona State 
              University; and planning a women in physics colloquim series aimed  at
              increasing the visibility of women physicists, particularly ones  who are in
              their early careers and who will benefit most from the  exposure.  Lunchtime
              meetings of women in physics and related  disciplines will be initiated in
              order to discuss research  interests and issues such as climate, families, and
              employment  prospects.
