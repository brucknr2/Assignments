Abstract    :
              9450592  Kimmel    This New Jersey Institute of Technology FEMME Continuum
              project will serve post fifth and  sixth grade girls who are Intro to FEMME
              alumnae.  The partners in this project are the Newark  Museum, the New Jersey
              Marine Science Consortium and Liberty Science Center.  The non-  residential
              program will be comprised of five academic year workshops conducted during the 
              spring semester of 1995, a four-week summer component to be held during July of
              1995, and  a follow-up session in September 1995.  Instruction will be provided
              in science, math and  engineering, as well as oral and written communication
              skills.  Continuing experiences will be  provided through follow-up site visits
              to:  the Pocono Environmental Education Center in  Dingman's Ferry,
              Pennsylvania; the Marine Science Consortium in Sandy Hook, New Jersey;  the
              Newark Museum and the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey.  In
              addition,  the student participants will receive academic and career
              counseling, and will continue to  interact, both formally and informally, with
              female professionals engaged in SEM careers,  including faculty, as well as
              with university students.      Participants will be involved in daily
              structured athletic events to encourage teamwork and  cooperative efforts. 
              Existing study groups will continue to foster cooperative learning habits in 
              the investigation of scientific, math and engineering concepts.  Program staff
              will include three  female elementary school teachers and three female high
              school math/science teachers, and NJIT  SEM faculty.  The pre-college teachers
              will form teams composed of an elementary teacher and  a high school teacher to
              work with the students.  A program coordinator will work part-time  during the
              1995 spring semester and full time for five weeks in the summer.  All
              participants  will be provided with information and applications for other
              summer precollege enrichment  programs in SEM following completion of this
              program.  ***
