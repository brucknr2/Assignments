              Garner and Janet Lanza    "JR-TEAMS (Joint Research & Teaching for Aspiring
              Minorities in  Science)    The University of Arkansas at Little Rock College of
              Science and  Engineering Technology will offer a four-week summer program for 
              minority junior high students who have an interest and aptitude for  science,
              engineering and mathematics (SEM).  This commuter program  will be conducted
              during the first year on the weekdays beginning  June 6, 1994 through July 1,
              1994.  The goal of this program is to  increase the number of minority students
              from the Central Arkansas  area who prepare themselves in secondary schools to
              pursue and  successfully complete the study of science and engineering at the 
              university level and pursue SEM careers.  Mentors, role models,  interaction
              with TEAMS, and field trips will be an integral part of  JR-TEAMS.    ***
