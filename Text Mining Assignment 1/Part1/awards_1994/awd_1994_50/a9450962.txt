Abstract    :
              9450962  Murnane  We propose to develop a new laboratory course within the
              Physics  Department at Washington State University, titled "Applications of 
              Optics." This course, which will complement two other  upper-division
              laboratory courses, will give students a broad  background in experimental
              optics. Its goal will be to acquaint  students with the real-world consequences
              of fundamental optical  phenomena, and to expose the students to applications
              of optics in  physics, chemistry, and engineering. The laboratory will be based
               on a femtosecond laser facility, which will enable us to translate  recent
              results from our research lab at WSU into the undergraduate  curriculum, where
              it will be used to better illustrate concepts of  coherence, dispersion,
              nonlinear optics and fundamentals of quantum  mechanics.  For these
              applications we will develop a completely  novel set of experiments with
              femtosecond lasers for undergraduate  laboratories.
