Abstract    :
              9450998  Pervine                              Murray State University is
              establishing a computer laboratory for  students enrolled in multivariable
              calculus, numerical analysis,  mathematical modeling and applied statistics.
              The laboratory  consists of a network of UNIX-based workstations serving as a 
              platform for Mathematica, SAS, FORTRAN, and C. Students presently  enter these
              courses having taken computer-enhanced calculus, linear  algebra, and
              differential equations courses. These students have  begun to develop their
              problem-solving skills and started to  develop some mathematical insight.
              Students  participating in this  project are continuing their mathematical
              development. They are  building and analyzing mathematical models, carrying out
              analysis  of data, and learning how to apply modern numerical methods to 
              realistic and open-ended problems. This process, which includes 
              experimentation, searching for patterns, and making conjectures is  helping
              students refine their problem-solving skills and gain a  deeper understanding
              of mathematical principles.
