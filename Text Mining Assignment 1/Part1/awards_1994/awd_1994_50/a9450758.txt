                   Through this project, a coalition of two and four year colleges and 
              universities in Puerto Rico are changing the way calculus is  taught. In
              addition to preparing faculty to use the Core Calculus  Curriculum materials,
              the project is promoting and assessing the  use of collaborative learning
              techniques with the Hispanic student  population. The materials produced as
              well as the assessment of  student achievement will also be of value to
              universities with  large Hispanic populations.
