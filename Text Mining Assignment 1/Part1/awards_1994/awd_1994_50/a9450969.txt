Abstract    :
              9450969  Larsen  This project supports new entomology laboratory courses for 
              majors and non-majors with an emphasis on experimental  approaches. The courses
              are taught by a new faculty member in  the biology department with expertise in
              insect behavior and  ecology. The college has supported the initial development
              of  this program; however this project provides video microscopy,  insect
              rearing equipment, and other modern instrumentation. It  is expected that the
              project will improve the experimental  approach as well as the behavioral
              laboratory component in the  new entomology courses. Also, this equipment will
              support  directed entomological research performed by undergraduate  students
              at a small liberal arts college.  ***
