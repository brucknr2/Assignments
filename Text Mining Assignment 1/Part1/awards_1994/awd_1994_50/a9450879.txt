Abstract    :
              9450879  Walczak  The chemistry curriculum contains no modern electrochemical 
              experiments and very limited equipment to perform such  experiments. 
              Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical  (combining electrochemistry and
              spectroscopy) experiments are  important in both industrial and academic
              applications and the  equipment to do these types of experiments is standard at
              many  comparable colleges.  To maintain the excellence of the chemistry 
              department at St. Olaf College we propose to obtain the necessary  equipment to
              incorporate electrochemistry and  spectroelectrochemistry into Instrumental
              Analysis Laboratory  (Chem 378), Analytical Chemistry Laboratory (Chem 256),
              Physical  Chemistry Laboratory (Chem 257), and Advanced Synthesis  Laboratory
              (Chem 374).  The equipment would also be used in  student research, in
              conjunction with Chem 375, Chem 398 and our  summer research program.
