Abstract    :
              9450006  Sikes    This project, Bridging the Gap, is designed to empower local
              Girl  Scout volunteer facilitators and leaders to plan, organize, and  direct
              SEM activities at the grass roots level.  This will be done  by providing
              materials, resources, and training in SEM interest  areas and recognition
              programs.  The specific goals of the project  are (1) to increase the number of
              registered girls participating in  SEM activities presented in the Contemporary
              Issues booklet Into  the World of Today and Tomorrow, and in other recognition
              programs  included in the SEM interest area in Girl Scouting.  (2) to provide 
              training, materials, and support to Girl Scout Troop leaders so  that they can
              encourage girls in their troops to participate in SEM  activities; and (3) to
              establish a community support system at the  service unit level using the
              volunteer SEM facilitator to implement  SEM activities for girls at the local
              level.  Through a national  dissemination plan approximately 2,647,000 Girl
              Scouts in 332 Girl  Scout councils can be impacted.  ***
