Abstract    :
              9450676  Chapman  Economic change and new technology are driving educational 
              reform.  The transition from the Industrial Age to the  Information Age is
              causing great change in the institutions of  our society, and the universities
              and colleges are not exempt.   New technology--powerful computers,
              sophisticated client-server  systems, high-resolution  graphics for
              visualization,  multi-media, virtual reality, and broad-band fiber-optic cable 
              are transforming our economy and our society; they will alter  forever what we
              mean by "education."  An Alliance of the  University of California, Los Angeles
              (UCLA),  California State  University, Fullerton (CSUF), and twenty-four
              community  colleges in the greater Los Angeles area has worked together  for
              many years in improving chemistry instruction.  The  Alliance now requests
              funds to plan a proposal that will  reorganize content into a new molecular
              science curriculum and  make maximum use of new educational technology.  In
              preparing  this proposal our attention is focused on informing our  faculties,
              gaining broad faculty support, and achieving  consensus for action.  To achieve
              these goals, we propose four  planning grant activities.  First, we  will host
              a seminar that  features distinguished speakers in economics, technology, 
              curriculum reform, science philosophy, science education,  cognitive science,
              and educational innovation.  Second,  Professor Orville Chapman of UCLA will
              present a one-quarter  seminar course that defines the issues, presents the
              proposal,  and facilitates debate and discussion.  Third, members of the 
              planning group will travel to sites of technological  innovation.  Finally, we
              will have a two-day faculty retreat at  Lake Arrowhead to fine tune the new
              curriculum and plan for  action.  ***y
