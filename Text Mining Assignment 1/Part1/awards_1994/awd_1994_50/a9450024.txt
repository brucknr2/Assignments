Abstract    :
              9450024  George    This EPWG Project, Collaboration for Equity will make equity
              for girls and women, of all  colors, abilities, and backgrounds, a central
              rather than a marginal consideration in the efforts  to reform math and science
              education.  The American Association for the Advancement of  Science, Girls
              Incorporated, the Education Development Center, and others will use their 
              collective resources to work in partnership with organizations that can act as
              advocates for equity  and influence the reform efforts and the formal education
              system.  The objective of the initiative  are to (1) strategies with the
              initiators of systemic reform efforts to determine how to make  equity both a
              driving force an a measure of success; (2) to collaborate with the initiators
              and  implementors of systemic reform to translate hate equity means into
              concrete strategies and  activities; (3) to provide support and assistance for
              systemic reform organizations and equity-  based organizations to advocate
              effectively for equity in mathematics and science education  reform; and (4) to
              strengthen the equity community by building a common language for equity  in
              mathematics and science and addressing the issues that separate advocates for
              gender equity,  racial/ethnic equity, and disability equity.  ***
