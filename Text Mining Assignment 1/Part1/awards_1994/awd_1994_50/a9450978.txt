Abstract    :
              9450978  Narsavage  The objective of this proposal is to incorporate 
              thermalgravimetric analysis into the undergraduate polymer  chemistry lab and
              the required undergraduate student research  program at the University of
              Scranton.  The Chemistry Department  is in the process of establishing a
              Polymer Chemistry major which  will require two polymer chemistry courses and a
              polymer  chemistry lab.  Plans for the polymer lab are currently underway 
              since the course is scheduled to begin in the Spring of 1995.  Acquisition of a
              Perkin-Elmer Thermalgravimetric Analyzer TGA 7  and Thermal Analysis Controller
              TAC 7/DX will expand our current  thermal analysis capabilities and therefore
              allow our students to  gain significant and meaningful experience in the
              thermal  analysis of polymers.  The instrument is capable of multi-ramp 
              experiments with heating/cooling rate ranges from 0.1 to  200 C/min in 0.1 C
              increments to allow for kinetics experiments.   Since the instrument operates
              from ambient temperature to 1000 C,  the study of gel processing of high Tc
              superconductors and  polymers as precursors to ceramic materials will also be 
              possible.
