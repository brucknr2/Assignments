Abstract    :
              9450611  Chittenden                                                         The
              Arkansas Consortium of Chemistry Programs wishes to reorganize  their chemistry
              programs in parallel with the NSF-funded Arkansas  Statewide Systemic
              Initiative for the improvement of science  education, an initiative focused
              principally in the K-12 sector but  having 13-16 extensions.  The proposed
              study will have three  segments: the reorganization of the curriculum as a
              whole and of  specific courses within the  curriculum; attendant changes in the
               delivery of classroom instruction; and of laboratory instruction.   The
              production of new textual materials will follow from these  innovations.  The
              vehicle for promulgating curricular changes and  their delivery will be recent
              advances in computing and  communications.  We will study technologies such as:
               distance  learning using interactive uplink/downlink systems; computer 
              modelling and simulation; personal computer-based data  acquisition/analysis
              systems for teaching laboratories;  chemistry-related computational and drill
              software, video, and  interactive CD-ROM.  We propose to include broad,
              thematic elements  in our BS and BSE programs, statewide, in Chemistry and in
              related  programs: biology, engineering, pre-healing arts - pre-med,  pre-dent,
              pre-vet.  These common themes, stressed strongly in the  lower division
              courses, will be chosen after careful study of  existing and potential model
              curricula.  Particularly stressed will  be the theme that contemporary
              chemistry is conducted as a more  interdisciplinary enterprise than current
              compartmentalized  chemistry curricula would suggest.   ***
