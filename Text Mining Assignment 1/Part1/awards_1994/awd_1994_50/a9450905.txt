Abstract    :
              Students in a microbiology course required for non-majors from a  relatively
              large group of diverse curricula uses computer presented  case studies to
              understand the basic biology of microorganisms as  well as the applied aspects
              of microbiology used in his or her  career. The computer program presents a
              case study with digitized  images to provide realism. To solve a case, the
              student must  develop a hypothesis and test that hypothesis by interactively 
              seeking pertinent data from the computer. The data are obtained  when clinical
              tests are requested from a list of laboratory  procedures available. Students
              are penalized for asking for  irrelevant data because there is a "mock" charge
              for each test. The  student's final evaluation is based on a written report
              that gives  the reasoned arguments that led to the solution and the final 
              "cost" of solving the case.
