Abstract    :
              9450635  Pacey                                                                  
                      Through the development of a modular approach to chemistry and  relate
              sciences, we propose to address the following issues.   Students:  student pool
              is bifurcated into well-prepared and  ill-prepared "at-risk" students; students
              with interdisciplinary  interests must decide among traditional majors; science
              literacy  among the nonscience students is extremely low; student learning is 
              more visual, making the lecture format less effective.   Instruction:  rapid
              expansion of science has over-extended  curricular content ("more is good"
              philosophy); liberal education  needs preclude expansion of science
              requirements for majors;  research experiences are too focused at the senior
              level; the  divisional structure of Chemistry (and, to some extent, the 
              departmental structure of science) is inconsistent with the  practice of
              science.  Our premises are that:  a comprehensive  overhaul of chemistry
              instruction (both structural and content) is  needed; an incremental approach
              will not achieve the objectives of  improved instruction; inquiry-based
              instruction should replace the  content-based approach to many topics in order
              to better reflect  the practice of science; current curricula lead to wasteful 
              duplication of material, particularly among departments; curriculum  reform
              should be based on a top-down plan that emphasizes student  outcome in the
              development of the model.
