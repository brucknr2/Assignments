Abstract    :
              9450252  Rousso    Girls Incorporated, a national youth-serving organization, is
               undertaking a three year project to modify its highly successful  Operation
              SMART program, designed to address the underrepresenta-  tion of girls and
              women in science and mathematics, so that it is  accessible to girls and young
              women with diverse disabilities.    Recognizing that girls with disabilities
              face a double set of  barriers based on disability and gender to mathematics
              and science  experiences, courses and careers, the overall project goals is to 
              provide girls with disabilities with access to needed skills,  attitudes, and
              opportunities so that they will choose and can  persist in science and
              mathematics courses in school, and pursue  mathematics and science careers and
              interests in adult life.  A  secondary goal is to provide nondisabled girls
              with further  encouragement for scientific pursuits through exposure to an 
              enriched curriculum and a mainstreamed learning environment.    The project
              objectives are to:         Develop basic principles for incorporating the needs
              and  experiences of girls with diverse disabilities into science and 
              mathematics curricula;         Revise the materials and manuals of Operation
              SMART so they  are inclusive of girls with disabilities;         Assist other
              science and mathematics programs and curricula to  become inclusive of girls
              with disabilities.    Through field testing in several sites throughout the
              country, and  consultation with experts in the field, the project is developing
               a science curriculum on a specific set of topics from the ground up  to
              understand the basic principles of inclusion as it relates to  science, and the
              contributions of the experience of disability to  scientific exploration and
              learning.  These principles will then be  used to alter existing SMART
              curricula and materials, and have  significant input into materials now in
              process so that they are  truly inclusive, with the needs and experience of
              girls with  disabilities being thoroug hly integrated into the work rather than
               an add-on.  Finally, the project will generalize from the process  of revising
              SMART to develop guidelines for modifying other science  and mathematics
              curricula so they can be used in mainstreamed  settings.    Several products
              will be developed through this project including  a new curriculum, a set of
              modified SMART materials, a set of  guidelines for inclusion, and an annotated
              bibliography on  inclusive mathematics and science curricula.  These will be
              broadly  disseminated using the extensive Girls Incorporated networks.
