Abstract    :
              This research is an outgrowth of recent paleontological expeditions  to
              Madagascar.  The research include:         (1)  Functional anatomy of extinct
              lemurs, encompassing            descriptions and functional interpretations of
              previously            unknown carpal and pedal materials, vertebrae, and       
                  pelves.  The goals are reconstruction of positional            behavior of
              extinct lemurs, description of new species,            and analysis of patterns
              of long bone structural            adaptation.         (2)  Lemur evolutionary
              ontogeny.  Indroids (including the            giant extinct forms) have
              patterns of dental and somatic            growth that are exceedingly unusual
              for primates.             Available ontogenetic series will be examined and    
                     compared, using new analytical strategies.         (3)  Geographic
              variation, sexual variation and phylogeny of            lemurs.  A multivariate
              analysis of subfossil lemur            skeletal variation will be conducted and
              a taxonomic            revision of the lemurs will be undertaken, including    
                     phenetic and cladistic treatments of characters            previously
              studied only among extant lemurs.    Interactive activities include a course on
              "The Evolution of  Ontogeny" and a graduate seminar designed according to
              student  needs on topics such as:  problems in allometry, mathematical 
              modelling in evolutionary biology, sexual dimorphism, the evolution  and
              extinction of Malagasy primates.  In addition, guest lectures  will be offered
              with special emphasis on subfossil lemurs.
