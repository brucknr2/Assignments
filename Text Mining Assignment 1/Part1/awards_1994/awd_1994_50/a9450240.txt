Abstract    :
              9450240    Berenfeld    The Global Laboratory Curriculum provides an
              interdisciplinary, one-year course at the secondary level that supports science
              standards and school reform through intercultural, scientifically meaningful,
              collaborative student investigations in environmental studies.  Students are
              given the opportunity to experience all aspects of genuine scientific research:
              problem identification, background study, project design, collaboration, data
              acquisition and analysis, publication and defense.  The students begin with
              small experimental activities in the first semester and build toward a research
              project in the second.  The curriculum builds upon earlier Global Lab Projects
              which emphasized research activities at various grade levels.  The Student
              Research Guide of reference materials and  research techniques supports a wide
              range of activities and telecommunications.  The Teachers' Guide includes
              classroom management techniques, equipment information, lesson plans,
              assessment guidance and references to standards.  The Toolkit will supply a
              versatile set of instruments piloted in previous projects and also the Alice
              Network Software.  The Workshop package supports teachers to facilitate and
              lead student-based research.  The materials are pilot and field tested.
