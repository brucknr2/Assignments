Abstract    :
              SSC-9450289  Cal State U Hayward Fnd  Hayward, CA  Harper, Charlie    "Summer
              Physics Enrichment Camps (SPECS)"    Summer Physics Enrichment Camps (SPECS) is
              an SEM enrichment  program designed to serve 40 minority seventh graders and
              four  junior high school science teachers per year.  Twenty students and  two
              teachers from each of two school districts (Oakland and New  Haven) will
              participate in the 4-week residential summer camp and  academic-year follow-up
              activities.  The goals of SPECS are to  provide a foundation for a lifelong
              interest in SEM for  participants and to encourage the consideration of SEM as
              a  possible career.  Some specific objectives of SPECS are to (a)  strengthen
              students' commitment to remain in school and complete  their university
              entrance course requirements, (b) illustrate the  importance of SEM skills in
              our daily lives, and (c) offer students  information and guidance in the career
              exploration process.    SPECS seeks to reverse the pattern of minority students
              being  under-motivated and unprepared to consider science-based careers or  to
              enter higher education.  SPECS will provide students with (a)  residential
              experience on a university campus, (b) an opportunity  to explore science by
              use of hands-on and visual activities, (c)  mentors and role models who will
              encourage the students to pursue  higher education, (d) enhanced parental
              support for students'  pursuit of higher education, and (e) academic year
              activities and  guidance.  The success of the program will be evaluated by
              tracking  participants' scholastic achievements in high school and beyond and 
              by comparing this cohort to a non-participant group.  ***
