Abstract    :
              Two modalities of injury can result in wedge fractures of the  vertebrae: 
              atraumatic, osteoporotic fracture and seat-belt induced  fracture during
              vehicular frontal impact.  To reduce occurrence of  these fractures, enhanced
              knowledge of the fracture mechanisms and  determinants of vertebral strength is
              required.  The objective of  this research is to improve the current
              understanding of these  areas of biomechanics.    Ultrasound technology will be
              used to determine material properties  for developing finite element models of
              spinal functional units,  and the contributions of cortical and trabecular bone
              to vertebral  strength will be assessed.  Whole body and regional impact 
              experiments will be conducted to determine the correlation between  fracture
              mechanics and mechanical properties.  Computational and  experimental results
              will be compared for validation.    Interactive activities will include
              teaching a combined  undergraduate/graduate course in biomaterials during each
              of the  first two years and an advanced course in biomaterials the third  year.
               Additionally, seminars will be organized featuring experts  in bioengineering.
               About 50 percent of the speakers will be women  researchers.  Workshops will
              be organized and opportunities for  male and female students to visit research
              laboratories of women in  industry, hospitals, and other universities will be
              offered through  the Society of Women Engineers and ASME.
