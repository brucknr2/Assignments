Abstract    :
              9450531  Crissman    This Information Dissemination Activity, Kieve Science Camp
              for Girls:  A Laboratory Camp  for Dissemination, replicates the successful
              Kieve Science Camp for Girls and cultivates a  "ripple effect" in six
              participating school districts.  Designed to tackle issues known to stifle the 
              confidence and enthusiasm of girls in science, the project is a based on
              research and expertise  of the Kieve Science Camp instructors and staff.  It is
              a one year effort to train and support 24  adult dissemination leaders (12
              parents and teachers and 12 leaders from other science camps  in Maine).  They
              will be trained through observation and participation with campers in the Kieve
               Science Camp for Girls and through a series of four seminars accompanying the
              camp  experience.  The seminars are designed to help teachers and parents
              return to their communities  prepared to be advocates for gender equity and
              experiential education in science.    This project uses a collaborative
              learning environment to provide professional development for  teachers, to
              teach the Kieve Science Camp for Girls model to other camp staff, and to
              cultivate  local actions on behalf of girls in Maine Schools.  The Kieve
              Science Camp for girls is a  residential experience for 120 fourth, fifth, and
              sixth graders from six rural and resource-poor  communities in Maine focusing
              on experiential educations.  in addition challenges requiring  cooperation and
              risk-taking are encouraged.  The goal of the camp is to effect a positive 
              attitudinal shift, helping girls see that science is fun, and developing their
              confidence to  participate fully in the world of science and technology.  The
              carefully-selected female  instructors and staff support the importance of the
              role models.  ***
