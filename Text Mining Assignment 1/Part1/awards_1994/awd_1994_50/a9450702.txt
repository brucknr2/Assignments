Abstract    :
              9450702  Fine              A master plan will be developed for making sweeping
              changes in what  we teach in chemistry and how we teach it, in light of 
              revolutionary ways for improved learning that will be widely  available before
              the end of this decade.  At the heart of the   systemic changes proposed is a
              broadening of the curriculum across  traditional academic and professional
              boundaries to better reflect  the needs of a productive lifetime in society for
              students of  different backgrounds, abilities and interests.  At the same time,
               by conceiving a new curriculum plan from the top down, it will be  possible to
              produce one that is inclusive, not exclusive, allowing  those who complete the
              major to share ideas and develop points of  view and attitudes that have a
              common origin with those students  who drop away earlier into alternate
              careers.  For those who do  drop away, the curriculum plan provides a realistic
              sense of what  is exciting and important in chemistry and how it fits into
              their  lives.  Proposed curriculum changes depend on delivery systems that 
              take advantage of the technological transformation that is  presently altering
              learning through electronic communication and  visualization of information. 
              This planning proposal will have a  significant impact in bringing about change
              in the entire chemistry  curriculum at Columbia and it will be transferable to
              chemistry  departments in other institutions.  Other institutions working on 
              this project are IIT, MIT, Stevens Institute, Northwestern,  Wisconsin, North
              Carolina.
