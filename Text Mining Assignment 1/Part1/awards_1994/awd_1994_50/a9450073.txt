Abstract    :
              9450073  Ellis  A new Gordon Research conference that is focused on innovations 
              in the teaching of college chemistry provides a unique  opportunity to
              familiarize an influential group of educators  with cutting-edge pedagogical
              and curricular developments.  By  providing a forum for acquainting these
              individuals with one  another and with the state of the art in course content
              and  instructional methods,  the conference can serve as a mechanism  for
              enhancing the quality of instruction for our nation's  undergraduate chemistry
              students.  Funds are requested to help  ensure broad representation of
              institutions of higher education  at the conference.  ***
