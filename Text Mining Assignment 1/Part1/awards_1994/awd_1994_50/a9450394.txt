Abstract    :
              9450394  The proposed research would attempt to gain a better  understanding of
              the environmental/geochemical processes involved  in the "trapping " of
              hydrophobic organic molecules within the  organic matrix of sediments. The
              experimental approach to solve  this problem is based on the development of an
              analytical  technique capable of recovering these non extractable components 
              from the sediment/soil sample.
