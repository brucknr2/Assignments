Abstract    :
              This project will focus on three complementary issues in the study  of galaxy
              formation in the universe through nonlinear gravitational  collapse.  First,
              the Lagrangian fluid method based on the velocity  gradient and gravity
              gradient tensors will be used to analytically  study the nonlinear evolution of
              density perturbations in several  models including the effects of shears and
              tides during the  collapse.  Second, N-body simulation codes will be used to
              test the  approximation schemes used in the analytical studies and to extend 
              the above analytical Langrangian fluid method to more realistic  systems. 
              Third, the theoretical understandings gained concerning  gravitational collapse
              including the effects of shears and tides  will be combined with current
              observational data to constrain or  exclude competing models of dark matter in
              the universe.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate special
              topics  course in astrophysics; guest lecturing on aspects of particle 
              astrophysics in introductory and advanced physics courses at the  undergraduate
              level; hosting regular lunches to promote informal  interaction and develop a
              sense of community among women faculty  and women physics major; and meeting
              informally with a campus group  interested in space exploration.
