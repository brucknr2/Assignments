Abstract    :
              This research involves the use of optical coherence techniques,  such as photon
              echo and hole-burning experiments, to study rare  earth doped glasses in which
              a refractive index change or second  harmonic generation has been optically
              induced.  These  photoinduced phenomena are being used in a number of fiber
              optic  devices, but a detailed understanding of the underlying  microscopic
              mechanism is lacking.  The objective is to gain  insight about the microscopic
              nature of these photoinduced  changes.  One part of the research focuses on the
              local structure  and dynamics of the rare earth ion whereas a second part deals
               with the dynamics of the host glass.  The results of these  experiments will
              provide insight into the microscopic changes  associated with photoinduced
              phenomena in glasses and may lead to  the development of more efficient
              materials and devices.    The interactive activities consist of teaching an
              advanced  undergraduate courses in Physical Chemistry, advising and  mentoring
              of undergraduate students, organizing a seminar series,  and organizing a
              seminar series for students and faculty in the  Chemistry department.
