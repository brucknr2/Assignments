Abstract    :
              9450249  Finkral    There is an increasing need for instructional materials
              which integrate mathematics, science and technology education.  This project
              produces several instructional packages for secondary school students which are
              consistent with the standards from each of the disciplines.  The units are
              published as supplements in journals, such as TIES Magazine, The Technology
              Teacher, The Mathematics Teacher and The Science Teacher, to reduce the lead
              time from development to use. They are developed in a collaborative effort
              among teachers, subject specialists, and practitioners from science and
              industry.  Local and national support is available to help teachers and groups
              of teachers use the materials.  The research and evaluation component measures
              the impact of the units and provides models for increased use. The products
              include the units, teacher guides for use of the materials and support via
              electronic means.  Themes to be engaged include science and technology of
              sports, biotechnology, music, fire prevention, control systems, etc.    ***
