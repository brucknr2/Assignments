Abstract    :
              This project has improved the psychobiology laboratory at the  institution, and
              is affecting upper division courses in both the  psychology and biology
              departments. Equipment includes an  18-channel computerized locomotor-activity
              monitor for rodents.  Monitoring of locomotor activity is an extremely
              convenient  procedure for the study of the temporal organization of behavior. 
              As part of ongoing courses, psychology students monitor locomotor  activity to
              learn about the sensory and neural mechanisms of  circadian rhythmicity.
              Biology students monitor activity to learn  about the endocrine control of
              estrous cyclicity. This new,  computerized equipment also allows all students
              more individualized  experience in the laboratory and provides a  continuous
              recording  of animal activity over time. Overall, the project will provide a 
              significant improvement in the training of students in  psychobiology and will
              serve as a model for other institutions  involved in undergraduate teaching of
              psychology and biology.
