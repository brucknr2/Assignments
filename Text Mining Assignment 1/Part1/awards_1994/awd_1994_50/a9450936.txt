Abstract    :
              9450936  Compaan                                                   The
              University of Toledo Department of Physics and Astronomy  proposes to enhance
              its advanced undergraduate Atomic and Molecular  Physics Laboratory (Physics
              481) with the addition of a structured  sequence of experiments in high
              resolution spectroscopy.  This  sequence will build on existing experiments,
              which use grating  spectrometers and Fabry-Perot interferometers, to add
              several  related experiments in high resolution atomic and molecular 
              spectroscopy. The new laboratory experiences will include 1) Raman  scattering
              from diatomic molecules, 2) velocity measurements on  solar spectra using the
              UT heliostat, an echelle spectrometer, and  a CCD detector, 3) Doppler-free
              tunable diode laser saturation  spectroscopy of rubidium vapor, 4) recoilless
              gamma ray absorption  studies via the Mossbauer effect, and 5) radiative
              lifetime  measurements with a pulsed diode laser. This sequence will provide 
              the students with laboratory experiences utilizing modern  spectroscopy
              equipment, data acquisition, and data analysis while  exposing them to classic
              experiments which all relate to linewidth  broadening in electromagnetic
              radiation processes. Among other  measurements the students will determine
              interatomic separations in  O2, N2, and CO2, the nuclear spin statistics and
              rotational  temperatures of these molecules, the rotational velocity of the 
              sun, Gaussian and Lorentzian broadening in gases, mode structures  of laser
              emission, recoil-free radiation processes with high energy  photons, and
              uncertainty principle limits to radiative linewidths.
