Abstract    :
              SSC-9450363  Northwestern Univ  Evanston, IL  Goodnight, Lynn    "National High
              School Institute Engineering, Science & Mathematics  Summer Program for Young
              Teens"    The National High School Institute of Northwestern University 
              appeals to the National Science Foundation for support of an  exciting new
              program.  The NHSI's Engineering and Science Program  for Young Teens, will
              make it possible for 50 adolesents each year  (total of 150) to participate in
              a five-week, academic program  aimed at nurturing their interests in
              engineering, science and  mathematics, free of charge.  This program will be
              piloted in the  summer of 1994; we seek NSF funding for 1995, 1996 and 1997.   
              This tuition-free program will be presented June 26-July 30 in 1994  and June
              25-July 29, 1995, with other dates TBA.  Children entering  7th, 8th and 9th
              grades will be selected through close  communication with the Chicago Public
              Schoolsand the Chicago Board  of Education, with the aim of identifying
              talented minority  children who are economically at-risk.  Special aspects of
              this  program include the large pool of needy Chicago children, the  strong
              asset of Northwestern's resources, and the 63-year  successful tradition of the
              national High School Institute.    The inter-disciplinary curriculum will
              include classroom time, lab  sessions and research projects, career exploration
              activities, and  field trips.  Examples of mini-courses for the first year
              include  "Forensic Science: Chemistry and Crime Solving," "Astronomy and  Space
              Science," and "Computer Programming in C."    The Faculty will be drawn from
              Northwestern University's acclaimed  McCormick School of Engineering and
              Applied Science and the College  of Arts and Sciences, assisted by eight
              graduate students.  The  program will be located at Northwestern University's
              Chicago and  Evanston campuses, with buses picking up the participants from 
              neghborhood locations.  Designed to encourage and support these  young teens,
              the program provides opportunities for f ocused  learning, peer and family
              involvement, and career counselling.  ***
