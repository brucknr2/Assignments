Abstract    :
              9450558  Walker    The Marine and Aquatic Mini-Camp For Female Secondary
              Students is  a series of several-day, field-based, inquiry-focused, hands-on 
              educational experiences designed to modify an existing,  successful program at
              the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory to meet  the specific needs of a population
              of secondary,  at-risk-for-science female students.  The Principal
              Investigators  believe that the proposed effort will contribute to a realistic 
              change in the academic and professional ambitions of participating  students,
              thus enhancing their scientific literacy and career  aspirations. A more
              specific goal is for the participants to  continue their formal science
              education through  enrollment or re-enrollment in high school science courses. 
                  The residential programs will be composed of four major conceptual 
              sections:  oceanography and hydrologic processes; marine and  aquatic
              biology-fauna; marine and aquatic biology-flora;  and, beach and barrier
              islands.  The effort will build upon an  established relationship with local
              schools to ensure selection of  students who could most benefit, as well who
              could be tracked  over time.  Selected students from the same school would
              attend at  the same time.  Schools are in northwest Florida, Alabama, 
              Mississippi, and Louisiana.  ***
