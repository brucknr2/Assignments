Abstract    :
              The project will purchase a site license for the SPARTAN  computational
              chemistry and molecular modeling package for use in  general and organic
              chemistry.  The programs will run on the PC  network and will serve four
              campuses of the college.  The SPARTAN  software will be used as an aid in the
              study of bonding and  structure.  The graphics workstation will be used to
              further  develop SPARTAN applications. The graphics and video production 
              features of the workstation, in conjunction with the EXPLORER  visualization
              package included, will allow the to produce images  and video tapes useful as
              classroom aids to understanding chemical  bonding and structure.
