Abstract    :
              9450881  Mogawer                                                   The
              Deparments of Civil Engineering and Materials Engineering will  enhance the
              Materials Testing Laboratory with the addition of a  modern computerized
              universal testing machine. The new machine will  enable innovative development
              of new challenging laboratory  experiments, which are impossible to carry out
              previously. These  include uniaxial fatigue and creep testing, as well as 
              determination of the mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures  (resilience
              modulus) and other construction materials under complex  states of stress.  The
              project staff has committed to active  participation in outreach efforts to
              local high schools which have  large populations of underrepresented minority
              students.   Dissemination will occur via updating of a nationally distributed 
              laboratory manual.
