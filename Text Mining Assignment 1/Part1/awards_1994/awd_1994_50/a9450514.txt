Abstract    :
              9450514  Sylvia Ware    Travel to the 13th International Conference on Chemical
              Education    This project supports the participation of fifty chemical
              educators  at the 13th IUPAC International Conference on Chemical Education to 
              be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico, August 8-12, 1994.  Half of the  educators
              are elementary, middle school and secondary school  science teachers and half
              are college faculty.  The purposes of the  project are three-fold: i) to use
              the international experience to  enhance the leadership of the teachers within
              their own local,  regional and national networks; ii) to introduce teachers to
              issues  of chemistry and science education in other countries expanding  their
              knowledge and classroom implementation options; and, iii) to  sensitize
              teachers to ways of teaching chemistry to different  cultural groups,
              especially those of Hispanic and African ancestry.   Participants attend two
              orientation workshops, one prior to and one  during the conference, to enhance
              their participation in the formal  program and to plan networking activities
              upon their return to the  United States.  Teachers also visit schools in Puerto
              Rico.   Networking activities include participation in an ACS-supported 
              symposium on the San Juan Conference at the 1995 ChemED Conference;  regional
              workshops and lectures; and articles in journals,  newsletters, and teacher
              magazines.
