Abstract    :
              9450953  Lovelock                                                  The
              University of Arizona is creating a Special Purpose Computer  Aided Classroom
              devoted exclusively to students taking Ordinary  Differential Equation and
              Linear Algebra sequences for sophomores,  juniors, and seniors. The emphasis in
              these courses is now less on  methods and more on thinking, understanding, and
              experimenting.  This Special Purpose Classroom contains 32 DOS machines with
              the  IBM Personal Science Laboratory (PSL) available on 8 machines. The  PSL is
              being used to gather and display experimental data in real  time. During class
              time, the computers is being used to enhance  thinking, understanding, and
              problem solving, and encourage  supervised experimentation. The design of this
              classroom is  particularly conducive to interactive classes, cooperative 
              learning, and working in groups. This project impact about 1250  students per
              year. Typically, they are prospective scientists,  engineers, teachers of high
              school mathematics, and mathematicians.  One particular benefit is that future
              teachers are being taught in  ways that it is hoped they will later teach.
