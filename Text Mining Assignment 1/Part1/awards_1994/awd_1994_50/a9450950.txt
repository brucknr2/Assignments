Abstract    :
              9450950  Tseng                                                               An
              interdisciplinary project involving the Departments of Biology,  Mathematics,
              Computer Science, and Statistics on incorporates  computer imaging technology
              into the biology curriculum. A  multi-functional computer image analysis system
              with the custom  designed software has been developed for such a purpose. This 
              master system combines three major functions (electrophoresis gel  analysis,
              chromosome analysis/karyotyping, and morphometric  analysis) into a single
              unit, a workstation.   Twenty of these workstations are used for 1) teaching of
              a new  course in Bioimaging, and 2) incorporation of the imaging  technology
              into four biology courses (Microbiology, Cell Biology,  Genetics, and
              Recombinant DNA) and one Computer Graphics course.  The Bioimaging lab is also
              used for honors projects involving image  analysis.
