Abstract    :
              Abstract 566  Busch  Unleashing the Power of Molecular Design and Synthesis for
              Science  and Technology    The objectives of the proposed program are:      (1)
              to create and establish the Kansas Advanced Synthesis  Laboratory (KASL) for
              the following purposes:  (a) to educate  undergraduate and graduate student by
              providing the only laboratory  courses in the State on advanced chemical
              synthesis, (b) to provide  a special facility that will maintain special
              equipment and  facilitate research in synthetic chemistry, (c) to develop a 
              facility for custom synthesis (at low cost) of unavailable  substances needed
              by other scientists in the State of Kansas, (d)  to augment human resources by
              adding an outstanding synthetic  chemist to the faculty in Kansas who will
              serve as the Director of  KASL, a technician who will assist the Director, KASL
              Scholars, and  KASL Summer Faculty Students, (e) to increase the productivity
              of  synthetic chemists who have not recently been active in research by 
              involving them in the educational and research components of KASL;     (2) to
              complete the statewide computer network being established  under EPSCoR for
              doing molecular science over and electronic  highway, for the following
              purposes:  (a) to provide a powerful  molecular modeling capability on the
              desktop of involved molecular  scientists throughout the state, (b) to
              facilitate collaborations  through the realtime exchange of scientific
              information, including  collaborative thinking, by molecular scientists, (c) to
              assist  statewide in chemistry education by the sharing of chemistry  software
              and presentations over the State of Kansas education  network, (d) to provide
              access by molecular scientists to databases  and software particularly germane
              to their science; and                     (3) to contribute to professional
              development by sponsoring an  international conference on an important subject
              in the developing  of new substances, the XIX International Symposium on
              Macrocyclic  Chemistry.
