              Monroe  PROJECT SUMMARY     The project will improve learning opportunities for
              students at two year colleges--those that transfer, those that will become
              technicians in the high-technology workplace, and all students for whom physics
              serves as a part of their college education.  It will do this by establishing a
              network of physics faculty in two-year colleges.  The network will consist of
              15 regional organizations, coordinated and linked by a national steering
              committee.  The development of the network of colleagues will allow two-year
              college faculty to share their successes as teachers and scholars with each
              other and with the broader physics community, it will increase their awareness
              of current developments in physics education research and innovative teaching
              strategies, and it will decrease the sense of isolation felt by many two-year
              college faculty members.  During the four year project, fifteen Regional
              Coordinators and their Regional Teams, selected and mentored by a Steering
              Committee, will organize and host small local meetings and will lead
              participants as they develop project s and programs within their regions
              relating to critical and topical issues that may be particularly important in
              the region.  Many of these issues will be developed from the work begun at the
              1989 topical conference entitled  Critical Issues in Two-Year College Physics
              and Astronomy - 1990 and Beyond  supported by the American Association of
              Physics Teachers (AAPT) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) and at the
              1992 NSF Workshop on the Role of Professional Societies in Science, Technology,
              Engineering, and Mathematics Education in Two-Year Colleges.  To enlarge the
              network and provide a national forum, the Regional Coordinators and three
              elected delegates from each region will participate in a national meeting,
              convened as an AAPT Topical Conference, where various speakers and consultants
              will engage participants in a more global discussion of critical issues and
              issues of particular and timely pedagogical significance.  These conferences
              will make recommendations for national reform.  By the conclusion of the
              project, the Steering Committee will have produced three proceedings from the
              annual meetings, will have compiled and published demographic data better
              describing the two-year college physics education communities, and will have
              written a major report characterizing the two-year college faculty and its
              impact on the physics education community of our country.  In addition, fifteen
              regional structures will have been established, under the auspices of AAPT,
              which will allow for the continued collaboration on issues of importance to the
              physics education communities.
