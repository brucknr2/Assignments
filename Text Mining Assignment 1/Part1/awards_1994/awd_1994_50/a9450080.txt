Abstract    :
              This research concerns the investigation of linear codes associated  with
              designs, and continues work that Dr. Jennifer Key has been  engaged in over the
              last few years which includes a graduate-level  book, written jointly with E.
              F. Assmus, Jr.  Coding-theoretical  properties of the design that can lead to a
              characterization of  design within the set of designs with the same parameters.
                Conversely, geometrical properties of the design can lead to  immediate
              insights into the code which can help in the  determination of the usefulness
              of the code in practical  applications.    Interactive activities include
              teaching a course either to advanced  undergraduates in the area of coding
              theory, geometry or group  theory, or a course to graduates on algebraic coding
              theory, or in  design theory; and arranging an advanced seminar series which
              would  include four or five notable visitors, each visiting for at least  a
              week.  Other activities include substantial involvement in the  faculty and
              with the students, and informal discussion meetings.
