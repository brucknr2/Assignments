Abstract    :
              9450474  The proposed research would continue the development of research 
              emphasis in fisheries oceanography. The scientific focus of the  proposed work
              is the fine scale vertical and temporal  distribution of copepod life stages in
              patches of cod and haddock  larvae sampled intensively during Georges Bank
              "process" cruises.  Approximately 40 fine mesh (.064mm) one fourth m MOCNESS
              samples  selected from four spring cruises conducted in 1981-1983 on the 
              southern part of the Georges Bank will be processed.
