Abstract    :
              SSC-9450484  Bentley College  Waltham, MA  Wallace, Robert and Richard Frese   
              "Science Horizons:  The Bentley College Science-Math Summer Camp"    Bentley
              proposes a four-week Monday-Friday residential summer  program with academic
              year follow-up, for girls from under-  represented minority groups, entering
              the 7th, 8th and 9th grades.   The program will run for three years beginning
              July 5-29, 1994.   Approximately 10 will be selected  from each of fine schools
              (3 in  Boston, 2 in Cambridge).  Schools will be selected such that the 50 
              girls will represent a number minority groups (will be African-  American,
              Latina, Haitian, and Southeast-Asian in origin) and a  variety of abilities
              (will attend non-magnet and magnet schools,  etc.)  The major criterion for
              selection will be on motivation and  interest in science/math and a clear
              understanding of the nature of  the program.  Emphasis will be placed
              throughout the program on  factors affecting interest and success in
              science/math of the  students not only as under represented minorities, but
              also as  females.  A core component of the curriculum will be based upon a 
              three-week pilot offered at Bentley in the summer of 1993 for 15  predominantly
              minority girls.  This program utilized a curriculum,  in which age-appropriate
              mathematics were integrated with chemistry  laboratory experiments utilizing
              (1) team work and cooperative  learning styles and (2) material and problems
              familiar to girls in  particular.
