Abstract    :
              9450849  Gale                                 \A powerful microcomputer-based
              computer algebra system such as  Maple V is a resource for calculus teaching
              that can enhance  students' understanding of fundamental concepts, enable
              students  and instructors to do realistic applications, and ameliorate the 
              ongoing decline in the number of students pursuing technical  degrees. To
              maximize these benefits the CAS must be incorporated  smoothly into each class
              session in such a way that students can  see how the program is used, and can
              use it themselves whenever  need or opportunity arises. To this end, the
              Department of  Mathematics of the University of North Carolina at Asheville is 
              teaching calculus in a combination classroom/computer laboratory.   A classroom
              is outfitted with 19 Macintosh Centris 650 computers,  an In Focus System 6000
              LCD projection panel, and some networking  hardware and software.  The calculus
              computer classroom (not a  laboratory) enables smooth transitions between
              lecture/discussion  and computer explorations. This classroom enables the
              mathematics  faculty to teach calculus courses in an innovative way and creates
               a model for math departments initiating changes in their own  curricula.
