Abstract    :
              9450385  The proposed research would study the contributions of  multiplicative,
              epistatic, dominant and additive interactions of  alleles at different loci to
              heterosis using reproductive traits  and the domestic chicken, Gallus
              Domesticus, as model phenotypes  and organisms respectively. The project will
              also involve the use  of molecular genotype similarity to assess the effect of
              genetic  distance on the level of heterosis.
