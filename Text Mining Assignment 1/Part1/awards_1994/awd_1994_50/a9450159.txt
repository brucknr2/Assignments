Abstract    :
              9450159   Jennings                                 A short course in Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry and Mass  Spectrometry will be offered to 20
              undergraduate faculty.   Participants will be chosen from institutions which
              have recently  purchased, or are in the process of purchasing, this 
              instrumentation.  These techniques are the most widely used methods  for
              determining molecular structure in the modern laboratory. Often  the faculty
              have inadequate experience with the techniques and are  unable to take full
              advantage of the instruments in their  curriculum.  This course is designed to
              provide the participants  with indepth knowledge of the fundamentals and
              applications of this  instrumentation.  The participants will be encouraged to
              utilize  their experience through the development of curricular modules.   The
              curricular modules may be used to enhance undergraduate  education at their
              home institutions in these two important  chemical instrumentation techniques.
