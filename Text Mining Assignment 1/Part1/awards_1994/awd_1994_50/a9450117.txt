Abstract    :
              Behavioral plasticity in social organization has been linked to the  evolution
              of the strikingly different levels of sociality exhibited  among the
              Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps).  This research will  study this idea with
              comparative behavior and phylogeny of the  bumble bee subgenus Fervidobombus. 
              Species of Fervidobombus, by  virtue of their inter- and intraspecific
              phenotypic diversity in  social organization among widespread geographic
              populations, are  ideal for testing hypotheses concerning the role of
              behavioral  plasticity in social organization.  The evolution of diversity in 
              social traits within Fervidobombus can best be understood through  explicit
              reference to phylogeny.  If, for example, colony size and  social organization
              are local adaptations (reflecting behavioral  plasticity) to geographically
              varying environments, then it would  be expected that the social traits and
              environmental variables  would cluster together on the same branches of a
              phylogenetic  tree.  This hypothesis will be tested optimizing behavioral
              traits  onto a phylogentic tree and testing for association.  The proposed 
              research will lead to new comparative data on Fervidobombus social 
              organization and to the completion of a species phylogeny based on  nucleotide
              sequences from the mitochondrial genome.      Interactive activities include: 
              (1) developing a modern graduate  level systematics course; (2) developing a
              systematics laboratory  for use as an interactive facility; and (3) developing
              a computer  facility for use as a teaching and training tool.  Additional 
              interactions with students and faculty include an early career 
              female-scientists seminar series and museum lunch.
