Abstract    :
              9450209  Hiatt  The  Academy of Arts and Sciences, under the direction of 
              Howard  Hiatt, M.D., as the Principal Investigator, will conduct a series  of 
              conferences intended to enable participants and  the  broader  community, 
              especially  those  involved  in  the  Urban  Systemic  Initiatives  (USI), to
              understand and address the problems  faced  by children living in poverty and
              the impact of these problems on  urban  learning  communities.   Two  of  the 
              conferences,   "The  Economics  of  Child  Poverty,"  (conducted  jointly  
              with   the  Children's  Defense  League)  and "Economic,  Health  and  Family 
              Status  Indicators"  will  be  funded  by  the  National  Science  Foundation. 
               The conferences will bring together social  science  researchers, community
              and government agencies, members of funded  USI cities and other interested
              parties.  They will probe beneath  factual  associations  to understand the 
              primary  and  secondary  causal  mechanisms for children's learning and  living
               problems.  Their objectives include:  *  reviewing existing knowledge.  * 
              focusing public attention on conditions affecting the teaching  and learning of
              mathematics and science.  *   suggesting  educational programs that will lead 
              to  systemic  reform.  *  promulgating conference results.  *  identifying
              topics for further research.
