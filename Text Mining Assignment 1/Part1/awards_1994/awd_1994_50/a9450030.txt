Abstract    :
              9450030  Whitney    This project, Advocates for Women in Science, Engineering,
              and Mathematics (AWSEM), is  designed to create and support a regional network
              of science and technology practitioners,  educator, parents, and community
              organizations committed to the enrichment of opportunities  in science,
              engineering, and mathematics for young women.  The project's structure will
              support  the development of materials and resources to deliver activities and
              career information on science  and technology to intermediate and high school
              girls, and will lay the foundation for long-term  continuation of these
              efforts.  Strategies for implementation include the expansion and  maintenance
              of a comprehensive database of science practitioners, students, parents, and 
              educators.  The Project will act as a central reference center offering
              resources to assist local  communities in encouraging young women to study
              science and mathematics.  A cadre of  advocates will disseminate career
              information, organize hands-on experiences, promote  mentorships, facilitate
              tutoring, and showcase practitioners in science and technical fields.  ***
