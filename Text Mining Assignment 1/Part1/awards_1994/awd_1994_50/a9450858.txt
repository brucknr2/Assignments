Abstract    :
              Geologists are using personal computers in all phases of work in  both academic
              and industrial applications. It is imperative that  undergraduate students be
              exposed to many computer-oriented  applications in order to have a smooth
              transition to graduate  school or the work place in a more professional,
              efficient, and  less stressful manner. The use of portable computer equipment
              in  geology field camp, a required undergraduate course in an unique 
              environment (full time work with real problems), is an ideal  educational
              opportunity. The following applications are being  initiated: stratigraphic
              analysis, structural analysis using stereo  nets, computer-generated contour
              maps (use and pitfalls),  geological map and cross section preparation, and
              graphical  illustrations and geological report writing. In addition, the 
              portable nature of the hardware allows use of this equipment in  mineralogy,
              petrology, economic, structure, hydrology, and  geophysics labs during the rest
              of the year. This allows students  to solve geological problems without leaving
              the lab and the  instructor in order to go to computer cluster locations.
              Overall,  the enhancement not only allows for quicker and more professional 
              products, but most importantly, old exercises are updated to a new  level of
              modern geology and geological analysis.
