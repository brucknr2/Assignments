Abstract    :
              9450513  Ferguson    This project seeks funds to support a science education
              forum  entitled "Scientists, Educators, and National Standards: Action at  the
              Local Level."  The form is to address the understanding of  national standards
              and the issue of how scientists from  universities, government and other
              agencies can contribute to the  success of the standards and the proposed
              science reform.  Efforts  are to be made to determine how scientists and
              engineers might best  help to improve science education in their local schools.
               The  building of partnerships between scientists, engineers and K-12  teachers
              will be a major thrust of this forum.
