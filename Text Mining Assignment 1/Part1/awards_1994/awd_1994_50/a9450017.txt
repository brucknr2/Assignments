Abstract    :
              9450017  Maki    Proposed project builds upon an already successful program
              which  provides enriching experiences for junior high girls.  The overall 
              objective appears to be retention of girls who have expressed and  interest in
              and demonstrated some ability in SEM careers by  providing on-going contact,
              increased exposure to hands-on activity  and professional role models.  In
              addition, the project proposes to  expand the pool of individuals who can
              encourage the interests  these girls express in SEM careers on an on-going
              basis by  conducting workshops for significant adults in the lives of these 
              girls (parents, organization leaders, teachers) to SEM careers and  engaging
              them in hands-on science and math projects and  demonstrations which show these
              subjects as fun and easily  replicable in other situations.    The overall
              project approach and the evaluation plan have merit and  will make specific
              attempts to encourage the participation of  Native American female
              participants.  As participation of members  of this target group have been
              minimal in previous projects, it is  recommended the PI's contact the American
              Indian Science &  engineering Society Headquarters (located in Boulder, CO) and
              get  recommendations on the best approach for including Native American  girls
              in this project and a letter of endorsement which can be  taken to the
              reservation during the recruitment effort  ***
