Abstract    :
              9450848  Evans                                The Department of Mathematics at
              Oklahoma State University operates  a modern, comprehensive mathematics
              laboratory called the  Mathematics Learning Resource Center (MLRC).  The
              functions of the  MLRC are being expanded to serve as a Model Laboratory and
              Regional  Technology Assistance Center. The Center serves colleges and 
              universities in a five state region providing information, software 
              instruction, curricular materials, and public domain software  through an
              active outreach program that includes hands-on  workshops, local and remote
              site visits, special sessions at  regional meetings, and a computer bulletin
              board. The bulletin  board is accessible through either electronic mail or
              anonymous  file transfer protocol (ftp) on the internet. Telephone, fax, or 
              mail is available for those who do not have access to the internet.  An
              important function of the Center is to disseminate recent  reforms in the
              mathematics curriculum and to assist clients in  familiarizing themselves with
              whatever technology may be necessary  to implement the reforms.  NSF-funded
              projects and curriculum  reforms related to technology are featured.  The
              Center also  provides advice on obtaining funding for acquisition of equipment 
              and software.  Long term plans are to foster a network of such  regional
              centers around the country.
