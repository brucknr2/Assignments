Abstract    :
              9450503  Brett    The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network's Science 
              Student Internship Program (SSIP) project will enable five  minority
              mathematics, science, or engineering (MSE) majors to  participate in a ten-week
              summer internship at NSF and in an  academic year outreach project based at
              each student's home  institution.  The students will be exposed to
              decision-making and  policy formulation in science and engineering fields;
              provide  agencies with high ability students who can make contributions to 
              existing programs; prepare students for future MSE leadership  positions;
              enhancing the students' awareness of MSE educational  policy issues impacting
              minorities; and reinforcing the  importance of community service.  NSF staff
              will gain valuable  insights from the student interns into the obstacles
              preventing  minority students from pursuing MSE careers and possible 
              strategies for significantly increasing the participation of  minority students
              in MSE fields.
