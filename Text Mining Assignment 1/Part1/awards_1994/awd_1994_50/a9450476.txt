Abstract    :
              9450476  The proposed research involves several projects with a common  theme
              focusing on cellular and molecular mechanisms of signal  transduction using a
              variety of cell types as experimental model  systems. The first project will
              test the hypothesis that  physiologically relevant alterations occur in the
              cellular levels  of G-proteins or their subunits. The second project will 
              investigate the physiological functions of peripheral  benzodiazepine receptors
              in alveolar type two neumocytes. The  third project will study the regulation
              and secretion of  secretion and cell surface expression of galactoside binding 
              proteins by cytosolic calcium fluxes.
