Abstract    :
              9450522  Greeno    This project studies ways in which research can play a more 
              productive role in educational reform, particularly in mathematics  at the
              Middle School Mathematics Project (MMAP) with interviews and  other
              communication with researchers and developers who are engaged  in efforts
              toward educational reform in mathematics.  The study is  based on the
              assumption that practice can be guided by knowledge of  examples that is
              communicated as generalizable models.  Generality  is facilitated by analyses
              that identify the factors that are  needed for models to succeed and that
              assist in applying models to  local circumstances.
