Abstract    :
              9450597  George    Based upon the premise that what happens outside the school
              setting is critical to fostering girls'  interst in math and science, AAAS will
              adapt the successful "Girls and Science:  Linkages for  the Future"
              pass-through training model in order to deliver hands-on extracurricular
              science  activities to girls, ages 5-17, from underrepresented minority
              Hispanic-American and African-  American populations through a network of
              community-based organizations (CBOs).  It is felt  that this populatio is
              doubly at risk for falling out of the pipeline leading to careers in science, 
              engineering, and mathematics.  In this training model, which has been used for
              years by some  CBOs such as the Girl Scouts, AAAS staff will train local
              trainers who, in turn, will train  leaders in their organization to deliver the
              science activities to the girls.  AAAS will utilize  CBOs that already use the
              pass-through model to help establish the training model where it does  not now
              exist.      The effectiveness of the program will be enhanced by including
              minority female college students  enrolled in science programs as assistants,
              mentors, and role models.  A second enhancement  will be the parent workshops
              designed to encourage parents to raise the expectations they hold  for their
              daughters' educational activities.  The effectiveness of these enhancements has
              been  proven in other AAAS equity projects.  Materials and publications
              developed by AAAS for  similar projects will be adapted where necessary to
              better meet the needs of the targeted  populations.  Some new products also
              will be developed.  ***
