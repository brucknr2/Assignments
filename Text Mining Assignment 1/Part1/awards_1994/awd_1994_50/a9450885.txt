Abstract    :
              9450885  Al-Saigh  Funds are requested for purchasing a state-of-the-art Atomic 
              Absorption Spectrometer to be used for undergraduate instruction  in chemistry
              at Columbus College.  Several courses will be  affected by the proposed
              equipment.  This instrument is intended  to enhance the quality of instruction
              and to expose students to  both the theoretical background and the
              (experimental) operation  of modern computer-assisted equipment.  The AA will
              be  incorporated in the curriculum of General Chemistry, Instrumental 
              Analysis, Quantitative Analysis, Physical Chemistry,  Biochemistry, Inorganic
              Chemistry, and in undergraduate research  in Chemistry.  Students will be able
              to use a powerful analytical  technique to quantify a variety of elements such
              as lead in water  and waste water, calcium in solutions, zinc in hair,
              manganese  and iron in pet food, manganese in steel, and lead in food,  blood,
              serum,  and soft drinks.  In addition, students will  determine toxic metals
              such as Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, Se, and Ag in  water and wastes.  Students will
              appreciate the utilization and  benefits of interfacing a computer with this
              instrument and the  effect it has on quantification.
