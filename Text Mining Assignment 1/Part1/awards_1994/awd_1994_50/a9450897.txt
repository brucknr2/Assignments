Abstract    :
              9450897  Kagan                                                    The University
              of New Haven Physics Department will equip an  innovative instructional
              facility for science education. This  facility will be used as an undergraduate
              teaching facility for  physics. However, the facility will be multi-functional,
              and will  be used for a number of University educational initiatives in other 
              science and mathematics courses as well. Traditional undergraduate  students,
              secondary minority students in community outreach science  and mathematics
              enrichment programs, as well as science and  mathematics teachers in training,
              will be able to use this  facility. Although individual modules are
              computer-based, the  physics curriculum that will be implemented will integrate
              a  hands-on approach to scientific experimentation, and a  computer-interface
              (based on IBM's Personal Science Laboratory  (PSL) system) for data collection
              and analysis. The CUPLE  (Comprehensive Unified Physics Learning Environment)
              system, a new  approach to physics education, will also be integrated into this
               new program.
