Abstract    :

              Leudeman, John; and Klatt,  Elaine    The SEEKERS project will substantially
              increase the participation  of minorities in science, engineering, and
              mathematics (SEM)  careers by increasing the number of minority students
              entering  college preparation curricula and enrollment in high-level 
              mathematics and science courses. Targeted are 7th and 8th grade  children from
              10 counties in South Carolina who will enroll in a  four-week residential
              summer science camp followed by intensive  academic year reinforcement
              activities.  The first week of camp  will be held at Long Leadership 4-H
              Center; the second and third  at Cooper Leadership 4-H Center; and the final
              week on the campus  of Clemson University. Students will be involved in camp 
              activities 10 hours each day for 20 days.  The disciplinary focus  of SEEKERS
              is mathematics as applied to a variety of sciences and  technical areas with
              curricula tailored to South Carolina  students.  Follow-up activities will be
              SEEKERS clubs; initiated  during summer camps and implemented in the home
              communities of  all camp participants.  SEEKERS will impact 300 children and 
              their families each of the three years of funding.
