Abstract    :
              9450767  Small                                                                  
                The CUPM Recommendations for a General Mathematical Sciences  Program
              detailed a new view of undergraduate mathematics, stating  a philosophy
              centering on goals for student learning and outlining  a needed broadening of
              the curriculum. Subsequent CUPM documents  call for a 4-semester sequence of
              study that contains the core of  mathematics normally found in three semesters
              of calculus and  semesters of discrete mathematics, linear algebra,
              differential  equations, and probability and statistics. This call for a
              broader  view of mathematics dovetails well with the vision for secondary 
              school mathematics outlined in the NCTM's Curriculum and Evaluation  Standards.
               A workshop during summer, 1994, brings together leaders  from secondary,
              community college, liberal arts and research  university mathematics to discuss
              such 7-into-4 programs and to  review their implications for the variety of
              individuals and client  disciplines they serve. The United States Military
              Academy at West  Point has a fully implemented model of a 7-into-4 curriculum.
              The  activities of the workshop focus on discussing the content that  should be
              central to each of the seven curricular areas, examining  the Academy's
              program, and considering how content can be better  integrated to better
              prepare the students served. The products of  the conference consist of
              proceedings with commissioned papers and  reactions, details on the West Point
              program, and actions and  recommendations of the workshop. Panel discussions
              based on the  workshop will be proposed for future MAA meetings.  ***
