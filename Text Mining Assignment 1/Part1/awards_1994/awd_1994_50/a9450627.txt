Abstract    :
              9450627  Gosser                                                     City College
              requests support for a planning process leading to the  redesign and
              modernization of the undergraduate chemistry  curriculum at City College and
              partner community colleges.  The  planning will focus on extension of a new
              teaching model, Workshop  Chemistry, piloted at the College with NSF support. 
              The model  emphasizes collaborative learning and creates more active roles for 
              students in the teaching and learning processes, moving away from  the passive
              learning of the lecture mode.  The preliminary design  of course modules that
              will form the basis of the Workshop  Chemistry curriculum is a key aspect of
              the planning process.  The  modules can include any combination of laboratory,
              computer and  problem solving work.  The project directors will work with
              faculty  collaborators from the senior and community college levels to 
              translate their ideas into module outlines.  The outcome of the  planning phase
              will be a detailed plan for specification of the  course modules and how they
              will be integrated into the curriculum.  The planning process as well as the
              final project will involve as  partners faculty in other science disciplines,
              engineering, health   sciences, architecture and education, as well as
              individuals from  industry; this will facilitate the design of a curriculum
              which  promotes students' ability to apply chemistry concepts to other  fields.
