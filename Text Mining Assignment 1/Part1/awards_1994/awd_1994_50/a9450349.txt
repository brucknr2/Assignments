Abstract    :
              SSC-9450349  SUNY Research Foundation  Albany, NY  White, Denise    "NSF Native
              Science Foundations Summer Science Camp"    The NSF Native Science Foundations
              Summer Science Camp will give  ownership of science and mathematics to Native
              American students  through summer exploration of environmental elements and
              Native  views of the environment.  Students from the St. Regis Mohawk 
              Reservation at Akwesasne will take courses in Science, Mathematics, 
              Environmental Studies, and Writing Across the Curriculum.  Classes,  field
              studies, and visits by Native American scientists and  educators and other
              consultants will emphasize hands-on experiences  with practical applications of
              scientific and mathematical  concepts.  The program has been designed in
              conjunction with Mohawk  educators, parents, and students.  Potsdam College is
              the host  institution of the Northern Consortium of the State university of 
              New York (SUNY) Native American Initiative.  The summer residential  camp will
              be directed through the office of Native American  Affairs, within the
              College's office of Diversity.  The Native  Science Foundations Summer Science
              Camp will take Mohawk 7th, 8th,  and 9th grade students to the college's
              Adirondack mountain campus  at Star Lake for a four week exploration of Plants,
              Water, Earth,  and Air.  ***
