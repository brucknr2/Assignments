Abstract    :
              This research is aimed at analyzing and developing iterative  methods for
              solving the nonsymmetric linear systems that arise in  many areas of scientific
              computing.  Current iterative methods for  solving such problems ar sometimes
              effective but lack a firm  theoretical foundation and may not be robust. 
              Krylov space  methods, such as GMRES, will be analyzed and the idea of choosing
               approximations from different spaces will also be considered.  The 
              biconjugate gradient and QMR algorithms will be related and an  attempt made to
              explain their success.  Potential for parallelism  in various algorithms will
              be studied and parallel implementations  will be developed for specific machine
              architectures.   Collaborations are planned with Nick Trefethen and others in
              the  Computer Science Department at Cornell.    Two main activities for
              interacting with students are:  teaching a  graduate seminar ("CS 722") on
              iterative methods and matrix  analysis, to familiarize students and other
              interested scientists  and the state of the art in this field; and introducing
              a sophomore  level practicum where, in conjunction with the numerical analysis 
              course CS 222, students will implement parallel numerical  algorithms on the
              machines available at the Cornell Theory Center.   Various undergraduate
              seminars will be organized related to this  activity.
