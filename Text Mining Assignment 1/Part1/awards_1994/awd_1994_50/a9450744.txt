Abstract    :
              9450744  Ward                                                                   
               Faculty in the Department of Mathematics at Indian River Community  College
              are developing instructional materials for the use of the  graphing calculator
              to support teaching with the Harvard Calculus  Consortium materials that are
              appropriate for a two year college  audience.  Materials are being developed
              for both teachers and  students.  The teacher supplement contains examples and 
              instructions on how and when to effectively use a graphing  calculator as an
              instructional tool.  Less emphasis is placed on  traditional lecture and more
              emphasis is placed on exploration and  group problem solving.  The material
              integrates practical  applications taken from astronomy and physics and other
              areas that  use mathematics.  Students generate real data through the use of a 
              Calculator Base Laboratory System (CBL).  The device enables the  collection of
              real time data for analysis with the graphing  calculator.  The collection and
              analysis of real data provides the  means to integrate practical laboratory
              experience into pre-  calculus and calculus.  The instructional materials
              include the use  of the CBL system.    The student supplement is designed with
              an emphasis on using  technology to explore mathematical concepts and write
              about the  findings.  Projects address four types of activities: (1) "get 
              started" activities to familiarize students with using the  calculators; (2)
              activities to help students understand concepts;  (3) projects to promote
              deeper understanding of concepts that may  be used as group projects or for
              advanced students; and, (4)  investigation projects for topics beyond what is
              discussed in  class.  This range of activities will benefit the slower student
              by  providing activities for understanding as well as the advanced  student by
              providing enrichment material.  The conceptual approach  combined with real
              applications, emphasis on understanding and  problem solving benefits all
              students.
