Abstract    :
                Many large granitic bodies (plutons) are thought to originate as  partial
              melts at mid-crustal levels.  However, there is as yet no  clear understanding
              of the process of forming a large amount of  melt under such conditions nor of
              the source and transport of the  necessary H2O.  This detailed study of two
              small but well-exposed  areas in the Swiss Alps could reveal an incipient state
              of pluton  formation.  The proposed research will explore the feasibility of 
              generating a granitic pluton from such an area by using several  analytical
              techniques to characterize the rocks in major and  trace element composition,
              estimates of P-T conditions, stable  and radiogenic isotopes, and fluid
              inclusions.  The results will  also  contribute toward a better understanding
              of overall crustal  processes.    Interactive activities include; recruiting a
              female graduate  student to participate in the research; conducting a seminar
              at  graduate level and acting as a guest lecturer in undergraduate  classes
              with a special emphasis on promoting interest in natural  resources,
              environmental and social impacts of resources  exploitation, and conservation.
