              requirements for graduates of a bachelors degree plastics  engineering
              technology program must include skills in plastics  materials, design and
              processing, and the graduate must also be  prepared to develop and present new
              ideas. As a cornerstone to the  program of study, the students 1) use leading
              edge computer  technologies, including solid modeling, finite element analysis,
               mold flow, mold cooling and polymer flow, 2) have a comprehensive  laboratory
              experience resulting in a understanding of the operation  of processing
              machinery and proper processing condition to produce  high quality parts, 3)
              are required to develop and manage an  engineering project, 4) present the
              project before their peers and  professionals in their field.  The purpose of
              this proposal is to  obtain modern laboratory plastics processing equipment
              that will  substantially enhance the undergraduate plastics processing 
              laboratory experience. The requests consists of an extrusion blow  molder, a
              set of blow molds to demonstrate process capabilities,  and the acquisition of
              a computer simulation package to relate  simulation analysis and laboratory
              experience. The justification  for this equipment is based on the innovative
              way in which it will  be used to improve undergraduate students learning
              experience in  plastics processing.
