Abstract    :
              9450562  De los Santos  The Phoenix USI focuses on linkages and communication
              among the  independent school districts within the city of Phoenix.  The 
              initiative proposes to reform teaching and learning of science,  mathematics,
              and technology in the Phoenix inner city by creating  a "seamless web" of
              administrative, and instructional support  services.  Using the Maricopa
              Comprehensive Regional Center for  Minorities (CRCM) model of school clusters,
              built upon feeder  patters, as a basis for addressing communication and
              articulation  between the initial participating districts and among grade 
              levels.  It is anticipated that this model will assist Phoenix in  developing a
              continuum of K-12 programs and services designed to  prepare all students for
              success at the next grade level.  Over  the five year period of the award, the
              city will reform its  science and mathematics education delivery system for all
               students from elementary school through post-secondary education.  A Council
              of Superintendents, created to facilitate communication  among the
              participating independent school districts, elected one  member to represent
              them as Principal Investigator with overall  responsibility for project
              outcomes.
