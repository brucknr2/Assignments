              Project, Inc.  Cambridge, MA                                       Middle
              School Mathematics Literacy Project    Over the past several years, the Algebra
              Project, Inc. has been  developing a set of inquiry-oriented, experience-based
              middle  school materials designed to prepare minority youngsters to enter,  and
              successfully complete, a college track mathematics program in  high school. 
              The Algebra Project materials, designed to be used as  a supplement to other
              middle school curricula, are currently being  implemented in a number of
              (mainly urban) sites around the United  States.  The present project involves
              both implementation and  evaluation activities at just one set of sites in
              Mississippi,  primarily in the Spring Semester 1994.  The project targets some
              32  schools, including a few schools in Jackson, as well as many  isolated
              rural schools in the Delta.  Project staff supports the  implementation efforts
              of the 78 teachers by periodic workshops,  meetings, and class visitations, as
              well as the development of a  broad-based community support system that
              includes school  administrators, parents, and community leaders.  Concurrent
              with  the implementation efforts, a national panel of 6 evaluation  experts is
              conducting an intensive short-term evaluation study to  look at the Algebra
              Project materials themselves, as well as the  Mississippi Delta implementation
              model--with a view to determining  the replicability of this model.     Non-NSF
              contributions to this project are 10% of the NSF   contribution.
