Abstract    :
              9450237  Gregory    Improvement of the decision-making skills of secondary
              school students is an important component of the educational reform movement. 
              It is also a component in the education of workers for the competitive
              workforce.  In a previously-funded, exploratory grant, modules were developed
              for a variety of disciplines in which the content was taught by also
              emphasizing decision skills. This project builds upon that base to further
              develop, test and evaluate content-specific modules which teach the eight
              decision skills.  Decision skills are interwoven with subject-based material. 
              Students are placed in the role of active decision makers, faced with problems
              confronting scientists: interpreting conflicting outcomes, understanding
              sources of uncertainty, knowing when to go ahead despite a lack of information
              and when it is necessary to seek out additional information, distinguishing
              personal from professional values and knowing how best to work with a team of
              colleagues, possessing diverse skills, all of whom may see the world a little
              differently.  The project is done with teachers in Eugene, Oregon and other
              locations. Results to date indicate that students and teachers find the
              materials engaging and that the learning of science becomes more relevant.  The
              materials include discipline-specific modules which link decision-making
              skills, serving as an introduction to both the science and the decision-making
              and a decision skills handbook and video for teachers to see how to augment
              traditional science teaching.     ***
