Abstract    :
              9450042  Honey    This project, Telementoring Young Women in Engineering and
              Computing, is a collaboration  between the Center for Children and Technology
              (CCT), the Department of Energy's Office of  Scientific Computing, and Bolt,
              Beranek, and Newman's NSF-funded National Testbed Project.   The project
              develops a telementoring environment to encourage young women in secondary 
              schools to pursue careers in engineering and computing.  CCT will develop
              telecommunications  environments that enable high school girls in technical
              courses to communicate on an ongoing  basis with successful women professionals
              and college students.  These environments will be  designed to provide girls
              with the validation and advice that may not be available in traditional 
              educational settings.  CCT will also develop informational parent forums and an
              electronic  archive of existing exemplar equity materials to assist parents and
              teachers in supporting girls'  pursuits in engineering and computing. 
              Following the research and development phase, the  telementoring project will
              be implemented nationally through the Department of Energy's  Adventures in
              Supercomputing program.  ***
