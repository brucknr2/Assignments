Abstract    :
              Abstract 576  Huray  High Performance Computational Network Expansion Plan   
              South Carolina EPSCoR will establish a High Performance  Computational Network
              Expansion Plan to provide computational  tools, training, and programming
              support to a broad array of  junior faculty at several of the State's senior
              institutions,  including Clemson University, the Medical University of South 
              Carolina, the University of South Carolina, South Carolina State  University,
              the College of Charleston, and USC-Aiken.  Effective  access to the South
              Carolina Supercomputer Network will be  provided to computational researchers,
              graduate and undergraduate  students, and South Carolina's industrial sector. 
              The project  will provide research opportunities to junior faculty and will 
              expand the South Carolina Supercomputer Network through the  purchase and
              linking of onsite workstations.  In support of this  project, the participating
              institutions will appoint six graduate  fellowships in high performance
              computational science.  Systemic  and potential long-term impacts include the
              transfer of new  knowledge to non-competitive faculty and the coalescing of the
               educational agendas of South Carolina's leading institutions of  higher
              education with those of the state's industrial sector.
