Abstract    :
              9450874  Misra                                                          In most
              universities, parallel computing is treated as a highly  specialized area of
              knowledge that is taught only to computer  science graduate students.  This
              prevents undergraduate students in  other disciplines from receiving formal
              instruction in an area that  could prove to be very useful for solving complex
              problems in their  own fields.  An emphasis on interdisciplinary education and
              the  excellent undergraduate students at the Colorado School of Mines  provide
              an ideal environment for the development of a course that  attempts to rectify
              the above shortcoming.  This project is a new  course that is designed to teach
              parallel computing to  undergraduate scientists and engineers.  The students in
              the course  work in collaboration with research mentors to design and implement
               parallel solutions to problems of their choice.  The course teaches  students
              key issues in parallel computing design and analysis of  parallel algorithms,
              hardware considerations, software  considerations, parallel programming, and
              visualization of results.   This project requires parallel hardware, a graphics
              workstation,  and software to enhance the hands-on learning experience of the 
              students taking this course.  It is expected that the knowledge of  parallel
              computing will make the students more valuable  contributors to industry and
              better researchers.  In addition, it  is expected that this course will prove
              to be a model that can be  used by other schools that are dedicated to
              enhancing undergraduate  education in science and engineering.
