Abstract    :
              9450721  Banchoff                             Third semester calculus of two and
              more variables can be taught  most effectively when classroom lectures and
              texts are  supplemented by interactive computer graphics laboratories. The 
              laboratory materials already developed at Brown University for  introductory
              differential geometry using a network of SUN  workstations can now be
              redesigned, using recent electronic book  technology, so that it can run on
              Macintosh level computers.   This will make the visualization software
              available to a much  larger range of institutions and students, in engineering,
               natural sciences, life sciences, and economics, as well as  computer science
              and mathematics.
