Abstract    :
              9450532  York  This project investigates the use of virtual reality technology
              as  an aid in the development of abstract concepts from mathematics and 
              physical science in African-American students at the secondary  school level. 
              These students will explore in a multi-modal fashion  abstract concepts which
              derive from the very basic notions of  polygons and polyhedra(geometry),
              permutation groups(algebra), path  in a graph (topology), counting and
              estimation (combinatorics), and  motion and forces(Mechanics).  In this pilot
              project virtual  reality technology is investigated as a tool in developing
              multi-  modal (visual, tactile, and auditory) learning experiences for 
              primarily low-verbal learners.  Two starter VR environments will be  developed
              and tested over the next year.  The goal of the project  is to begin to
              understand the non-verbal acquisition and use of  abstract mathematical,
              physical, and algorithmic concepts as  demonstrated through motoric responses.
