Abstract    :
              9450007  Rodger    This model project seeks to attract and retain women in the
              computer science pipeline through  a variety of activities targeted at students
              from high school through graduate school.  High  school teachers and faculty
              from Rensselaer are to be involved.  There are plans to connect 20  local high
              schools to the University by providing computer accounts at Rensselaer for the
              high  school teachers and females students at these schools, with access via
              modems or networks.  The  female undergraduate and graduate students, as well
              as faculty in the computer science  department, will participate in electronic
              discussions and activities with the high schools.   Women at different stages
              in the pipeline will serve as mentors and/or mentees, receiving  knowledge from
              those further along, and passing it to those below.  In addition to the
              electronic  network, activities for the high schools include talks by female
              computer science professors and  female graduate students about their research
              and their field, three workshops for professors  from the University and high
              school teachers to plan activities, and a two-week summer  program.  Additional
              activities for female undergraduates and graduate students include transition 
              programs, formal seminars by distinguished female computer scientists, informal
              meetings for  discussion of issues, and a 10-week summer research program for
              undergraduates.    Women are underrepresented in the field of computer science,
              particularly at the highest levels.  The goal of the proposed work is to
              attract high school women to computer science, and to  retain interested women
              in the computer science pipeline from high school through graduate  programs. 
              Dissemination plans include sharing key components of the effort with the
              chairs of  computer science departments at universities within the U.S. to
              enable them to replicate  applicable aspects.  ***
