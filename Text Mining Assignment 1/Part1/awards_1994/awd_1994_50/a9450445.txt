Abstract    :
              9450445  The proposed research would be directed at (1) characterization  of
              high affinity choline transporter (2) gonadal hormones and  neuropeptide Y
              receptors in rats  (3) identification and  characterization of endogenous
              neuromodulators in Aplysia and (4)  conditioning related acetylcholine release
              in rat necortex.   The proposed work would also help expand research
              capabilities  and training opportunities in physiology, with an emphasis in 
              neuroscience, at Meharry Medical College.
