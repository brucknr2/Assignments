Abstract    :
                9450526  POODRY    The Regents of the University of California propose to
              conduct a 2 1/2 day workshop  focusing on educational issues and barriers
              experienced by rural poor Hispanic and  American Indian students.  The proposal
              will be under the direction of Dr. Clifton Poodry.   The director plans to
              convene a small group (~200) composed of representatives from a  variety of
              professional societies concerned with educational issues of these groups, as
              well  as representatives of Hispanic and American Indian educational
              activities.  The conference  proposes to focus on a medium for interaction
              among the participants, and on enhancing  the participants  understanding of
              systemic approaches to educational reform, as well as  providing insight and
              recommendations to the National Science Foundation in the further  development
              of the Rural Systemic Initiative.  ***
