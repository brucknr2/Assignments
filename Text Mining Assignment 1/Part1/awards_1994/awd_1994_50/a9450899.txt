Abstract    :
              9450899  Seidman  The Chemistry and Department of Randolph-Macon Woman's College
              has  purchased lasers and associated instrumentation to support the 
              development of a new senior level laboratory sequence in the  Chemistry
              Department and to also strengthen the intermediate level  laboratories in the
              Physics Departments. Students in both  departments are  being introduced to a
              variety of laser  applications, including fluorescence and luminescence studies
              and  Raman spectroscopy. The students are gaining experience with the  use of
              monochromators, lock-in detection and digital oscilloscopes.  This project goes
              a long way towards both strengthening and  modernizing the laboratory offerings
              of both departments, and  providing our students with an exciting array of
              state-of-the-art  experiences.
