Abstract    :
              9450750  Dubinsky                                                               
                   This project is engaging in assessment, evaluation and research  into how
              students learn mathematical concepts to determine effects  of the calculus
              reform curriculum and dissemination activities from  the previously supported
              Calculus project at Purdue. Assessment  activities will be closely related to
              research into how students  learn mathematical concepts and will also include
              studies of the  effect of the role of the teacher when changed from instructor
              to  facilitator and the use of group learning.  Current dissemination  approach
              will include the preparation of an Instructor's Resource  Manual, workshops and
              the continued growth and development of a  network of implementers. A model
              will also be developed for  evaluation of student attitudes, performance, and
              conceptual  understanding in comparison with students who took calculus in 
              standard models.
