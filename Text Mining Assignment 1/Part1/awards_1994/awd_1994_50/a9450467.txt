Abstract    :
              SSC-9450467  Cal State U Fresno Fnd  Fresno, CA  Shaw, Elden and Juanita
              Muniz-Torres    "Summer Science Camp"    The proposed Summer Science Camp (SSC)
              at California State  University, (CSUF), will help to address the
              underrepresentation of  ethnic minorities in science, engineering, and math
              careers.   Specifically, the proposed program will serve 48 underrepresented 
              minority middle school students per year for three years and will  consist of
              three components:  1) A four-week summer residential  program at CSUR; 2)
              Academic year follow-up; and 3) Project  assessment and evaluation of both the
              summer program and academic  year follow-up activities.  This is the second
              submission of this  proposal.  Suggestions made by the reviewers for enhancing
              the  proposal have been carefully considered and the proposal has been  revised
              to reflect their comments.  The summer program will provide  students
              experience in the following areas: 1) Integrated  coursework in algebra and
              geometry; 2) Engineering concepts and  laboratory activities; 3) Computer
              literacy; 4) Computer aided  design; 5) Refinement/development of oral and
              written communication  skills; and 60 Career exploration.    The successful
              implementation of integrated math, science, and  laboratory experiences will be
              assured through the use of  Mathematics Applications Curriculum for Science,
              Engineering and  Technology (MACSET) activities.  These unique hands-on
              experiences  approach problem solving using practical applications found in 
              everyday life, such as electrical appliances.  The academic year  follow-up
              activities will be directly linked with the proven CSUF  Mathematics
              Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) Program.  MESA  is a statewide program
              that addresses the need to increase the  number of underrepresented minorities
              pursuing college degrees in  math, engineering and science.  The CSUF MESA
              Program has several  components already in place that will provide academic
              year support  to summer program participants.  These areas in clude:  1)
              In-school  MESA clubs; 2) Saturday Academies; 3) Academic advising; 4) Career 
              speakers, mentoring, and role models; and 5) Field trips to  industry and
              universities.  ***
