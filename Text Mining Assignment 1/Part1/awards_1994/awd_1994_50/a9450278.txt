Abstract    :
              9450278  Boynton    The Engineering Design Experience (EDE) - designing,
              constructing,  testing and evaluating, and communicating - is incorporated in 
              three, 6-8 week units for middle school students.  Each unit is  based on a
              "technological challenge" which requires the students to  work as a design team
              to build and present their solutions to the  challenge.  The design challenges
              include development of a toy, a  vehicle and an amusement park ride at sixth,
              seventh and eighth  grades respectively.  The materials engage students in
              authentic  engineering challenges which become the context for learning 
              mathematics, science, technology education, social sciences and  language arts
              concepts and skills appropriate to middle school  students.  The students,
              teachers and community members form  learning teams in which students assume
              various engineering and  marketing roles.  The products include print
              materials, hands-on  kits, and videos and videodisc reference materials,
              complemented by  software tools.  The materials are brought to schools by
              engineers  from industry who interact with the students and teachers as they 
              engage the challenges.    ***
