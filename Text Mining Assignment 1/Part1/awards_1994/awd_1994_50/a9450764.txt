Abstract    :
              9450764  Gaffney  A regional center for calculus reform is being established in
              the  Boston area centered at Northeastern University. As part of this  effort,
              curriculum reforms are being made to the multivariable and  differential
              equation courses, and throughout the full range of  calculus and precalculus
              courses. The completed reforms will affect  over 150 sections; over 15,000
              students will enroll in these  courses in the next 5 years.  Working with
              Northeastern's Comprehensive Regional Center for  Minorities, the project is
              strengthening and helping create  precalculus and calculus programs in public
              high schools in the  City of Boston, and other urban school districts with
              large  minority enrollments. As an incentive for students and teachers to  join
              this program, Northeastern will award credit to all high  school students
              completing a calculus course through this program.  There will also be a
              regional network of school teachers and  college faculty committed to the
              adaptation and dissemination of  the ideas and techniques of the reform
              movement, reaching thousands  of area students. This network will maintain a
              software and  materials library and sponsor seminars, workshops, and regional 
              conferences.
