Abstract    :
              9450342  The proposed research would apply statistical mechanics methods  to
              analyze various properties of diffusive motion in disordered  systems.
              Properties such as reaction rates, displacement moments,  mobilities and
              distances between mobile reactants and fixed traps  will be evaluated. The
              overall goal is to create a strong  condensed matter theory group, which would
              provide solid research  experience and motivation to students,furnish support
              to  experimentalists in material sciences, and strengthen the  cooperation with
              other institutions.
