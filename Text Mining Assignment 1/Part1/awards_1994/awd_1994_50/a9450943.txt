Abstract    :
              9450943  Essick                                                    The Reed
              College Physics Department will implement a major  improvement of its
              upper-division instructional laboratory course  (Physics 331/332 Advanced
              Laboratory). This course is a major  component of the curriculum for
              junior-level physics majors and is  of vital importance in outfitting them with
              the ideas, tools and  experiences necessary to competently execute their Senior
              Theses,  the year-long independent research projects undertaken by all 
              fourth-year Reed students. Improvement of the Advanced Laboratory  will be
              realized through the development of eight modern physics  experimental stations
              and an updated presentation of  computer-assisted data acquisition and analysis
              (facilitated by  three new LabView systems). The eight stations will be
              constructed  from building-block components including a monochromatic light 
              source, digitizing oscilloscope, high resolution spectrometer, 
              temperature-controlled cryostat, tunable laser diode, multi-channel  analyzer
              and lock-in amplifier. A guided experiment will be  developed for each new
              station. Each of these experiments will  illustrate a physical concept of
              contemporary scientific importance  via research-style measurement methods and
              will provide experience  with generic data analysis techniques. The
              component-type nature of  these stations also will allow students to easily
              alter the  experimental parameters in search of new effects and to modify the 
              setups for independent projects. With the addition of these  flexible
              component-type stations, the Advanced Laboratory will  better fulfill its dual
              purpose of exposing junior-level physics  majors to the concerns and techniques
              of modern experimental  physics research and developing their skills as
              autonomous  researchers. Additionally, these stations will serve as a resource 
              for physics Thesis students.
