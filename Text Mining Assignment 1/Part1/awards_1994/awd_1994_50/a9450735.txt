Abstract    :
              9450735  Lepowsky                                 The Peralta Community College
              District, San Francisco City College,  California State University-Hayward, and
              San Francisco  State  University are forming a consortium to jointly revitalize
               instruction in calculus by adapting the Harvard Calculus  Curriculum.  Faculty
              from each institution are jointly developing  the curriculum  which will
              incorporate instructional methods and  strategies that have proven to be
              effective in increasing the  success rate of  calculus students. The results
              are being published  in a Calculus Reform Handbook. The respective mathematics 
              departments are working to institutionalize the developed reform  curriculum in
              all calculus classes at the four institutions. In  addition, the core group are
              developing a preparation program for  mathematics faculty who have not
              participated in the curriculum  development effort.
