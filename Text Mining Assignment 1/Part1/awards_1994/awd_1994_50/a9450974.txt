Abstract    :
              9450974  Rennels  The goal of this project is to enhance the capability of the 
              Manufacturing Technology Quality Control Laboratory. This facility  is utilized
              by undergraduate technology students to investigate the  various types of
              dimensional metrology instruments and  nondestructive testing techniques which
              are used in industrial  quality control. This project expands the capability of
              the  laboratory by providing geometric measuring capability in addition  to the
              present linear measuring instruments. The equipment  requested includes
              instruments to determine both circular and  linear geometries with contact-type
              instruments which are currently  not available. The equipment will allow the
              development of a new  course in advanced metrology. Also, this proposal
              requests funds  for instruments which will expand the nondestructive testing 
              capability of the laboratory through the acquisition of equipment  currently
              not available and which will supplement the current  instruments.
