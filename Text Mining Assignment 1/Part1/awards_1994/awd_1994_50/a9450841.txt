Abstract    :
              9450841  Landau                                                              The
              project substantially enhances the computer lab component of  the Computational
              Physics class developed and taught for six years.  Specifically, the number of
              X-terminals and the number of CPU's are  increased.  The three-fourfold
              increase in power and access permits  the inclusion of computational tools into
              the general physics  curriculum -- in parallel with the Computational Physics
              class--  and eliminates bottlenecks when the entire class works on 
              numerically-intensive projects. All the high performance  workstations in the
              physics department are being connected with the  two new ones, and then the
              Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) software  will run on all machines. This will
              create a powerful, distributed  memory parallel computer which gives students
              needed experience in  message passing and synchronization primitives.  The
              additional  facility has also permitted the extension of the Computational 
              Physics course to an extra term, and thus continue the development  of projects
              which can be used throughout the physics curriculum.   Finally, the equipment
              strengthens and broadens the Physics  Department's computing resources as a
              means to assist in the  development of an interdisciplinary Computational
              Science program.
