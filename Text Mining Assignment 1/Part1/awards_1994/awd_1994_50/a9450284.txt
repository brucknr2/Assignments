Abstract    :
              SSC-9450284  Wentworth Institute of Tech  Boston, MA  Newhouse, Joyce    "Camp
              Tech II"    Massachusetts Pre-Engineering Program, Inc. (MassPEP) in 
              collaboration with Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT), the  Boston Housing
              Authority (BHA) and the Boston Public Elementary  Schools propose the model
              program Camp Tech II.  The purpose of  this program is to stimulate the
              curiosity and interest of students  (grades 7-9) in math, science and
              technology, Camp Tech II presents  an integrated math and science curriculum
              through hands-on projects  in robotics, computer applications, architecture,
              construction  science, electronics and environmental science.  The program
              format  includes a 6-week full day summer camp and 5 Saturday programs  during
              the school year.  The underlying theme of the camp  curriculum is how thing
              break, how things work, how things are  built and how people solve problems. 
              The curriculum is a joint  effort of MassPEP, WIT faculty, classroom teachers
              from the  collaborating school zones and industry professionals.  The Camp 
              Tech II program completed its pilot year (1993).  The academic  components of
              this program are balanced by physical fitness program  that enables students to
              learn about the importance of good health  and team efforts as they use math
              and science principles to chart  their scores, speeds and distances.  No
              country can afford to  pretend that a majority of its citizens are barely able
              to learn  simple arithmetic, everyday science and technology applications.  
              Young students need to be encouraged to maintain their natural  interest in the
              world around them and they need to see how this  world can be measured,
              predicted, and changed through the  application of various technologies and
              systems of discovery.
