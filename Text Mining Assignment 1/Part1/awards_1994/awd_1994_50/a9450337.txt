Abstract    :
              SSC-9450337  Rutgers U. New Brunswick  Camden, NJ  Jackson, Lambert, Leland
              Butler and Jesse Whitlow    "PACE III Summer Science Camp"    PACE III: 
              Science in the city will be conducted in four one-week  phases, three of which
              will each focus on the study of one  scientific discipline.  An umbrella social
              science course will help  focus students on the relevance of the studies to
              them and their  lives.  The primary purpose of the project will be to promote
              and  generate scientific interest in forty-five (45) ninth grade  students from
              the city of Camden.  The camp will build on the PACE  I and II Programs for
              one-third of the students and will serve as  an introductory science program to
              new participants.  It will  provide practical exposure and hands on experience
              to scientific  disciplines through the study of existing facilities that
              provide  urban services.  Experiments and lectures will be conducted around 
              how these operations work and their importance to urban  development.  An
              integral part of the Camp will be two related  components that will build on
              survival skills; the first will be  group counseling sessions and the second,
              which will involve  parents, will focus on building family strategies for
              success.
