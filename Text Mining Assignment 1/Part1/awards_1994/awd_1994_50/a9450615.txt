Abstract    :
              9450615  Treichel                                                               
                      A consortium led by the Chemistry Department of the University of 
              Wisconsin-Madison will develop a new chemistry curriculum that will  have three
              major components: integrating general, analytical, and  organic chemistry into
              a two-year sequence built around a  topic-oriented approach; introducing
              active-learning techniques  such as cooperative group learning, discovery
              learning, and  computer-aided instruction into all courses throughout the 
              curriculum; and developing a variety of  intellectual tools that  students can
              apply effectively to significant problems, and that  can be packaged and
              disseminated to a variety of institutions.  A  large number of individuals
              representing a wide variety of types of  institutions will participate in a
              curriculum planning conference  that will generate a large set of ideas from
              which specific  curriculum reforms can be developed.  In two subsequent
              workshops  a smaller group will select the best of these ideas and develop a 
              plan for comprehensive curriculum reform.  UW-Madison's tradition  of
              commitment and excellence in undergraduate chemistry education,  our ability to
              attract many excellent chemists/educators as  participants in the planning
              conference, and our established means  of dissemination make us uniquely suited
              to carry out curriculum  reform.
