Abstract    :
              An algorithm is said to be online if it receives input in a  sequence of
              requests, and must service each request as it arrives  without any knowledge of
              the future.  Many fundamental problems in  computer science are inherently
              online.  A commonly used method of  analyzing online algorithms is competitive
              analysis, where the  performance of the online algorithm is compared to the
              performance  of the optimal clairvoyant algorithm.  There are several practical
               problems with the usual style of competitive analysis, including   the use of
              worst care adversary, the lack of attention to  implementation efficiency, and
              the lack of empirical evidence  concerning the performance of competitive
              algorithms.  The goal of  this project is to help bridge the gap between theory
              and practice  in this rapidly growing area by developing efficient, adaptive 
              algorithms for fundamental systems problems.  These algorithms  should perform
              well against a statistical adversary, and will be  empirically evaluated.   
              Interactive activities include:  participation in the mentoring and  outreach
              programs of Women in Engineering; development of and  experimentation with
              software for teaching math to girls, via  collaboration with Professor Steve
              Tanimoto's research group at the  University of Washington (UW) and with
              Professor Maria Klawe's E-  GEMS project at the University of British Columbia;
              and teaching an  undergraduate course and seminars in computer science and 
              undertaking joint research with other members of the computer  science faculty
              at UW.
