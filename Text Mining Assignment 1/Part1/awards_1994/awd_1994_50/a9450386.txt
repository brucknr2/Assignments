Abstract    :
              9450386  The proposed research would support investigations with respect  to
              surface structure and dynamics of transition metal surfaces as  well as larger
              fullerenes and their variants.  The proposal seeks  to enhance the
              inter-disciplinary interactions between the  molecular dynamics group and the
              wavelet based methods for signal  and image processing group that are part of
              the Center for  Theoretical Studies of Physical Systems. The proposed work
              would  have an impact on the training of minority undergraduate,  graduate and
              post-graduate students in physics and chemistry.
