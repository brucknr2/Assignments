Abstract    :
                94-50226    Lemme                                  The Philadelphia Urban
              Systemic Initiative team proposes to carry  out a three-part program to: 1)
              produce several "prototypical"  networks to be used for the development and
              dissemination of  specific components of the overall USI K-12 SMT reform; 2)
              work  with the schools to ensure that the State-mandated School  Improvement
              Plan (SIP) be used as a guide to direct and replicate  the reforms systemwide;
              and 3) complete a self-study of the current  state of SMT education in the
              District and begin systemwide  implementation of the components developed by
              their team.   These  activities will be undertaken by a team composed of
              members of the  Philadelphia School District, led by the Superintendent, PSD,
              and  two PDs, working with key stakeholders in the community, and in 
              partnership with the Franklin Institute.  Completion of the self-  study and
              the implementation of the USI plan will be accomplished  through the use of
              several task forces composed of District staff  and representatives of key
              stakeholders charged with these tasks.
