Abstract    :
              Research activities will focus on geodesic behavior in 2-step  nilpotent metric
              Lie groups.  One successful approach to studying  the geometry of a given Lie
              group is to examine the algebraic  structure of its associated Lie algebra. 
              Particular emphasis will  be given to Lie groups which are singular. 
              Singularity is  determined by the singularity of a set of skew-symmetric linear
               transformations defined on the center of the associated Lie  algebra.  Dr.
              Maura Mast intends to use apply previous methods used  in the study of the
              geometry of 2-step nilpotent nonsingular Lie  groups to the study of singular
              Lie groups.  She also intends to  apply her results on lengths of closed
              geodesics in 2-step  nilmanifolds to problems in spectral geometry.   
              Interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate level  Differentiable
              Manifolds course and a beginning Calculus course;  participating actively in
              seminars at Northeastern University and  other school in the Boston area;
              working with Northeastern  University to develop methods to recruit and retain
              math majors;  and initiating discussion and support groups for women in science
               and mathematics.
