Abstract    :
              SSC-9450535  U of NC Greensboro  Greensboro, NC  Goldfarb, Allan, Thomas
              Martinek and Dennis Quick    "The UNCG Summer Sport Science Camp"    Funding is
              sought to support a four week, non-residential summer  science camp for middle
              school children of undeserved populations  with demonstrated potential for
              leadership in sports who have yet  to demonstrate the same potential for
              science or math.  By showing  how science and math can be used to improve sport
              performances,  investigators hope to capitalize on the popularity of sports as
              a  vehicle for establishing scientific concepts and as a tool for  motivating
              students to study both science and math.  A total of 48  students from 16
              schools in the North Carolina region served by  University of North Carolina
              Greensboro, known as the Piedmont  Triad region will be served by this program.
               Science, mathematics  and physical education teachers from each school will
              participate  in intensive laboratory activities designed to teach basic
              concepts  about exercise physiology and sport biomechanics, along with  various
              physical activities designed to integrate performance with  science and math. 
              Teachers will attend a five day precamp workshop  as preparation.  Teachers and
              the principal investigators will work  together to design sport science
              experiences for the schools'  science clubs.  Students who were initially
              enrolled in the camp  will be brought back to the University's laboratories for
              special  enrichment activities during the academic year.  This project  builds
              on experience gained in a 1992 sport science camp designed  for high school
              students that was funded through the NSF-funded  Statewide Systemic Initiative
              Program.   ***
