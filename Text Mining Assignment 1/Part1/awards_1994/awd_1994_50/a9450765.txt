Abstract    :
              9450765  Ostebee                                                                
               A curriculum and materials development project focusing on  multivariate
              calculus builds on and extends the work by the PI's on  single variable
              calculus.  Faculty at St. Olaf College are writing,  field-testing, and
              disseminating complete course materials,  including a textbook, for a rethought
              multivariable calculus course  that emphasizes the development of conceptual
              understanding and  analytical reasoning skills. The course and its supporting 
              materials share a pervasive mathematical theme and a consistent  pedagogical
              strategy: to combine, compare, and move among  graphical, numerical, and
              algebraic viewpoints on calculus.  Graphical, numerical, and symbolic computing
              technology is used to  support this emphasis.  The materials use technology
              freely but are not bound to any  specific hardware or software platform.  The
              technology  requirements are defined generically in terms of functionalities, 
              rather than by brand name.  The text assumes that students have  access to
              technology that has at least the capabilities of a CAS.   Specific applications
              to a particular CAS can be found in  supplements and lab manuals.
