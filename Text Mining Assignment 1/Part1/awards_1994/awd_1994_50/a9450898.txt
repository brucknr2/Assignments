Abstract    :
              9450898  Takach  This project strengthens the curricular content of introductory
               circuits and electronics laboratories through the study of  frequency domain
              concepts. These entry level courses constitute the  laboratory studies segment
              of the EE Core Curriculum required of  electrical engineering majors at Seattle
              University.  Fourier  analyzers will allow students to build an intuitive
              understanding  of frequency domain concepts in a wide variety of experimental 
              situations. Such intuition will be developed by means of on-screen 
              visualization and measurements that are currently not possible with  our
              existing equipment.  We plan to incorporate the analyzers'  spectral and
              network capabilities into a set of new experiments.  These experiments will be
              centered around the use and design of  operational amplifiers and op-amp
              circuits, thereby motivating the  study of traditional amplifier configurations
              as well. This  thematic approach will connect the circuits and electronics 
              laboratory experiences into a cohesive whole.
