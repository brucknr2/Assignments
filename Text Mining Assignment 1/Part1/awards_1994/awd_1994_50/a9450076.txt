Abstract    :
              9350076  Carpenter & Fennema    The purpose of this project is to conduct
              theoretical analysis and  pilot work on teachers' knowledge of children's
              mathematical  thinking in grades 3-5.  The goal of the project is to refine the
               conceptual basis of Cognitively Guided Instruction to the upper  elementary
              grades and demonstrate the feasibility and potential  contribution that such an
              extension would make.  the contributions  include: i) extending the contend
              focus of previous work CGI grades  K-2 to the complexity of mathematics in
              grades 3-5, with special  attention focused on children's understanding of
              rational number  concepts; and ii) identifying what components of the CGI
              approach  to staff development, other than knowledge of children's 
              mathematical thinking, are critical.  ***
