Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing computer equipment to  upgrade the
              control interface of two computer-controlled  instruments: a FT-IR and a
              mid-field FT-NMR.  These two instruments  find heavy use in our
              project-oriented laboratories at the  sophomore, junior, and senior levels. 
              Throughout the program  students undertake extended multistage laboratory
              projects  requiring them to display a growing independence.  In the sophomore 
              year, which is the primary beneficiary of the project, the students  select a
              multistage synthesis from the original current research  literature to
              investigate.  Examples of recent projects are  synthesis of a pheromone of the
              western pine beetle, and of a model  compound for the antioxidant
              alpha-tocopherol.  Both the number and  sophistication of IR and NMR spectra
              are increasing with the new  interfaces; sophomores are  able to run their own
              2 - D NMR spectra  by the end of the year, and students in the upper-level 
              laboratories use the full capabilities of both instruments in  characterizing
              compounds prepared in their projects.
