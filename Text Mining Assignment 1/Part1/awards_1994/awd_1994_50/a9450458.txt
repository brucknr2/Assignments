Abstract    :
              9450458  McBay    This project addresses the need to assess the status of the 
              mathematics and science teacher education programs at predominantly  minority
              institutions to determine what changes, if any, are  required to ensure that
              future graduates of these institutions and  current teachers who receive
              in-service training from these  institutions are able to provide the quality of
              mathematics and  science instruction needed by today's students.    The Quality
              Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will convene a  conference of
              approximately 80 people from among the Deans of the  School of Education or
              Chairs of the Department of Education and  Chairs of the Mathematics, Biology,
              Chemistry, or Physics  Departments at 20 minority institutions that are major
              producers of  minority teachers.    Conference participants will assess the
              status of the current  mathematics and science teacher education programs at
              these  institutions; discuss national teacher and mathematics and science 
              curriculum standards and challenges in meeting them; learn about  advanced
              instructional technologies and model strategies at  participating institutions;
              and identify potential strategies and  collaborations to ensure the production
              of graduates who can meet  the standards expected.    Conference Proceedings
              will be produced and broadly disseminated.   A special target audience for the
              Proceedings will be other  predominantly minority colleges and universities
              with teacher  education programs throughout the country.
