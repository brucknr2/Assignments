Abstract    :
              9450951  Bopp  The project will purchase a Dual Beam Atomic Absorption 
              Spectrometer for use in a variety of chemistry courses.  These  include
              Quantitative analysis, Ecology, Field Biology, and Advanced  laboratory.  The
              equipment will enhance student skills and  experience with this important
              instrumental technique, and more  students will be able to study a wider range
              of chemical phenomena  than is possible with existing equipment.  This
              development will  fit curricular goals of the department including: 1. To
              continually  update lecture material in all courses to reflect advances in the 
              field of chemistry; 2. To strengthen all laboratory courses by  providing
              hands-on experience with modern instrumentation of the  quality and type
              comparable to that used in research and industry;  3. To enrich the Chemistry
              Department program by providing  increased opportunities for students to engage
              in independent  projects using research quality instrumentation; 4. To acquaint
              the  students with modern techniques in computational analysis and  computer
              data acquisition methods; 5. To upgrade existing equipment  for purposes of
              increased efficiency and versatility in all  laboratory courses.
