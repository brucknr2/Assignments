Abstract    :
              SSC-9450417  Stanislaus County Office of Education  Modesto, CA  Byrd, Jim and
              Diggle, Pamela    "Project WATER"    The Stanislaus County Office of Education
              (SCOE) will operate a  Summer Science Camp (SSC) for 50 minority students from
              1994  through 1996.  Certificated Science/Math teachers will provide 
              instruction emphasizing the hands-on approach involving student  activities and
              projects.  Learning activities will center on the  theme of WATER, its
              multitude of uses and how it impacts our daily  lives.  Students will be housed
              in the Outdoor Education Center  which is located in the Sierra foothills. 
              This is an area rich in  geological examples, fossils, environmental issues,
              power  generating facilities and scientific stimuli.    Professional
              scientists, mathematicians, engineers and individuals  from related fields will
              participate in the instructional program  and serve as mentors.  They will
              focus upon the importance of  remaining in school, the selection of science and
              math courses and  the choice of careers available if the students pursue the
              path of  learning.    Selected students will matched with a control group on
              the basis of  ethnicity, gender, age, and community type (urban, small
              community,  and rural).  Comparisons will be made over a five-year span on 
              frequency of dropouts, selection of science and math courses in  high school,
              grades in these courses, attendance, and frequency of  attendance in higher
              education institutions.  The results of this  study will be disseminated to
              cooperating school districts,  supporting organizations, the National Science
              Foundation and  minority organizations such as the NAACP, the Hispanic
              Leadership  Council, The Asian Coalition, etc.  ***
