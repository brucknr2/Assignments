              proposed of two discrete panels of majority and minority doctoral  students,
              one consisting of beginning doctoral students, another of  doctoral students
              who have been admitted to candidacy,.  the  selected panels are drawn form
              doctoral student populations in four  different major graduate institutions who
              are pursuing doctoral  degrees in three different areas of inquiry: the
              physical sciences,  the social sciences, and the professions.
