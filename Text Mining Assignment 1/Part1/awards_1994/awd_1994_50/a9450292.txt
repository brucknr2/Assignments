Abstract    :
              9450292  Deutschman    The Greater Newark Alliance for Minority Participation
              consists of eleven colleges including four community/county  colleges and seven
              4 year colleges and universities. The lead institutions are the New Jersey
              Institute of Technology  and Rutgers University-Newark, with the partner
              colleges including Montclair State College, Kean College of New  Jersey,
              William Paterson College, Jersey City State College, Bloomfield College, Essex
              County College, Union  County College, Passaic County Community College, and
              Hudson County Community College. The Alliance will  be a partnership of these
              colleges along with industry, science centers, school boards, and interested
              members of  the scientific, civic, and governmental communities. The principal
              goal is to dramatically increase the opportunities  for minorities towards
              successful inclusion in science, engineering and mathematics disciplines, as
              measured by  undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.    In
              collaboration, the Greater Newark Alliance provides educationally,
              economically, and socially disadvantaged  minority students with a support
              system and learning environment structured to:          o   encourage the
              pursuit of a higher education in science, engineering or other math-based
              fields of study,            particularly in the alliance colleges and
              universities,        o   improve students' academic performance while in high
              school;        o   ease the transition from high school to college;        o  
              provide the support services needed to retain students once they are enrolled
              in college,        o   build self-esteem and self-confidence and raise
              aspirations;        o   increase students' awareness of science, engineering
              and mathematics related careers;        o   stimulate students' interest in
              research and in continuing for graduate studies,        o   ease the transition
              from college into the workforce.    The objective of the Alliance is to double
              the number of minority students successfully completing unde rgraduate  degrees
              in science, engineering and mathematics in the Alliance Colleges, and entering
              professional career or  graduate studies by the year 2000.    The target
              population focuses on Newark and its metropolitan area. Newark lies within 25
              miles of nine counties  in northeastern New Jersey with a total population of
              over 5 million. While the state of New Jersey has a 23%  minority population
              (African American and Latinos), Essex County (where four of the alliance
              colleges are located)  is comprised of a minority population of 54%. The 11
              alliance colleges are all located within 10 miles of Newark  and are within
              four adjacent counties:  Essex, Hudson, Union and Passaic.  The counties of
              Essex, Hudson and  Union make up a total population of 1,825,000 with 47% of
              all African Americans and 66% of all Latinos in the  state.  Evaluation of
              student's academic performance will include:          a)  number of minority
              students selecting math, science, computer science, engineering majors       
              b)  minority student grades in selected math and science courses at freshman,
              sophomore, junior, and senior            levels.        c)  minority GPAs
              within the overall major programs at the sophomore and junior level's and at
              graduation        d)  attrition/retention rates of minority students in the
              AMPS-related majors        e)  entry of minority graduates into AMPS-related
              graduate programs or careers    The goals of the Alliance will be achieved by
              adopting an inter-university/regional sharing of ideas, programs and  resources
              to facilitate the maximum use of physical, financial, and human resources for
              the common goal of  attraction and retention of minority students in the
              science, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.  Fifteen  programs are
              planned comprising a comprehensive plan for the Alliance including mentoring,
              tutoring,  undergraduate research experience, academic and financial support, a
              guarantee of "no cost" tuition, establishing  a minority scholars program and
              providing diversi ty training for all students, faculty and staffing the
              program.    Dissemination plans include an Alliance Newsletter, published four
              times a year, distributed to the Alliance partner  colleges for faculty and
              staff, interested mathematics and science teachers in the greater Newark area,
              scientists,  and others in industry, government, science education facilities,
              foundations, and persons interested in the project  and its outcomes.
