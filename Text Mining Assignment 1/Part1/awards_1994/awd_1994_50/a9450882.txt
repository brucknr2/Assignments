Abstract    :
              9450882  Walstrum                             Environmental Science is a
              multidisciplinary program that attracts  by far the largest number of science
              students at the University of  Dubuque. The number of students in the program
              has increased  dramatically in the last two years. One goal of the program is
              to  train students in environmental analysis. Ultraviolet-visible 
              spectrophotometry is widely used in analyzing inorganic substances  (e.g.,
              phosphate, chromium) in environmental samples. We will  purchase a diode-array
              UV-visible spectrophotometer that can obtain  a spectrum in seconds, and
              automatically acquire kinetic data.    We propose to use the instrument in a
              number of classes in the  chemistry and biology curriculum. In instructional
              labs, we will  use the instrument largely for quantitative analysis of
              chemicals  of environmental interest and examining the spectra of biological 
              pigments, and we will also use it for kinetics. In students'  independent
              projects, we will use the instrument for evaluating the  effectiveness of
              certain enzymes in degrading pollutants by  examining the kinetics of reaction.
               We believe that using environmental analysis in laboratory classes  is an
              effective way of increasing student interest in science, and  that the
              laboratory exercises that we are using can be adopted by  any science program
              whether or not they have course offerings in  environmental science or a major
              in environmental science.
