Abstract    :
              This project is establishing an undergraduate laboratory in which 
              computer-aided analysis and display will be used for instruction in 
              atmospheric sciences.  The facility allows the integration of  interactive
              analysis, manipulation and display of meteorological  data into the
              department's curriculum and serves an increasing  student population.  The
              department has already made considerable  efforts in software development,
              establishing a data acquisition  infrastructure, and in pilot attempts applying
              workstation analysis  in the classroom.  A considerable range of courses makes
              use of the  proposed facility, from introductory classes to predominantly 
              major's classes in synoptic meteorology, forecasting, and dynamics.   In
              addition, the new laboratory is increasing and enhancing the  undergraduate
              research opportunities in the department.  This  facility allows students to
              examine atmospheric structures and  processes with an ease and a level of
              detail not previously  possible and aids student understanding of the complex 
              three-dimensional structures of weather systems.  Considering the  department's
              substantial experience in meteorological software  development and data storage
              technologies, it is expected that the  laboratory software and instructional
              approaches that are developed  for the proposed facility will be important
              contributions to  undergraduate instruction in the discipline; these advances
              will be  made available to the entire atmospheric sciences community.
