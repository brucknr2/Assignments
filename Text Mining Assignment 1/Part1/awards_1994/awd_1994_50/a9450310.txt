Abstract    :
              9450310  Turchin    This project is a planning grant from two community school 
              districts in Manhattan, District 3 and 5.  They are proposing to  collaborate
              with the Workshop Center at City College of the City  University of New York,
              the NYC Central Board of Education, and the  Educational Development Center to
              plan a local systemic teacher  enhancement effort for improving the teaching
              and learning of  science in the elementary schools of both districts.  The
              grant  will allow the districts to conduct a better needs assessment which 
              would include examining staff abilities in terms of their teachers'  ability to
              use inquiry teaching methodologies knowledge of science  content and process,
              and ability to change.  They will also be  identifying possible lead teachers
              based on their willingness to  work with colleagues and ability to serve as
              mentors.  Once the  expertise has been identified a model will be developed
              which will  include:  designing the organizational structure; defining the 
              curriculum; identifying the content of the inservice; defining  avenues for
              collaboration with other NSF projects and community-  based agencies, including
              the USI effort, and coordinating with  informal science centers.  ***
