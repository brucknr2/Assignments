Abstract    :
              9450448  The proposed research would concentrate on two main areas of 
              computational mathematics: ( 1.) Design and Implementation of  Crystallographic
              Fast Fourier Transforms ( 2.) Structure of  Euclidean Distance Matrices and
              Optimization Problems. The  proposed research would strengthen the research
              capabilities of  the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez in the area of 
              computational mathematics.
