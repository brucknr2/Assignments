Abstract    :
              9450026  Cid    This project,  United Connecticut for Women in Science,
              Engineering, and Mathematics,  is directed toward making permanent changes in
              women's and girls' access to, and  participation and achievement in science,
              engineering and mathematics (SEM), especially  among economically disadvantaged
              and under-represented minority populations.  It will  develop and implement
              systemic change strategies reaching parents, teachers and  professors, guidance
              counselors and other school and college administrators, school board  members,
              community leaders, and students (K-18), building on existing resource and 
              advocacy efforts by professional organizations, stakeholder groups, state and
              local  education agencies, and institutions of higher education.  The project
              has four  components:  (1) a Clearinghouse for statewide resource building,
              research, symposia  and conferences, and dissemination of project products; 
              (2) a public awareness  component infusing Women in SEM issues in the state's
              Statewide Systemic Initiative  public awareness campaign and also creating
              local "equity partnerships";  (3) a "self-  esteem building" component offering
              three different approaches to supporting girls and  women in SEM at the
              elementary, secondary, and college levels;  and (4) a pre-service  and
              in-service component developing new curricula addressing Women in SEM issues 
              for future and practicing teachers, respectively.  ***
