Abstract    :
              SSC-9450343  Philadelphia School Dist.  Philadelphia, PA  Smith, Lynnette   
              "Central East Regional Science Camp"    For four weeks during the summers of
              1994, 1995, and 1996, the  School District of Philadelphia will conduct the
              "Central East  Regional Science Camp (CERSC)" at Edison High School for fifty 
              minority middle school students. CERSC, which will pool students  from nine
              middle schools in the Central East Region of the School  District, is designed
              to encourage minority students who may have  questioned their ability to "do"
              science, or questioned the  relevance of science in their daily lives, to
              understand how  science does relate to them, that careers in science are open
              to  them, and that staying in school and continuing their science  education is
              the best path to these careers.  Participants, who  will begin the project as
              upcoming seventh grade students, will  work with their peers and the project
              staff each summer to develop  science fair projects about the environment. 
              Project staff will  conduct activities in four major areas--research,
              laboratory work,  problem-solving, and computer skills--to help students with
              the  development of their projects, and will also take students on field  trips
              to environmental sites in the Philadelphia area.    During the school year,
              students will continue to develop their  science fair projects, meeting monthly
              with their "mentors,"  science teachers at their home-based schools, to get
              feedback on  their projects.  In March of every year of the project, the 
              participants will enter their science fair projects in the George  Washington
              Carver Science Fair.  Students will also participate  with their parents in the
              school-year Super Science Saturday  Academy programs held by the National
              Organization for the  Professional advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical
              Engineers  to learn about careers in science, mathematics, and engineering and 
              to participate in problem-solving, hands-on activities in science.
