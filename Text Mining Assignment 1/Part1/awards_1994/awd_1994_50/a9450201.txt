Abstract    :
              The Council on Undergraduate Research (UCR) is requesting funding  in the amount
              of $2,500 for travel grants to underrepresented  minorities to attend the Fifth
              National Conference of the Council  on Undergraduate Research which is
              scheduled to be held at Bates  College in June 1994.  The theme of this year's
              biennial national  conference is "The Bottom Line:  Creating and Maintaining a
              Healthy  Undergraduate Research Environment."  Particular attention will be 
              given to soliciting applications from black faculty at historically  black
              colleges and black faculty at primarily undergraduate  institutions.  There are
              three objectives proposed i this program.   The first objectives is to provide
              the opportunity for  underrepresented minority faculty at primarily
              undergraduate  institutions to learn more about funding opportunities and also
              to  learn about successful undergraduate research programs.  The second 
              objective is to bring the perspective of the black community into  the national
              dialogue of undergraduate research.  And the third  objective is to foster the
              involvement of black science faculty in  the organization of the Council on
              Undergraduate Research.
