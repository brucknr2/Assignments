Abstract    :
              SSC-9450348  Cal State L.A. Univ.  Los Angeles, CA  Cobb, Jewel    "Residential
              Intensive Math and Science Academy"    Residential Intensive Math and Science
              Academy (RIMSA) is a 4-week  residential program aimed at underrepresented
              seventh grade  students in Los Angeles.  The Academy will serve 50 students by 
              offering math, science, computers and expressive writing for  curricular
              enrichment.  Academic monitoring and follow-up will  occur through 8 Saturday
              Academy sessions.  The program will offer  an intensive experience for students
              who attend school on year-  round calendars and cannot participate in a
              traditional summer  program.  The curricular focus will be mathematics,
              scientific  inquiry, hands-on science, computer application, and creative 
              expression.      Students will be recruited primarily from ACCESS Center
              pipeline  schools representing low SES minority student populations.  Faculty 
              will be recruited from math, science and/or equivalent Education  and computer
              science departments at CSU Los Angeles and schools in  the ACCESS pipeline.  A
              Program Director also serving as the  outreach coordinator will administer the
              program and ensure active  parent participation.  ***
