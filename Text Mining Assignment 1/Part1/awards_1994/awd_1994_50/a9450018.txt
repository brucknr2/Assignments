Abstract    :
              9450018  Steinfeld  Women in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences,
              SUNY-  Stony Brook, together with colleagues throughout the University,  local
              industry, Brookhaven National Laboratory and three large  Suffolk County School
              districts will work together on this project.   In a multi-pronged effort to
              demonstrably affect 100 6th and 7th  grade middle school students activities
              include:  year-round,  campus, local school and community-based components, led
              by trained  EPWG Clud Advisors; linking distinguished scientists, 
              mathematicians and engineers with clubs through an "Adopt-a-Club"  modality;
              offering a mentor/mentee semester-long experience;  teacher-training and
              curriculum enhancement for middle school  staff; and parent empowerment through
              an EPWG Parent Advisory  Council.    Broad goals are:  to foster a positive
              climate of "women to women"  to sustain the young women's interest, curiosity
              and achievement in  order that they might pursue viable careers in SEM; to
              utilize a  multi-disciplinary approach that integrates science, math and 
              technology; to affect curriculum development and enhancement, as  well as
              teacher-training; to harness community, industry, school  district and
              University interest to successfully intervene with  young women to present a
              model for dissemination through journals,  associations, a video presentation
              and other publicity.  ***
