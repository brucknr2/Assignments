Abstract    :
              9450842  Glover                                                    This project
              will to enable underrepresented minority  (Afro-American) students to develop
              the skills in using modern  technology which they will need if they are to
              enter and contribute  to the mainstream of research efforts in the U.S.A. 
              Students will gain hands-on experience in using digitized video as  a research
              technique for studying a wide variety of physical  systems; increase student
              interest in physics by using digitized  video to broaden the range of systems
              which can be studied in the  physics laboratory; and increase student
              understanding of physics  by enabling them to make measurements with greater
              precision and  detail than is possible using just meter sticks and stop clocks.
