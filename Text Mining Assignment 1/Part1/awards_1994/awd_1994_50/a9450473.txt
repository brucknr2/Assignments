Abstract    :
                  This research includes a study of two enzymes, the  redoxyendonuclease and
              formamidopyrimidine/8-oxyguanine-DNA  glycosylase, which initiate the repair of
              oxidative base damages in  the DNA.  The levels of both enzymes will be
              quantified by  biochemical assays in extracts of rat kidney tissue subjected to
               physiological oxidant stress as compared to the undamaged kidney  tissue from
              the same animal as well as untreated controls.  The  results of these studies
              will lead to a better understanding of the  induction of DNA repair activities
              in response to oxidative DNA  damage and provide a basis for future studies on
              the fundamental  mechanisms underlying free radical-mediated damage in animal 
              tissues.    Interactive activities include: teaching a revised graduate level 
              pharmacology course with emphasis on molecular biology principles  and
              techniques; organizing a panel discussion focusing on the  differences in which
              men and women conduct science; and offering a  recombinant DNA technology short
              course to undergraduate and  graduate students as well as interested faculty.
