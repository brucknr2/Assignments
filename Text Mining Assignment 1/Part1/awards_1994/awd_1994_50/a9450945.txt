Abstract    :
              9450945  Bezoari  The project will enhance undergraduate science courses by 
              providing students with hands-on experiences in spectroscopic  analysis on the
              microscale level. The plan centers on the  acquisition of a Fourier Transform
              Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer  with computer data handling and library search
              capabilities. The  primary use of the instrument will be in the Organic
              Chemistry,  Instrumental Analysis, and Physical Chemistry laboratory courses. 
              Students will gain important experiences by: a) applying  theoretical
              principles to contemporary problems Including ground-  water, soil, and air
              pollution monitoring, and analysis of  commercial goods such as solvents and
              food-packaging (polymers  and additives); b) learning techniques of sample
              preparation; c)  using the computer to enhance sensitivity and analyze data
              with  multiple scans, spectral overlay, and quantitative methods; d)  carrying
              out searching and matching of spectra with the library  data bank; and e)
              seeing the internal hardware arrangements used  in the FTIR spectrometer. The
              project is meaningful because  students need to experience how compounds are
              analyzed and  detected on the microscale level with modern instrumentation. 
              Furthermore, these experiences will provide the foundation to  promote a better
              understanding of other modern spectroscopic  methods of analysis (e.g.,
              FT-NMR).
