Abstract    :
              9450512  Brunkhorst    The American Geological Institute (AGI) proposes to
              coordinate the  development of earth science curriculum and student learning 
              materials for grades 7-12.  In Planning Earth Science Education in  the
              Community -- Understanding Our Environment, AGI will build on  the strength of
              very successful earth science education projects,  the AGI Earth Science
              Curriculum Project materials and Earth  Science Content Guidelines Grades K-12,
              as well as major science  education curriculum and reform programs such as
              AAAS' Project  2061.    EarthComm will provide a complete educational program
              in the earth  sciences that includes learning materials, teacher resources
              (both  materials and teacher networks), and assessment tools for a hands-  on,
              student inquiry-based, instructional program that is  interdisciplinary and
              allows implementation in a modular format.   The proposed project will also
              target the development of a strong  mentor program to enhance the science
              teaching capabilities and  leadership skills of teachers.
