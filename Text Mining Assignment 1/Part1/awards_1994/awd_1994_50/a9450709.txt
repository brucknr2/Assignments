Abstract    :
              9450709     Nakhleh  The faculty in the Department of Chemistry propose to
              assemble  a model of change in both the undergraduate chemistry  curriculum and
              instructional strategies.  The faculty also  propose to fully evaluate the
              learning that occurs as a result  of these changes.  The model envisions an
              outwardly spiralling  approach to innovative changes in the full undergraduate 
              chemistry program.  The model starts with a pilot program of  innovative
              changes in the two-semester introductory course for  chemistry majors (60-70
              students per semester), spirals out to  changes in the introductory sequences 
              for science/engineering  majors and agriculture/health majors (3900 students
              per  semester), and finally spirals out to the upper division  chemistry
              courses (2500 students per semester), including the  courses which train
              chemistry teaching majors.  The model  creates a thematic approach to the
              curriculum so that students  will understand how the major themes of chemistry
              interrelate  and how major concepts in chemistry, such as acid and bases, 
              relate to major themes, such as equilibrium.  In order to  emphasize these
              themes and concepts the model prunes the  curriculum and selects topics which
              are fundamental to a sound  understanding of the discipline.  The model also
              weaves the  real world of chemistry into the courses by appropriate  examples
              and introduces organic and biochemistry in appropriate  topics, such as
              equilibrium, thermodynamics, and complex ion  chemistry.  In terms of
              instructional strategies, the model  seeks to implement cooperative learning,
              conceptual change  teaching, a balanced presentation of the macroscopic and 
              microscopic worlds of chemistry, and a balanced development of  conceptual
              understanding and skill in problem solving and using  algorithms in the real
              world environment of large lecture  sections and multiple laboratory sections
              at the university  level.  ***y
