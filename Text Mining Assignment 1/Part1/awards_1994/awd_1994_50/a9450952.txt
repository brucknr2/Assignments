Abstract    :
              9450952  Garcia  This project proposes the development of a course to train 
              undergraduate students in thru-hole technology and surface-mount  technology.
              This course would be made available to students from  four programs of study
              including Electronic Technology, Electronic  Servicing Technology, Biomedical
              Equipment Technology and  Instrumentation Technology. New trends in electronic
              soldering,  assembly, rework, and repair have brought about a revolution of 
              soldering techniques. Basic hand skill soldering techniques of the  past are
              being replaced in industry by sophisticated High  Reliability Interconnection
              Technologies. These changes have  resulted in the need for students to become
              familiar with new  equipment, learn new procedures, and become competent in new
               soldering techniques in order to be a marketable employee.  Very  few
              undergraduate institutions are teaching new soldering  techniques. Most
              industries are sending their employees to  speaialized learning centers where
              they can master tasks required  to be certified in thru-hole soldering and
              surface-mount  technology. This project is unique in that it not only proposes 
              curriculum for thru-hole soldering and surface-mount technology, it  also
              includes an arrangement where students can gain certification  in these areas
              of specialization upon successful completion of the  course.
