Abstract    :
              9450077  Matute-Bianchi    This project, Science and Mathematics Equity (SAME),
              involves activities to develop  a culture that promotes high achievement in
              mathematics and science for girls,  particularly Latinos.  All activities are
              conducted in English and in Spanish.  The  participants will be involved in a
              series of collaborative problem solving activities  focused on integrated
              mathematics and science.  Gender Equity Consortiums (GEC)  will form the focus
              for gender equity development and dissemination activities with  four main
              components:  (1) a 3 week Lego/Logo summer institute which will involve  girls
              and their teachers in collaborative problem solving in a new domain.  (2) girls
               will return to their schools to become peer mentors to other students and to
              receive  mentoring from university undergraduates  (3) teachers will
              participate in a staff  development program focused on gender equity, and (4)
              family members will  participate in a workshop designed to help them support
              the young women in  mathematics and science achievement.  A
              Mathematics/Science/Technology Equity  Team (MSTEAT) will integrate gender
              equity activities into the county and university  subject matter projects in
              mathematics and science.  Finally, the project will  disseminate the model
              through an interactive video disk and public access TV  program.  ***
