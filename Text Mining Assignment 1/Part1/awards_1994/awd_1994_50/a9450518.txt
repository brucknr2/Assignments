Abstract    :
              9450518  Bright    This is a five-year project to prepare five regional service
              teams  in North Carolina to provide teacher enhancement in Cognitively  Guided
              Instruction principles and techniques in K-3 mathematics in  schools throughout
              the state.  The five teams, a total of 30  teachers and 10 mathematics
              educators, will receive 52 days of  training in CGI, leadership skills.  In
              years 3-5, they will  provide teacher enhancement programs, averaging 11 days,
              to about  130 teachers annually and awareness programs to an equal amount in 
              requesting districts.  It is expected that the teams will continue  this
              enhancement at the request of additional schools after the NSF  support ends. 
              The enhancement program used with teachers will be  developed by the project
              leaders in conjunction with the teams.   Formative evaluation of the program
              and team effectiveness.   Summative evaluation will document changes in project
              teacher's  knowledge about CGI and beliefs about mathematics, and changes in 
              their students' mathematical knowledge.  A monograph on the program  and
              suggestions for future CHI inservice will be produced.
