Abstract    :
              9450731  Harvey                                                                 
                   This project is building on previous research and curriculum  development
              work to develop flexible understandings of topics in  precalculus, calculus,
              and linear algebra.  Exemplary course  materials will be produced using a
              modular approach to package the  concepts and activities.  Based on the broad
              mathematical themes,  these materials will make use of constructivist
              pedagogies,  involving cooperative learning, computer technology, and 
              alternatives to traditional lecturing.  Field testing of the  curriculum will
              provide sites for research into the way students  learn the topics and
              environments for teacher enhancement.
