Abstract    :
              9450742  Borrelli                                                               
                   The aim of this project is to design a syllabus, and modules to  support
              that syllabus, which adds computing and mathematical  modeling as essential
              components for the introductory ordinary  differential equations (ODE) course.
              Many modules are be  self-contained units whose main focus is a topic involving
              the  construction and analysis of a mathematical model using a  computer-based
              approach. Some modules are designed to shed new  light on traditional topics
              found in introductory ODE courses. The  material is being produced and
              field-tested by a Consortium of  seven institutions and is being made available
              to the authors of  the next generation of textbooks on differential equations.
              The  overall administration of this project is at Harvey Mudd College,  but the
              work will be done at all seven Consortium institutions:  Cornell University,
              Harvey Mudd College (CA), Rensselaer  Polytechnic Institute, St. Olaf College
              (MN), Washington State  University, Stetson University, and West Valley College
              (CA).  Building on the network and experience accumulated during a  previous
              DUE grant on faculty enhancement, the Consortium is  broadening the scope of
              its newsletter C ODE E to publish  information about the new ODE course
              syllabus and modules before,  during and after test-runs.  In addition, C ODE E
              is disseminating  information about other ODE projects around the country. A
              textbook  publisher is adding additional support for workshops, computing 
              programming expertise, and evaluation.
