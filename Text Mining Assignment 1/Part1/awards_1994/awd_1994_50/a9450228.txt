Abstract    :
              9450228  DeRose    The preparation that students receive in kindergarten through
               twelfth grade and college is no longer adequate to sustain our  nation's
              superiority in mathematics, science and technology.  A  major educational
              reform is essential.  The NCTM Curriculum and  Evaluation Standards provide
              excellent direction for changes in  mathematics education, and inspired the
              development of this real-  world problem-solving high school mathematics
              courseware.  With  this courseware, teachers can base their instruction on real
              world  problems to be solved using mathematics, and provide their students 
              with the power of computing technology to do so.  The courseware  consists of
              1) a set of 60 simulated real-world problems that  require practical solutions;
              2) a set of 15 mathematical,  measurement, and data collection computing
              utilities; and 3) a  teacher guide.  Students are invited to explore problems, 
              implement problem-solving strategies, apply the appropriate  mathematical
              concepts, select and apply the computer utilities they  think are appropriate,
              and determine whether or not the problems  have been adequately solved.  This
              courseware is available in  CD-ROM based multimedia, as well as video tape and
              stand-alone  computer software.  ***
