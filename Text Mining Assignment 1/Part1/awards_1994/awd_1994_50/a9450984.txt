Abstract    :
              9450984  Thompson                                                  The project
              will purchase an FT-NMR for use in a unifying theme of  Molecular Structure:
              Theory, Synthesis, Characterization. This  approach involves cooperative
              planning among the faculty in  chemistry to ensure a sequentially significant
              laboratory  experience with extensive student use of instrumentation and 
              computers as the essential molecular probes.  The instrument, along  with our
              FT-IR, and GC-MS, and computers for molecular modeling are  the foundation of
              this project. Hands-on data acquisition and  interpretation experiments in NMR
              will be developed for all the  laboratory courses beginning with general
              chemistry. In upper level  courses and undergraduate research, students will be
              exposed to the  utility of FT-NMR as a tool for probing molecular structure and
               dynamics. This contemporary approach to laboratory design and  teaching,
              beginning at an early point in the curriculum, is  expected to attract, inform
              and educate the following audience:  prospective students; enrolled students in
              the sciences; students  in chemistry, biology and physics as well as chemistry;
              regional  high school science teachers; chemistry faculty from other liberal 
              arts colleges.
