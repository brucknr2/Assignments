Abstract    :
              9450760  McKnight                                                               
               Reformed calculus materials developed by Ostebee and Zorn at St.  Olaf College
              are being used in the teaching of first year calculus  at The University of
              Oklahoma.  Faculty in the Department of  Mathematics are extending this model
              of calculus reform by  undertaking tasks representing adaption, assessment,
              faculty and  graduate student development, components for pre-service teachers,
               and dissemination.  The St. Olaf first-year calculus model is being  adapted
              and extended to fit a large, comprehensive university  setting including the
              range of difficulties implied by this (large  lecture with recitation,
              GTA-taught classes, honors classes in an  open-admission university, etc.). 
              The project includes the development of a model for GTA training  along with
              supporting materials and training videotapes, a model  for faculty development,
              including materials, suitable for  sustaining such a calculus program, and
              careful assessment of  student performance.  Reports on assessment and
              evaluation will be  useful to other comprehensive universities seeking similar
              reforms.   An important component addresses pre-service secondary mathematics 
              students: adaptation of the GTA training materials for prospective  mathematics
              teachers; training experiments involving pre-service  students; participation
              in GTA training sessions; and, observations  both in university classes and in
              a local high school which has  adopted the St. Olaf's model for calculus.  
              Dissemination plans include packaging materials for dissemination,  production
              of written materials, and visits and locally held  workshops.  At least one
              monograph will be prepared for  publication.
