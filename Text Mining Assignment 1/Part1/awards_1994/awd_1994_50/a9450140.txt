Abstract    :
              The research project constructs a two-country optimizing model to  study the
              intertemporal constraints which fixed exchange rates  impose on fiscal policy. 
              These constraints are identified, and  empirical tests are proposed.  The
              timing of exchange rate collapse  is investigated.  The viability of a fixed
              rate system is shown to  depend on speculators' expectations regarding the
              intertemporal  fiscal constraint.  The vulnerability of the fixed rate system
              to  speculative attack is dependent on the assumptions about capital  mobility.
               The timing of exchange rate collapse under alternative  assumptions about
              impediments to capital flows will be  investigated.    Interactive activities
              include teaching a course in International  Economics and conducting a seminar
              series with visiting speakers in  the same field.  Additional activities
              include presenting a  research workshop, participating in ongoing workshops,
              counseling  students on their research, attending a faculty meetings, and 
              organizing brown bag lunches for graduates and undergraduates  featuring
              outside speakers.
