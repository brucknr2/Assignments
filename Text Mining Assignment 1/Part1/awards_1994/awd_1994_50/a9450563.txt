Abstract    :
              9450563  Brandt  The Cincinnati Public Schools propose an innovative initiative,
               designed to promote broad-based reform in the mathematics,  science, and
              technology education of its students. Restructured  schools, a differentiated
              staffing model, a changed learning  environment, curricular adaptation based
              upon national standards,  and a strong professional emphasis emphasis are all
              components of  the Cincinnati Urban Systemic Initiative's (CUSI) plan for 
              systemic change. The CUSI builds on solid and extensive prior  work in the
              reconfiguration of the schools and implementation of  other major changes,
              including the replacement of top-down  management with a Total Quality
              Management approach to school-  based management, the creation of a pilot
              mini-district which is  envisioned as a catalyst for educational reform and the
              use of  Chapter I funds to bring about systemic reform.  Innovative  approaches
              to mathematics, science and technology (MST) education  reform include: (1) the
              changing of the school calendar in pilot  schools to a year round schedule that
              provides opportunity for  more flexible and creative learning opportunities
              tailored to the  needs of individual children; and (2) the creation of multi- 
              age/grade classroom structures in which the same team of  educators and support
              persons stays with individual children for  multiple years and is responsible,
              with the child, for each  child's successful attainment of outcome-based
              performance goals.
