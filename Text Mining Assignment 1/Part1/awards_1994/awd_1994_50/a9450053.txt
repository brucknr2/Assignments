Abstract    :
              9450053  Ginorio    The project, Rural High School Girls and Science, addresses
              the  needs of rural high school girls with special attention to ethnic 
              minorities.  It uses a system-wide approach, targeting not only  girls
              interested in science, but also their teachers, counselors,  and parents.  The
              project serves sixteen rural schools throughout  the state of Washington. In
              each school, with the support of the  principal, four girls entering the 10th
              grade, three  science teachers, and one counselor will be involved in an 
              intensive summer experience and a year of follow-up activities.   The girls
              will attend a two-week residential camp; the  teachers, a one-week institute;
              and counselors, a three day  workshop.  As part of the follow-up there will be
              school-generated  activities for other students and parents.  Each
              participating  school will receive a set of the curricular materials developed 
              during the summer programs and a grant for special science  projects.  In the
              last year of the project, a state-wide conference  will bring together
              participating students, teachers, and  counselors to share curricular materials
              and begin a public  education effort.  The selection of schools in clusters
              will  magnify and maintain the effects of this intervention beyond the  project
              funded period.  Materials generated by the project will  enable
              non-participating schools to duplicate many parts of the  project.  ***
