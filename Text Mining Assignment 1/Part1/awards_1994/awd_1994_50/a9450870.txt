Abstract    :
              9450870  Potter                                                   This
              Schenectady County Community College project involves the  computerization of
              the general chemistry laboratory, so that  experiments can be done using
              computer interfaced instruments and  a spreadsheet for data acquisition and
              control (LIMSport).  A  complete revision of the experiments currently done in
              the general  chemistry laboratory program underway and includes the development
               of several new experiments expected to be of interest to others.   The project
              is designed to:  (1) Increase the number of student  applications using
              instruments interfaced with microcomputers; (2)  Improve student achievement in
              performance of quantitative  experiments; (3) to result in improved
              computational and computer  skills exhibited by students.
