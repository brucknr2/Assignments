Abstract    :
              Dr. Rachel J. Dewey will spend two years at Princeton University  collaborating
              with Professor Joseph H. Taylor and other members the  Physics Department on
              studies of radio pulsars.  The major focus of  Dr. Dewey's work is a pulsar
              astrometry project which uses Very  Long Baseline Interferometry to make high
              precision meausrements of  pulsar positions, proper motions, and parallaxes. 
              Such  measurements are relevant to many fields of astronomy and physics.   By
              providing direct measurements of pulsar velocities and  distances, they yield
              improved determinations of pulsar birthrates,  ages, and magnetic fields.  In
              addition, astronmetric measurements  yield ties between the extragalactic and
              planetary ephemeris  reference frames and improve the effectiveness of pulsars
              as probes  of the interstellar medium and of relativistic gravity.   
              Interactive activities include:  organizing a brown-bag seminar  series on
              topics of interest to women in physics and closely  related fields;
              superivising junior and senior independent work;  teaching an introductory
              physics course; working with other  astrophysicists to develop a "Techniques of
              Astrophysics" graduate  seminar; and participating in the Faculty Fellows
              program at  Princeton's undergraduate colleges.
