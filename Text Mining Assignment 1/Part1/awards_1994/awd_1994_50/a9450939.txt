Abstract    :
              Students will be introduced via laboratory course work to textile  testing and
              product analysis. Testing is extremely important in the  textile industry from
              fibers through to finished garments to ensure  that quality and performance is
              maintained. Because students could  possibly be employed in a number of
              different areas of the retail  or textile industries, knowledge of how a
              particular product  eventually becomes available to consumers is highly
              desirable.  Throught the use of a tensile tester, students will be introduced 
              to the myriad of different types of tensile testing that fibers,  yarns,
              fabrics, components, and garments may undergo. In addition,  students will be
              able to evaluate the effects of routine finishes  normally applied to textile
              substrates (i.e. dyeing, scouring,  bleaching, shrink proofing, mercerizing,
              etc.). Also students can  be introduced to the phenomena of photo degradation
              and the  deleterious effects it has on certain textile substrates through 
              chemical and physical analysis of the substrates' properties.
