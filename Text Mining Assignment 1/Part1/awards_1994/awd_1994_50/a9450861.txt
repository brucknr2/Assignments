Abstract    :
              9450861  Strommen  Under this project a concerted effort to integrate Raman and 
              Resonance Raman spectroscopy into the undergraduate curriculum  beginning with
              Organic Chemistry and proceeding through upper  division laboratories in
              analytical, inorganic, and physical  chemistry is being undertaken.  The
              experimental sequence has been  formulated to both highlight the uses of Raman
              spectroscopy and to  show its complimentarity to standard IR information. The 
              experiments demonstrate the ability of Raman spectroscopy to probe 
              low-frequency modes, obtain quantitative information on mixtures, 
              differentiate between structural isomers and obtain values for  fundamental
              physical constants of molecules.
