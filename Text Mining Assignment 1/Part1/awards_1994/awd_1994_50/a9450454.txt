Abstract    :
              9450454  The proposed research would study the various physical processes 
              determining the plasma configurations of the Neptunian and  Uranian
              magnetospheres. The proposed project is based on the  Voyager observations and
              would include (1) Guiding center motion  of charged particles and plasma bulk
              properties along a field  line in the magnetospheres with a magnetic fields
              represented by  both the OTD and SH models (2) Theoretical model of the 
              plasmaspheres of Uranus and Neptune (3) Dynamics, especially  current systems
              and their effects in the Uranian and Neptunian  magnetospheres (4) Sources and
              transport processes of the plasmas  of the Uranian and Neptunian
              magnetospheres.
