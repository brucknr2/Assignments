Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to provide information regarding  the small
              sample properties of several recently proposed  methodologies for estimating
              marginal model mean parameters.  Focus  will be on the generalized estimating
              equation methodology (Liang  and Zeger, 1986, Zhao and Prentice, 1990, Prentice
              and Zhao, 1991)  and a likelihood approach to estimation in this setting 
              (Fitzmaurice and Laird, 1993).  These models are applicable when a  sample of
              clusters of correlated observations is collected, as in  a longitudinal study. 
              The critical need for such methods is when  the correlated response measures
              are discrete or cannot be modelled  with a multivariate normal distribution,
              and there are both time-  varying and time-stationary continuous covariates. 
              The impact of  missing data on the small sample properties will also be
              assessed.   Large-scale computer simulations will be used to address these 
              questions, with attention paid to computational concerns and  required
              resources.    The interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate-level 
              course to statistics students; participating in a graduate-level  course on
              longitudinal data; organizing a series of mini-courses on  topics related to
              this research; seminars; informal groups; and  visiting local area statistical
              organizations with students.
