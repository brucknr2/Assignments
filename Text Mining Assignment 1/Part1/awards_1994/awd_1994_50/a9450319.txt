Abstract    :
              9450319  Wyche    Brown University proposes to expand its Summer Research-Early 
              Identification Program (SR-EIP) in the biomedical sciences to a  year-round
              research and career oriented experience for highly  motivated Brown
              underrepresented minority students in the life  sciences and engineering.  The
              program, Research Careers for  Minority Scholars (RCMS) at Brown University,
              will involve talented  students from the freshman through senior year and
              expand the  career options for those students during the four-year period of 
              the proposal.  Students will be matched with faculty sponsors who  will provide
              mentorship, guidance, and a first-rate research  environment starting in the
              freshman year.  During the summer  following the freshman year, students will
              participated in a nine-  week program comprising a continuation of the research
              experience,  seminars and field trips, weekly research colloquia by Brown 
              faculty and outside speakers, and visits to industrial companies.   During the
              junior and senior year, students will be encouraged to  apply to Brown's Ph.D.
              programs and to other highly selected  graduate schools.  One measure of the
              RCMS experience's success at  Brown will be the number of recruits to graduate
              degree programs.   The program's goal will be to produce a minimum of 15
              pre-doctoral  candidates by the year 2000.
