Abstract    :
              9450876  Vanasupa                        This project focusses on enhancing
              materials engineering education  at Cal Poly in the area of advanced materials
              synthesis and  processing. With the funds provided by this grant, we will
              purchase  a sputtering system and an ellipsometer to complete the 
              instrumentation required for a microelectronics processing lab. 
              Microelectronics processing is an ideal setting for learning the  relationship
              between materials processing and the resulting  properties: the materials used,
              like silicon, have properties that  are highly sensitive to processing
              conditions, clearly  demonstrating the link between the processing conditions
              and the  material properties. Microelectronics processing also exposes the 
              materials engineering student to a spectrum of engineering  materials,
              involving polymers, ceramics and metals.
