              (AAC),  NSF will sponsor a one-day symposium, "Discovery and  Connection: New
              Pathways into Science anf Mathematics."  The  symposium is scheduled for
              January 23, 1994, immediately  following the AAC 1994 annual meeting.  The
              symposium is open  to all, but is expected to attract about 150 participante
              from  among those attending the AAC annual meeting.  The presenters  for the
              symposium have been identified by NSF from among its  grant holders.  The
              topics will be: Learning science as science  is done: the new hands-on
              pedagogies; Establishing new  priorities in science and mathematics education;
              Challenging  the prevailing culture: developing institutional support for  new
              approaches to science and mathematics education.  ***
