Abstract    :
              9450066  Zakaluk    The New York City Public Schools has a $50,000 planning
              grant to  create a five-year teacher enhancement proposal that could reach  the
              850 middle school mathematics teachers in the City's 182 middle  level schools.
               The planning grant allows the establishment of a  Design Team to build a
              15-month teacher enhancement program, two  six-week summer sessions plus
              follow-up activities in the year  between the summers using instructional
              modules from nationally  recognized innovative programs.  The planning grant
              will start  after January 1, 1994 for 12-months with the main task of a major 
              teacher enhancement proposal to the National Science Foundation by  October 1,
              1994.
