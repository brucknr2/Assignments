Abstract    :
              9450934  Nyerges  New pedagogy indicates that undergraduate education in
              geography,  including geographic information systems (GIS) education, should 
              foster group-based active learning and individual critical  thinking, while at
              the same time treat substantive topics of  geographical concern. A GIS provides
              an effective means for  capturing, managing, analyzing and displaying large,
              complex  geographical data sets for various applications. This project, 
              therefore, enhances the character of undergraduate GIS laboratory  experience
              through the use of team work and geographic-based  critical thinking skills for
              undergraduates in geography GIS  courses. One introductory course, two
              intermediate and one advanced  are emphasized. Implementation of this new
              pedagogy is accomplished  by integrating commercially available GIS and group
              support system  (GSS) software running on workstations linked by a local area 
              network server. ArcView and Arc/Info GIS software also supports two  levels of
              capabilities across a three-course sequence.
