Abstract    :
              9455379  Galanter  Undergraduate science education has two jobs. First it must
              prepare  young scientists to continue their studies in one of the  disciplines.
              But even more important, science education has a  responsibility to the nation
              and its citizens to ensure scientific  literacy among the electorate. If we
              regard all introductory  students as recruits for advanced work as a major, we
              may fail to  provide subject matter appropriate to the non-scientist. 
              Alternatively, if the non major is a central obligation, we may not  attend to
              the needs of the advanced instruction. We propose an  alternative-a
              constructivist introductory program that lets  students study quantitative and
              experimental aspects of human  nature from the biological to the social at
              varying depths and  breath. The program provides the infrastructure for a core 
              curriculum in science. This new educational design consists of  transportable
              but interdependent modules that require careful  reading and analysis,
              occasionally of primary sources. There are  also many opportunities for a
              variety of complementary projects,  field trips, computerized experiments and
              simulations, and summer  studies in research laboratories, that will let
              students extend  their science skills.  Student participation in the collection
              and  analysis of data and concepts are central to this proposal, thus 
              departing significantly from audio-visual and electronic  augmentation of
              classical lecture methods. These separable, but  cross-integrated units can be
              adapted to a variety of teaching  contexts. We will demonstrate this
              portability by using them at  neighboring institutions during or immediately
              following this  grant.
