Abstract    :
              Mathematics faculty at Wentworth have been employing active  learning strategies
              characteristic of the calculus reform movement  at all levels of mathematics
              courses for students of engineering  technology since 1989. This student
              population is motivated  primarily by perceived relevance of subject matter to
              specific  technical problems. They are developing, through joint efforts of 
              mathematics and technical faculty, laboratory investigations using  engineering
              laboratories and multi-media simulations which  illustrate and teach
              mathematical concepts.  This planning project  begins at the intermediate
              algebra/trigonometry level and continues  through differential equations, and
              includes the finite  mathematics/statistics track for manufacturing students.
              100  sections per year, containing 2500 students, will be affected.   Through
              the Southeast Massachusetts TECH PREP Consortium, Wentworth  is taking the lead
              in extending the secondary level "integrated  curriculum" reforms of Tech Prep
              to the college level. Tech Prep  consists of alliances of secondary and post
              secondary schools in a  (2+2) format for technical education.  The Wentworth
              project is  serving as a national model for colleges of engineering technology 
              in integrating the learning of mathematics with technical  applications.
