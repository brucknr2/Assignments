Abstract    :
              9455693  Leber  The fundamental tenet of this project is that student interest 
              in  science will be aroused and their understanding of the scientific  method
              enhanced by the introduction of multi week bidisciplinary  laboratory modules
              at the end of each semester in the introductory  chemistry sequences general
              and organic chemistry. The laboratory  modules are organized around themes that
              have broad-based  relevance: water analyses due to environmental concerns,
              plants  assays in response to environmental matters and biochemistry  interest,
              and drug design in recognition of the large pre-medical  student population
              among the students enrolled in the introductory  chemistry courses. The
              laboratory modules are designed to imitate  aspects of research by allowing
              students latitude in formulating  specific goals for the project, by
              incorporating a longitudinal  component to the study for establishment of a
              qualitative and  quantitative database, and by forging research teams both
              within  the individual teaching laboratories and also by bridging students 
              groups in related science disciplines.
