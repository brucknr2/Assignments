              Physics Laboratory Course       An Innovative Introductory Physics Laboratory
              Course at  Rutgers-Newark is designed to improve the understanding and 
              appreciation of the laws of physics, and of the instrumentation and  methods of
              modern physics and technology. The course which uses  transducers interfaced to
              microcomputers will be further developed  and expanded during the period of the
              present proposal, and the  results adapted for and shared with a diverse
              population of high  school teachers and their students and 2 year college
              faculty and  students. The makeup of the Rutgers-Newark student body and the 
              geography and demographics of the Newark area, coupled with  significant
              outreach efforts, ensures a large minority student  participation in this
              project. Teaching and learning strategies  geared to the needs of a diverse
              urban student population will be  developed. These strategies will utilize non
              intimidating but  rigorous discovery based and goal oriented experiments and
              will  provide a meaningful and accurate introduction to the excitement  and
              creativity of scientific discovery and analysis. The course  will develop and
              use modern sensors for motion, force, temperature,  sound and electromagnetic
              field measurements. The sensors are  interfaced to microcomputers, allowing the
              students to acquire data  and analyze their measurements rapidly in order to
              explore  alternative physical hypotheses. The project will attract more 
              students into physics and engineering, and will produce better  educated
              students with critical analytical skills in all majors.
