Abstract    :
              Four six-day workshops for 20 undergraduate general chemistry  teachers each,
              will introduce participants to the LIMSport program,  a cost-effective
              implementation of computer data acquisition and  reduction in the laboratory.
              LIMSport allows direct data  acquisition into a spreadsheet. Since standard
              hardware and  software (Lotus 1-2-3) are used, both the program and the 
              individual student experiments are easily shared. Faculty will have  hands-on
              experience with interfacing and an opportunity to adapt  laboratory experiments
              to the LIMSport format.
