Abstract    :
              This project builds on the previously granted NSF collaborative  computer
              calculus project. It will further enhance the student  experience by: (1)
              Adding physics and chemistry projects throughout  the calculus sequence, and
              into precalculus, and differential  equations; (2) Adding computer science
              projects to the discrete  mathematics and pre-calculus courses; (3) Using the
              portfolio product  mode in the physics, chemistry and computer science courses.
              The use  of portfolios as an assessment tool will produce a product of national
               importance.    The interplay in this project between mathematics and the
              sciences --  physics, chemistry, and computer science -- will create an
              educational  environment that emphasizes the interconnection of scientific 
              knowledge in order to prepare students more effectively for the  future.
              Students will be introduced to state-of-the-art technology  including CD-ROM,
              and the creation of three dimensional animations of  functions using MAPLE or
              similar software. An end product of this  project will be a faculty manual,
              Portfolios Across Scientific  Disciplines.
