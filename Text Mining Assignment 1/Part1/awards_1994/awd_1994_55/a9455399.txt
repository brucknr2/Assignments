                                   Engineering    Title: Enhancing the Environmental Content
              of Undergraduate  Engineering Curricula     The overall objective of this
              program is to introduce environmental  issues into the curriculum of each
              traditional engineering  discipline at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU),
              focusing on the  freshman and sophomore years.  This will enable each student
              to  gain exposure to environmental concerns and problem-solving methods  in
              their discipline.  Environmental units that can fit easily into  several
              existing required cmurses will be developed.  This will  form the basis for
              subsequent efforts focused on junior and  senior-level courses as a follow-on
              to the current project.   Throughout this effort, course materials that can be
              widely  disseminated to other U.S. engineering colleges and universities  will
              be developed.    The approach outlined in this proposal is favored over the 
              development of new or required environmental courses for several  reasons.  One
              is that modern engineering curricula already have a  surfeit of competing
              demands for new or specialized courses. Thus,  as a practical matter, it is
              difficult to introduce new  requirements into the curriculum at most
              institutions.  More  importantly, however, environmental issues should not be
              seen as  distinct from "mainstream" engineering issues.  By integrating 
              environmental considerations into basic engineering courses in each 
              discipline, all engineering students will come to see that  environmental
              factors are an inherent part of good engineering  practice.  Relatively small
              modifications in the curricula of  existing core courses can have a significant
              impact on the  environmental education of all engineers,  not just those who
              choose  to specialize in environmental engineering.
