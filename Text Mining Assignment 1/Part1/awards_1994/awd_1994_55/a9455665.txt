Abstract    :
              9455665  Lawrence  This two component proposal will improve geoscience teaching
              at the  freshman and sophomore levels, particularly for non-science  oriented
              students. We propose to complete a study of concepts and  misconceptions
              brought to our course by entering students using  surveys and interviews. Our
              investigations have discovered some  unexpected, "pre-science" misconceptions.
              Students with the least  prior contact with science are likely not to accept or
              effectively  use fundamental assumptions held throughout science like the 
              universality of the most basic laws in time and space. The second  component
              will use the results of this study to guide the creation  of computer-assisted
              teaching modules, initially one on coastal  processes and one on mountain
              building. These modules will be  interactive multimedia programs which promote
              participant learning.  We plan to construct "virtual" field trips, animated
              simulations of  processes, and interactive mathematical effects. We will
              address  recognized conceptual problems directly, particularly through 
              repetitive interactivity. Branching lines of study will be  triggered to fill
              in remedial background for those who need it.  Authorware Professional is the
              intended programming tool for the  highest level multimedia interactions. Our
              efforts will be  evaluated by repeating the survey approach. If possible, we
              will  include this in the modules. The teaching modules will form the  basis
              for publishable CD multimedia programs.
