Abstract    :
              Two groups of eighteen college astronomy faculty will come to the  Center for
              Astrophics (CfA) in June 1995.  Each group will  participate in a week-long
              workshop that will include daily  lectures and training sessions and nighttime
              observing.  While at  the Center, faculty will be taught the rudiments of CCD
              (charged  coupled device) operation, techniques of image reduction and 
              photometric measurement, image processing techniques and data  reduction.  In
              addition to CCD photometry, photoelectric photometry  will also be covered for
              observing occultations, and for people who  wish to use photoelectric
              photometers.  The participants will be  given information on hardware and
              software available for small  telescopes, and will get experience in using that
              equipment at the  telescopes at the CfA's Oak Ridge Observatory.  They will
              interact  with faculty who have conducted successful research programs at 
              other small colleges, and with scientists who have programs that  utilize data
              taken with small telescopes.  They will learn about  on-line resources for
              research.  And they will discuss how to fund  their work, write grant
              proposals, and report their work in  journals.  Participant time will generally
              be evenly divided  between lectures (during morning and early afternoon
              session) and  application (at evening observing sessions).  The participants
              will  also be encouraged to develop one short set of instructional  materials
              or outline a student project based on their research  interest.  The format has
              evolved from previous workshops.
