Abstract    :
               This project's strategy is to use the power of advanced  workstation technology
              to improve the way science is taught and  learned in a multicultural
              university. Project activities will  have four faculty persons from biology,
              chemistry and the earth  sciences collaborating to develop three new
              interdisciplinary  courses, write 29 interactive science visualization
              courseware  applications, revise instructional delivery, prepare a variety of 
              instructional materials that can be used at other institutions,  integrate
              Internet resources into the classroom, and create a new  class of instructional
              applications that can be executed remotely  over the Internet using the
              World-Wide-Web protocol. This project  will annually involve about 200 students
              who are science majors  and 500 general education students. The goals are to
              increase  retention of majors and the scientific literacy of non-majors. 
              Courses will be offered in a highly visual, user-friendly,  computer-based
              learning environment that is interactive, powerful  and intuitive. Language
              barriers are less of a problem in an  interactive environment utilizing
              pictures, animations, sounds,  graphs, words and numbers where science can be
              seen, heard and  explored. More fully engaging students in thinking and problem
               solving will allow them to learn better. Also, techniques,  concepts and
              demonstrations which are too expensive, dangerous or  do not lend themselves to
              traditional modes of instruction can be  taught despite pedagogical obstacles.
              Project results will be  disseminated through publication, professional
              presentations, and  be made available nationally over the Internet.
