Abstract    :
              9455163  This three-year project will extend an existing calculus  coalition to
              create a network of two year colleges and  comprehensive universities that will
              reform their calculus  curricula. The existing coalition in southeastern Texas
              will  expand in three stages to include institutions throughout the  South
              Central states. The extended coalition will grow from  intensive nine-day
              institutes and will be fostered by mentoring,  electronic mail, follow-through
              workshops, and a newsletter.    The coalition will use the materials and
              methods of the Calculus  for Comprehensive Universities and Two-Year Colleges
              (CUTYC)  Project, in which two-person faculty teams at Sam Houston State 
              University and North Harris, San Jacinto Central, and Tomball  Colleges have
              written student activities and customized  instructional methods from other
              calculus reform efforts. CUTYC  integrates cooperative learning, graphing
              technology, and writing  in a progression of problems and projects that
              challenge students  while improving their confidence and study skills.    The
              CUTYC faculty teams will serve as the senior personnel for  SC3. At each
              institute they will lead eight new teams who will  experience the CUTYC
              approach and plan for the ensuing year. The  CUTYC teams will mentor the new
              teams as they craft a curriculum  suited to the needs of their students and
              home institutions. The  new teams will conduct workshops for their colleagues
              to spread  the ideas and methods of the project to other faculty and other 
              courses. The coalition will directly involve 56 faculty leaders  at 28
              collaborating institutions. The project will influence  numerous other faculty
              through on-site workshops, conference  presentations, and publications.    An
              advisory board will guide the project's progress, and the  project will employ
              an instructional consultant and an evaluator.  Evaluation will be used to
              refine the instructional approach, to  customize it to local site conditions,
              and to measure the success  of the project.
