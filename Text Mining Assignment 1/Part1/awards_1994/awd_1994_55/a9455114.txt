Abstract    :
              This project continues a series of week long workshops for  teachers of
              calculus. Common features of workshops in this  sweries: review the concerns
              that gave rise to the calculus  reform movement; summarize the common themes
              that characterize  the thinking of those who lead the reform movement; enable 
              participants to get a comprehensive overview of the materials,  developed in
              many different projects, now available for their  consideration; are led by
              people who have had hands on experience  in the developing of a particular
              project, and are willing to  share what they have learned about student and
              colleague reaction  without pushing their particular materials; and help
              participants  to plan a level of involvement appropriate to their own 
              situation.
