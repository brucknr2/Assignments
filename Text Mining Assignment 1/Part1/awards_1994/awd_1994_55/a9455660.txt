Abstract    :
              9455660  Naumann                                               Computer
              programming is often taught primarily by example, and  there is widespread
              interest in more systematic methods, especially  mathematically rigorous
              "formal methods". There are now  undergraduate level textbooks and teaching
              materials for beginning  programming courses using the method called program
              derivation,  whereby correct programs are derived from their specifications by 
              calculation. The objective is to develop lecture notes and  programming
              assignments for an undergraduate data structures course  based on program
              derivation. The materials are based on those now  being used in the classroom,
              and will be evaluated by educators at  other universities for content and
              suitability for use in  undergraduate courses in data structures. By meeting
              the need for  instructional material based on the extensive research literature
               on program derivation, this project directly benefits educators who  wish to
              teach scientifically based systematic methods of  programming. By providing
              material on par with textbooks for the  more traditional approach, this project
              helps to provide a basis  for meaningful comparison between curricula based on
              formal methods  and other curricula.
