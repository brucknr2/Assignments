Abstract    :
              9455954  DeTurck                                  A consortium of six
              institutions: the University of Pennsylvania,  Villanova University,
              Polytechnic University, Community College of  Philadelphia, University City
              High School and the Society for  Industrial and Applied Mathematics, are
              planning to undertake a  major initiative to integrate research and real-world
              applications  into the basic mathematics curriculum, and to integrate advanced 
              mathematics better into the upper-level curricula of disciplines  which use it.
              Efforts are focused upon: development of basic and  advanced interdisciplinary
              courses which are oriented to specific  applications areas or goals;
              development of applications and  laboratory-oriented courses for mathematics
              majors; use of  Calculus-reform pedagogy and methods in more advanced
              mathematics  and other disciplinary courses; creation of applications modules 
              for mathematics courses; and, creation of mathematics modules for 
              other-disciplinary courses.  During the course of this planning  grant, work
              will be initiated on planning for new courses and  materials, continuing work
              already begun; and the production of one  or two finished modules.
