Abstract    :
              Networked Financial Simulation Using LambdaMOO Technology   Given recent
              advances in network and MUD (Multi-User Domain)  technology, it is now possible
              to build a networked simulation of  the international financial system
              containing within it several  simulated national financial systems. We propose
              to build that  simulation, and to call it Money MOO.  Few current financial or 
              economic simulations illustrate interactions inside the financial  system as a
              whole. Fewer still combine national and international  financial systems to
              illustrate their interconnectedness. Although  the economic system itself is
              dependent on interactions among  individuals and institutions, currently
              available simulations do  not typically base their outcomes on that reality.
              Instead, most  existing financial simulation software is designed to be used by
              an  individual student working in isolation, not cooperating or  interacting
              with other students.  Our proposed simulation, Money  MOO, will have the
              following characteristics:  a. The simulation will be interactive and its
              outcomes will depend       on the combined decisions of the student-players. 
              b. The simulation will be made freely available to all educational      
              institutions through the Internet.  c. The simulation will be fun to play. It
              will be a version of the       most popular networked interactive game format
              which exists,       the Internet MUD.  This networked simulation tool will
              permit courses such as  Introductory Macroeconomics, Money and Banking, and
              Financial  Institutions and Markets to be taught much more effectively than 
              they can be if the only available tools are textbooks and  single-user
              simulations.
