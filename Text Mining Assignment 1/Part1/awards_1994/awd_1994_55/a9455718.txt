Abstract    :
              A curricular innovation is being implemented that involves the  introductory and
              intermediate courses offered during the first  two years in the chemistry
              curriculum.  There are three critical  components to this project: l) to
              integrate both inorganic and  organic chemistry throughout the first two years
              of introductory  and intermediate chemistry; 2) to fashion a laboratory
              sequence  that promotes student understanding of the qualitative and 
              multidisciplinary aspects of chemistry, including the use of  modern
              instrumentation at the introductory level; and, 3) to  create lecture and
              laboratory texts for use with such  innovations.  A unique advantage of this
              sequence, absent in the  "traditional," "organic first," and "two cycle"
              approaches, is  the overall matching of topic development to student ability
              over  the two-year sequence.  This approach builds from an empirical  basis
              those unifying concepts of chemistry throughout a two-year  sequence.  By
              removing the barrier separating organic from  inorganic, both major and
              non-major chemistry students will be  exposed to a more integrated view of
              chemistry, and will have  fundamental concepts reinforced with the widest
              possible variety  of chemical examples.
