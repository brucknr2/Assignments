Abstract    :
              9455719  Hadlock                              Through the sponsorship of the
              Mathematical Sciences Department,  Bentley College has recently developed a new
              interdisciplinary  course entitled "Modeling Applications in Environmental 
              Management." This course serves a wide range of students and has a  dual
              objective: to teach them about the complex range of everyday  environmental
              issues that are faced by business and governmental  organizations, and to give
              the students first hand experience in  the key role that mathematical modeling
              plays in dealing with these  issues. The course has a significant field
              component that includes  visits to operating companies and government
              installations.   The purpose of this grant application is to develop textbook 
              materials and teaching guidance that would enable a wide range of  teachers
              primarily at the college level, but also at the high  school level, to
              incorporate some or all of the same material in  offerings at their own
              institutions. The course developer has spent  many years in industry applying
              mathematical models to  environmental problems and is in a unique position to
              develop and  organize such materials for use in the classroom.   In fact, this
              course has already attracted considerable attention  outside the College, and
              many invitations have been received to  speak about the course itself and to
              provide further material that  might make it possible for others to teach this
              subject matter.  Thus the purpose of this proposal is to provide support for
              the  development of high quality materials to support the inclusion of  this
              material in courses at various levels and at various kinds of  institutions, to
              train a pilot group of teachers in its use, and to  initiate and promote the
              further dissemination process through the  academic community.
