Abstract    :
              This project enables undergraduate students to generate  high-quality color
              geologic maps in a newly developed stand alone  "hypermedia" programming format
              (SuperCard) that links ancillary  data with these maps, termed "dynamic digital
              maps".  The dynamic  digital map "templates" will enable any geologist to
              insert maps,  figures, photographs, and data, and should benefit the entire 
              geologic community.  These templates will offer an entirely new  medium for the
              publication and distribution of high-quality color  geologic maps in the
              computer environment, including all ancillary  data (for example, chemistry or
              structural data), linked to these  maps in an easily accessible format. 
              Because all data can be saved  from the program to tab-delimited ASCII format
              files, the data are  easily accessible and accurately transferable to other
              workers.   Also, because of the digital format, a wealth of data can be 
              included, all of which can be easily distributed by Internet, on  diskettes, or
              CD-ROM.  Students learning the techniques needed to  do this will benefit
              greatly in making desktop computers a more  productive tool for solving
              geologic problems; in addition they  become more employable by having these
              skills.
