Abstract    :
              Faculty at the University of Oklahoma are producing,  evaluating, and
              disseminating an interdisciplinary  mathematics course for students whose major
              does not require  calculus.  Many of the ideas from calculus such as rates of 
              change are included.  The goals are to provide students with  an appreciation
              of the intrinsic worth of mathematics,  expose them to real applications of
              mathematics, and empower  them with the quantitative and qualitative skills
              necessary  for analytical and mathematical reasoning.  The course is  not to be
              a broad survey of either mathematics or its  applications; rather, it focuses
              on a few significant and  timely applications of mathematics provided by
              professions  from agriculture, biology, business, chemistry, engineering, 
              music, physics, political science, and zoology.  A key  feature of the course
              is the implementation of modern  technology to provide students with
              fundamental tools such  as graphical analysis, which have broad application and
               allow a diminished role for traditional drill and  calculation.  One produce
              of the project will be a  commercially published text.
