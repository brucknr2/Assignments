Abstract    :
              The visualization of complicated three dimensional Inorganic,  Bioinorganic, and
              Solid State chemical structures is a particularly  difficult problem for
              students to overcome when the primary means  of communication is the two
              dimensional world of text books,  blackboards, and overhead projector screens. 
              Due to the increased  performance and availability of personal computers, both 
              instructors and students are beginning to embrace interactive  multimedia as a
              means of communicating chemical information.  The  goal of this project is to
              provide on CD-ROM a wide variety of  manipulatable molecular models, miniature
              movies, and dynamic  animations that address the topics in Inorganic and
              Bioinorganic  chemistry that will most benefit from a multimedia format.  The 
              free software Chem3D Viewer is being used to present a database of  hundreds of
              accurate crystal structures that will benefit students  and teachers at all
              levels who encounter inorganic structures.   Stand alone tutorials that
              describe the use of the software and  explain difficult structural concepts of
              inorganic chemistry are  being produced.  Dissemination of test versions will
              be via the  Internet, followed by the complete version on CD-ROM, and evaluated
               by polling users at a variety of small and large institutions.
