Abstract    :
              Every area of modern biology relies on quantitative concepts but  the
              quantitative training of life science students is rarely  connected to biology
              and many biology students fail to appreciate  its relevance. The goal of this
              project is to create a unified  curriculum which develops the students'
              quantitative approaches  to problems in the life sciences. This project will
              couple an  introductory statistics course with a general biology laboratory 
              course at the University and develop teaching units for the  middle school
              level. The key to the long term benefits and  widespread significance of this
              project is that a teaching circle  will be formed which is interdisciplinary
              and includes middle  school teachers. This collaborative team will be united by
               commitment to teach science and mathematics from an integrated, 
              project-based, problem-solving approach. It brings together  education and
              subject matter experts. Locally, this project will  revise the manner in which
              biology and mathematics are being  taught at the University of Portland and
              Portsmouth Middle  School. It will impact future teachers through
              student-teacher  placements and through the University's teaching methods
              courses  in the School of Education. Because flexible teaching modules  which
              couple statistics and general biology and teaching units  for middle schools
              will be developed, field tested, evaluated,  and disseminated, the outcomes
              from this project will contribute  to systemic reform of science/mathematics
              education at the  national level.
