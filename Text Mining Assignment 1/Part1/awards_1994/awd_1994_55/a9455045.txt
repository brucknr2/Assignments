Abstract    :
              Wireless information networks are taking an expanding role in the  world's
              telecommunication infrastructure and interest in wireless  communications is
              growing faster than ever.  It is important for  schools of electrical
              engineering and computer engineering to  prepare their students for careers in
              this important discipline.    This project offers a short course suitable for
              electrical  engineering undergraduate faculty interested in developing a 
              wireless Communication Systems Laboratory at their home  institution.  Twelve
              faculty will be instructed through a series of  lectures, discussion,
              experimental work, and one computer  simulation in various topics essential to
              developing a wireless  communications laboratory and sample projects.    This
              project builds upon a laboratory developed via an  Instrumentation and
              Laboratory Improvement grant.
