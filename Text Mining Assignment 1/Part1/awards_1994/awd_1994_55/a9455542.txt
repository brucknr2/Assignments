Abstract    :
              This project takes advantage of recent developments in multimedia  computer
              technology to create an integrated set of computer-aided  learning (CAL)
              modules to teach fundamental concepts of geology in  general education courses.
               The software consists of  graphics-intensive, interactive multimedia modules
              that will  include animation, video, sound, and hypertext linking across 
              topics.  Module topics include global geology, plate tectonics,  geologic time,
              Earth interior, Earth materials, global cycles,  human influences, and
              evolution of the Earth.  Questions throughout  the material provide immediate
              feedback to the students and guide  their progress.  Quizzes after each section
              assess concept  attainment and provide automated scoring for assessment of
              student  progress and effectiveness of the instructional media.  The new 
              modules build on the success of an award-winning pilot module  developed by the
              PI, and are guided by student evaluations  collected throughout the development
              and assessment phases.  The  initial target audience will be students in two
              large general  education courses for non-science majors (>60%
              freshmen-sophomores,  ~10% education majors) taught by the PI (History of Life)
              and the  Co-PI (Planet Earth).  The modules have broad applicability to any 
              introductory geology general education course, and will be  published, widely
              advertised, and disseminated nationally to  universities, colleges, junior
              colleges, and high schools.   Extensive use of the modules in the preparation
              of elementary and  secondary teachers is planned.
