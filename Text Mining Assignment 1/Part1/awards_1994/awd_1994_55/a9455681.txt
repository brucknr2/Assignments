Abstract    :
              9455681  Kharas  This project will develop a model comprehensive organic
              laboratory  curriculum that will give students the opportunity to be 
              imaginative and creative, lead to better understanding of the  concepts that
              underlie scientific research, and show an important  connection between
              theoretical and practical organic chemistry. We  will design individual
              exploratory research projects for the last  quarter of a three-quarter
              laboratory course that will integrate  the instructor's research interests with
              learning experiences for  the students.  The vehicle will be individual organic
              and polymer  syntheses that combine classic organic chemistry and polymer 
              chemistry.  We will also continue our efforts at improving and  assessing the
              value of this curriculum in ways that inform the  development of the course and
              guide research on the learning  outcomes.
