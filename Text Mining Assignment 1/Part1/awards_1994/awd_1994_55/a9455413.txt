Abstract    :
              9455413  Mushinsky                            A new, integrated course in
              natural sciences will be developed for  non-science majors. This course will be
              the cornerstone for a  two-tier, interdisciplinary curriculum in the natural
              sciences.   The proposed course, "Fundamentals of Natural Science" (FNS), 
              differs from traditional science offerings in both content and  delivery. FNS
              will be designed to build a foundation for scientific  literacy, develop habits
              of mind consonant with critical thinking,  and give students the sense of
              discovery and accomplishment that  comes from "doing science." Because
              contemporary students have a  keen interest in their environment, examples from
              the natural  environment will be selected to illustrate the basic concepts of 
              science under consideration. The examples will be explored in a set  of
              learning exercises designed specifically to promote active  inquiry and
              cooperative learning. These exercises will be developed  by faculty and
              teaching assistants with guidance from the USF  Center for Teaching
              Enhancement. A textbook and exercise manual  will be developed. The faculty in
              the project are a biologist,  chemist, geologist, physicist, and an educational
              psychologist.
