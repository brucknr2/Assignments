Abstract    :
              From August 1991 to April 1993, CIRCE (the Center for  Instructional Research
              and Curriculum Evaluation at the  University of Illinois) executed a contract
              with the National  Science Foundation under the title "Teacher Preparation
              Archives:  Case studies of NSF-funded Middle School Mathematics and Science 
              Teacher Preparation Projects."   The funding of the nine campuses  to develop
              exemplary programs for middle school teacher  preparation was a singular effort
              on the part of the Foundation.  This unique program highlighted both middle
              school education and  teacher preparation in a way never done before. The
              circumstances  of funding as well as the development and obstacles to campus 
              reprogramming are reported in detail in the final report. Several  interpretive
              chapters were also included.    That project culminated in a report entitled
              "Teacher Preparation  Archives: Studies of NSF-Funded Middle School Science and
               Mathematics Teacher Preparation Projects" by Robert Stake, James  Raths, Mark
              St. John, Deborah Trumbull, David Jenness, Michele  Foster, Sherry Sullivan,
              Terry Denny and Jack Easley. Targeted  both for a general and specialist
              teacher educator audience, the  report runs over 300 pages as a paperback book.
               An additional  1200 copies are being printed for distribution to anyone who 
              requests and is advertised through mathematics, science, and  middle school
              education organizations.
