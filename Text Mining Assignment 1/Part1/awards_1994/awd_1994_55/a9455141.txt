Abstract    :
              There is now a substantial (though still inadequate) body of cases  that can be
              used in the teaching of engineering ethics. Virtually  none of the cases,
              however, have a numerical component. This  project includes a workshop to
              develop numerical problems to  accompany existing cases and newly developed
              cases in engineering  ethics. The development of numerical problems promotes
              the  introduction of issues in engineering professionalism and ethics  into
              required undergraduate engineering courses in several ways:          * It
              provides an added inducement to engineering instructors,  who are always
              looking for new problems, to use the cases.        * It appeals to students,
              because it provides a human and  social dimension to their technical work.     
                * It mitigates the objection of instructors that there is  insufficient time
              to introduce sections on professionalism and  ethics, since there is a directly
              relevant numerical component in  the cases themselves.        * It helps to
              integrate ethics components into technical  courses, since the ethics
              components are more clearly linked to the  technical work.        * It could
              provide a model that is more compelling than  free-standing ethics cases for
              introducing ethics sections into  engineering textbooks.      A workshop
              develops such numerical problems; and their classroom  use is evaluated a year
              later.
