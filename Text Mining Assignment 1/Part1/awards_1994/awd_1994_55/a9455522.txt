Abstract    :
              9455522  Feinstein                                             A cognitive based
              approach is used to develop comprehensive  materials for the first courses in
              Computer Science based on  Implementation D of Computing Curricula 1991. The
              distinguishing  features are: (1) materials based on a strategic sequencing and
              the  associated level of mastery of key topics, (2) a topical coverage 
              carefully based on a spiral approach to information presentation,  (3) an
              integral use of structured labs as a necessary component,  (4) an emphasis on
              frequent feedback to facilitate learning and  evaluate the effectiveness of
              instruction, (5) remediation  materials for students requiring additional
              assistance to meet the  required levels of mastery ,(6) an early use of teams,
              (7) a  student surveying tool used to track all students to provide  outcome
              assessment, and (8) review and evaluation by multiple  institutions for
              iterative material refinement and national  dissemination. The project will be
              carefully evaluated by a team of  eight consultants with expertise in the
              fields of computing,  computing education and educational psychology. The
              materials  developed will also be critiqued by professionals at a wide variety 
              of other institutions for their input as to the applicability of  the materials
              to students at their institutions. The resulting  materials will be made
              available in hard copy and through  electronic media.
