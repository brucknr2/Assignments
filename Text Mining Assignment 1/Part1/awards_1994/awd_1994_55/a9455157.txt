Abstract    :
              This project involves developing modern physical chemistry  laboratory
              experiments during a three week faculty workshop for 16  participants.  Each
              participant will be asked to present to the  workshop an outstanding experiment
              from their home institution,  provision having been made in advance for the
              material needs and  apparatus.  Participants will then develop in pairs two new
               experiments with write-ups for use in their home institutions,  which will be
              presented to and tested by the whole group.  It is  expected that experiments
              involving modern instrumentation (e.g.  lasers and computers), easily
              transportable experiments,  experiments involving biochemical materials, and
              fast kinetics will  be developed.  These new laboratory exercises will be field
              tested  during the following academic year by at least four of the 
              participants'institutions, and presented at a symposium organized  by the
              project director at a national ACS meeting.  Commercial  publication of the
              products will also be explored.
