Abstract    :
              9455470  Thomas  Precision Teaching of an Introductory Physics E & M Course for 
              Engineers  The program focusses on techniques for improving student 
              performance in an introductory (Physics) Electricity and  Magnetism course
              undertaken as a requirement by pre-Engineering  majors. A computer based
              interactive program allows students to  simulate their own homework problems
              and thereby be led through  an effective routine for problem solving. Emphasis
              is on  abstract concepts such as fields and potentials where the  student has
              no basis of practical experience. The simulations  are to be integrated into an
              existing Precision Teaching  routine which is successful in improving student
              performance  (and halving student attrition). Emphasis throughout is on 
              quantitative assessment of outcomes and elimination of  co-lateral variables. 
              Development of the simulation is  under-way. Support is sought for completion
              of the development,  for integration into the Precision Teaching routine and
              for the  assessment of performance change. The assessment program  includes
              comparisons between test and control groups,  implementation in courses
              covering 2,000 students per year and  transfer to another institution. Faculty
              response will be  monitored through surveys, student response assessed also 
              through surveys and student performance measured through the  standard
              techniques of tests and quizzes.  The program will  monitor performance of
              almost 6,000 students and track some of  these through the full three years.
              Correlations will be sought  with gender, minority status, performance before
              entering the  class and with performance through the major courses.
