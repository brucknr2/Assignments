Abstract    :
              9455636  Mandelbrot                                           This project is
              building on the inherent interest in fractal  geometry by creating materials
              for a series of 3 fractal-based  undergraduate mathematics courses: an
              introductory pre-calculs  course emphasizing concepts, visualization, and
              interdisciplinary  connections, particularly to art, music, philosophy and
              economics;  a post-calculus course presenting the same material at a deeper 
              mathematical level; and an upper level course on the applications  of fractals
              and chaos including a detailed examination of data  analysis and modeling.  All
              courses will make extensive use of  computers in lecture demonstrations,
              student homework, and  communication and dissemination of course materials. 
              Platform  independent graphics software will be developed to facilitate this 
              program. Detailed instructor lesson plans will be developed and  tested.
