Abstract    :
              Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) will operate a coordinated series of  workshops for
              undergraduate faculty in the sciences and mathematics  during each year 1995
              and 1996.  These workshops on Program that  Work, each involving approximately
              20 three-person institutional  participant teams, will emphasize classroom and
              laboratory  enhancements in undergraduate science and mathematics.      The
              objectives for these PKAL Workshops are 1) to disseminate  information on
              current reform efforts in teaching undergraduate  science and mathematics,
              reforms that have created systemic change  within an institution and as well as
              improved one course; 2) to  encourage regional and national networks of faculty
              concerned with  curriculum reform; 3) to foster a national environment which 
              supports improvements in undergraduate science and mathematics.    The
              Workshops will focus on eight issues:  Revitalizing  Introductory Courses in 1)
              Biology, 2) Chemistry, 3) Mathematics  and 4) Physics; 5) Science as a Liberal
              Art; 6) Interdisciplinary  Programs; 7) The Research-based Curriculum, and 8)
              Programs for  Minority Student Success.  Each issue, to be presented in a
              series  of workshops, will be coordinated by a Workshop Advisory Board and 
              issues Task Forces, individuals selected on the basis of their  leadership in
              PKAL, their involvement with a PKAL Program that  Works, and the recognition of
              their work by the community.
