Abstract    :
              In an innovative approach to teaching the freshman chemistry  laboratory,
              students are being exposed to a variety of chemical  principles in the context
              of biologically-relevant chemistry.  Large numbers of students taking freshman
              chemistry (upwards of  60%) are pursuing careers in the biological sciences
              and/or  medicine.  These students are being shown the relevance of  chemistry
              in understanding biological systems by engaging them in  authentic scientific
              inquiry.  The program is module-based, where  each module focuses on a specific
              question that the students must  answer about a biologically-relevant problem. 
              Each laboratory  module is designed as an in-depth study lasting three to four 
              weeks.  "A guided-discovery method" of teaching the course is  employed, and
              teamwork and decision-making are emphasized.  Computer pre-labs are used to
              ensure that the students are  confident in what they need to do when they enter
              the laboratory,  and interactive videos help them to grasp difficult concepts. 
              Novel computer based examinations are being developed and tested.  The topics
              of four of the modules include:  1) the chemistry of  the stomach; 2) skin
              cancer; 3) lead poisoning; and 4) blood  chemistry.  The fifth module is
              designed to expose the  undergraduate students to science teaching in the local
              primary  and secondary schools.  Each college student observes and 
              participates in a K-12 science classroom, reads articles in  science education
              journals, works with a science teacher in a  local school, designs and teaches
              a laboratory-based project for  the K-12 classroom, and participates in
              discussions and  evaluations about the science lesson that has been taught and
              the  conclusions that have been reached about the teaching and  learning of
              science.
