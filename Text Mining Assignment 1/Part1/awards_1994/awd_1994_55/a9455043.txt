Abstract    :
              The Center for Applied Aquatic Science and Aquaculture will conduct  a 3-week
              summer project for 20 undergraduate faculty that  demonstrates environmental
              problem-solving as an effective teaching  strategy to stimulate undergraduates'
              interest in environmental  science. Using the theme of Stressed Stream
              Analysis, participating  faculty will learn NEPA-based environmental analysis
              concepts and  techniques and will work in teams to prepare an Environmental 
              Impact Statement for a proposed pollution source in a disturbed  stream
              ecosystem. Concepts and skills participants will learn  include: Habitat
              Evaluation Procedures, using Biotic Indices,  electrophoretic and microscopic
              techniques to evaluate pollutant  effects on organisms, and water quality
              analysis of nutrients and  metals in a stressed stream ecosystem.
