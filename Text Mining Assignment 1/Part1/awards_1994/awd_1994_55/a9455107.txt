Abstract    :
              This project aims to acquaint faculty, general chemistry  coordinators, and lab
              directors with the theory and practice of  cooperative learning in the general
              chemistry laboratory.   Participants are invited from all institutional
              settings including  two-year and four-year public and private colleges and 
              universities.  Cooperative modes of instruction that have proven to  produce
              remarkable improvements in student attitudes toward  chemistry, persistence,
              and success in learning have been developed  at Clemson University.  The method
              uses a new set of laboratory  software, SuperChemLab, for the project-style
              laboratory exercises,  which will be available to participants for their own
              applications.   The workshop assumes that participants will adapt and adopt the
               cooperative learning mode for their own laboratories, and several  features of
              the program including hands-on experience are aimed at  facilitating this
              process.  Instructor's manuals, texts, and  background materials will be
              provided and considered in small  groups during the workshop.
