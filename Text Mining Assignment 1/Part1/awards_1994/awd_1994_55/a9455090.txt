Abstract    :
              A one week workshop on FT-NMR will be held for undergraduate  faculty, who have
              had little experience in FT-NMR, from 2 and 4  year institutions in a six state
              region:  Arkansas, Oklahoma,  Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa.  The
              workshop will consist of  lectures, instrument use, and data analysis and will
              cover topics  ranging from beginning NMR theory to pulse sequences and 2-D NMR.
                Hands-on experience will be gained on a JEOL 270 MHz FT-NMR.  A  workshop
              handbook, containing a large number of spectra, will be  prepared for each
              participant.  Participants will be able to use  these spectra at their home
              institutions. Major goals of the  workshop are to up-date participants on
              modern NMR techniques and  to encourage use of these techniques in the
              undergraduate  curriculum.    Follow-up activities include a meeting at the
              Midwest Regional ACS  meeting, in November, 1995.  Reports prepared by
              participants about  their use of the information gained from this workshop will
              be  collected, edited, assembled, bound and distributed to all  institutions of
              higher education in the six state region.
