Abstract    :
              9455972  Butler                                   This project is designed to
              enrich mathematics courses at all  levels of the curriculum by incorporating
              applications to and  perspectives from economics and chemistry and to enhance
              the  teaching of mathematical methods in economics and chemistry  courses.  In
              the first year of the project, development of  curricular materials are being
              undertaken at Haverford and  Princeton in economics and at the University of
              Chicago in  chemistry.    Development and dissemination of these materials is
              catalyzing  formation of two coalitions, one for mathematics and economics and 
              one for mathematics and chemistry. This project is developing  sample materials
              which can later be expanded into a project for  national impact.  The project
              involves close interdisciplinary  cooperation, participation of graduate and
              undergraduate students,  and team-teaching through faculty Sabbaticals.  In
              particular, a  workbook incorporating sophomore mathematics (multivariable 
              calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations) with its  applications to
              chemistry is being written by interdisciplinary  teams for widespread
              dissemination.
