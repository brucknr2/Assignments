Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for multi-year funding in support of an  integrated and
              expanded instructional program for community college  faculty. The proposal
              will introduce molecular biology and  molecular diagnostics as continuing
              education. The proposed program  will continue to offer the week-long summer
              institute in molecular  biology and  add to that a new summer institute in
              molecular  diagnostics in which the principles of molecular biology find 
              applications in several areas of biotechnology.   In addition, it will expand
              follow-up program services and other  participant contacts with university
              faculty and industry  researchers.  Internships for community college faculty
              will  continue as a part of the program.
