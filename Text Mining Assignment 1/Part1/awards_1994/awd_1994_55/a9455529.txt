Abstract    :
              The project is developing a database containing 1100 highly-linked  hypertext
              questions that provide a computer driven interactive  study guide for
              introductory astronomy for non-majors.  The goal is  to complement traditional
              text and lecture materials with a new  teaching tool designed to improve
              logical thinking by allowing  students to explore and correct natural
              misconceptions.  The  hyperlinked environment enables (1) presentation of
              multiple levels  of information and reasoning; (2) the possibility for deeper 
              exploration by motivated students; and (3) rapid feedback for the  instructor
              and for the students.  The 100 questions will be  selected to span the range of
              material commonly covered in  introductory astronomy.  This teaching tool can
              provide students  with a visually attractive, intellectually stimulating
              alternative  path for learning and honing their logical skills.     The study
              guide will be accessible at any Internet node via access  to the World Wide Web
              using public-domain NCSA Mosaic software on  IBM PC's, MacIntoshes, or Sun
              workstations.  The project is  conducting a controlled test of this
              instructional tool in an  introductory astronomy course.  At the same time it
              is being made  available at all interested sites.  The level of presentation in
               the study guide also makes it accessible to advanced high school  science
              students.
