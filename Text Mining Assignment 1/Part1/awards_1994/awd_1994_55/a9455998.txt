Abstract    :
              9455998  Douglas  A consortium of colleges and universities on Long Island in
              conjunction with the State  University of New York seeks funds to plan a
              comprehensive proposal for the new NSF EHR  initiative, Mathematical Sciences
              and Their Application Throughout the Curriculum. The State  University of New
              York at Stony Brook is the lead member in this consortium which includes 
              public and private, 2-year, 4-year and doctoral institutions. The proposal's
              goals are to: (i)  change the culture among quantitative departments to produce
              cooperation and improved  instruction in mathematical aspects of their
              curriculum; and (ii) create new courses and  curricular materials that
              integrate mathematical sciences instruction with topics from  mathematically
              based disciplines. The change will start in Long Island institutions, then move
               to SUNY-wide implementation (64 institutions), and then be disseminated to
              other institutions  inside and outside New York. The City University of New
              York will also be involved. The  SUNY Central Administration has committed
              $20,000 for a workshop at Stony Brook in fall  1994 to lay the groundwork for
              this initiative in SUNY. SUNY is developing plans to sustain  and
              institutionalize this initiative within SUNY after the end of NSF funding.
