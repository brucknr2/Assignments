Abstract    :
              This 16-day course offers 40 instructors of undergraduate marine  sciences in
              two-year and four-year institutions the opportunity to  update their knowledge
              and skills in a technologically impacted  discipline.  Participants will engage
              in hands-on field exercises  designed to familiarize them with current
              oceanographic research  techniques, many of which are adaptable to laboratory
              or classroom  demonstration at their home institutions.  Participants will work
               with research scientists, college and university professors, and  experts in
              the private sector engaged in state-of-the-art  oceanographic investigations,
              technologies, or teaching.  Specific  aims of the project are to provide at-sea
              experience in  oceanographic data collection and analysis; to conduct field 
              exercises in local marine habitats; to gain exposure to advanced  technologies
              such as satellite imaging; to interact with experts in  marine science
              disciplines; and to develop new instructional  materials and teaching
              techniques. Hands-on field experience in the  areas of biological, physical,
              and geological oceanography will  allow participants to add breadth or depth as
              necessary to their  marine science training. This project is a joint effort of
              the  University of San Diego, a private four-year university, and the 
              Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District, a public two-year  institution.
