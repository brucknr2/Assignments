Abstract    :
              This proposal builds upon a workshop by the same title being run in  1994. It
              proposes three faculty enhancement workshops for  instructors in two and four
              year colleges. Each workshop runs for  six days in June followed by a one day
              "reflection" workshop in  November. The goal of each proposed workshop is to
              provide  instructors in two and four year colleges an exposure to resources 
              available to teach the undergraduate introductory course in  Artificial
              Intelligence and some approaches for their effective  utilization. Major topics
              to be addressed include how to (1) obtain  available resources, (2) integrate
              classroom lectures, with  laboratory sessions and assignments using repository
              materials and  network facilities, (3) adapt and extend the available pedagogic
               material, (4) improve learning and cooperation between instructors  and their
              students, and between students, (5) establish and  maintain cooperative
              arrangements between instructors at different  institutions, (6) assess the
              effectiveness of various pedagogic  methods for using the resources. Each
              workshop builds upon the  Teaching Portfolio produced in the preceding
              workshop. The Teaching  Portfolio, accessible using Mosaic, includes a variety
              of pedagogic  materials (e.g. syllabi, class-plans, exercises, projects, 
              discussion topics) and references to tools, programs, and other  materials
              available on the internet.
