Abstract    :
              9455826  Amend  This grant supports preparation of a proposal for a major
              systemic  curriculum project that will place students at the center of their 
              learning experience, and will encourage both faculty and students  to (1)
              discuss and understand the importance of applied chemistry  in our society; (2)
              participate in activities that encourage  exploration and cooperative learning;
              (3) engage in a greater  diversity of instructional strategies; and (4) exploit
              the role of  new technologies as a means of implementing these approaches to 
              learning.  The curricular materials to be developed will be based  on a
              three-part balance between (1) the factual aspects of  chemistry (content), (2)
              the role of chemistry in our daily lives,  and (3) the process by which
              information is located and discovered,  and by which problems are solved. It is
              the intent of this project  to develop a wide variety of resources which will
              draw students  into all three of the above aspects of chemistry, and from which
               faculty may select material that best serves their own students and  their
              interests and talents.  Proposal development will focus on  (a) content and
              concept sequencing, (b) appropriate use of  technology, (c) educational
              strategies, and (d) a structure for  dissemination, faculty workshops,
              presentations and publications.
