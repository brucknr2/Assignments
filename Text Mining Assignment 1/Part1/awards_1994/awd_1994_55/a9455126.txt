Abstract    :
              The central purpose of this project is to enhance minority  undergraduate
              faculty education in the areas of robotics and  machine vision.  This purpose
              is achieved by conducting an  intensive training workshop on these topics for
              computer science  faculty members selected from historically minority
              universities.    In particular, we propose to conduct an intensive, two-week
              long  training workshop, along with certain follow-up activities, for 15 
              computer science faculty members selected from minority  institutions. 
              Workshop participants are exposed to up-to-date  topics in computer vision and
              robotics.  The activities  include  direct interaction by Robotics Research
              Laboratory's faculty and  extensive use of the RRL's research equipment.  Also,
              participants  are encouraged to take part in individual and group research 
              projects based on current RRL research efforts.    The final day of the
              workshop includes a brainstorming discussion  of how the information learned in
              the workshop will be transferred  into their curriculum.  The results of the
              workshop will be  published in a refereed journal.
