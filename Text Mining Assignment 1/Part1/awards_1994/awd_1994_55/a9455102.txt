Abstract    :
              A 3.5 day summer workshop in molecular modeling for 12 college  faculty in New
              England and eastern New York will be conducted. No  prior knowledge of
              molecular modeling is assumed and assistance  will be provided to participants
              in establishing a molecular  modeling program at their home institutions.
              Participants will be  introduced to molecular mechanics, semi-empirical
              computation and  ab initio methods, with the emphasis on how to use these
              techniques  to teach undergraduate chemistry. The strengths and limitations of 
              each method will be discussed and participants will have hands-on  experience
              with a variety of software packages. In addition, a  symposium for workshop
              participants and local educators will be  held in January 1996 to facilitate
              discussion of experiences with  computational chemistry in undergraduate
              courses.    Participants will reside at the Campus Center and will share lunch 
              and dinner with workshop presenters. The cost of food and lodging  will be
              covered by the workshop budget. Educators from  resource-poor institutions will
              be provided stipend of $150. Women  and minority candidates are encouraged to
              apply.
