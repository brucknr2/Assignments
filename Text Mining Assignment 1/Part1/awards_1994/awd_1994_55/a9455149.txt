Abstract    :
              This project is to engage undergraduate faculty in a set of  activities that
              will prepare them to teach courses or course  modules on ethical and
              professional issues in computing.  Twenty-five undergraduate faculty from a
              diversity of disciplines  and types of institutions are participants. They are
              required to do  pre-workshop assignments; attend a 5-day workshop during the 
              summer, participate in an on-line forum, and attend a two day  follow-up
              meeting in February. The activities are designed to  address pedagogical issues
              as well as subject matter. The subject  matter topics to be covered include
              proprietary rights in computer  software, privacy, responsibility and
              liability, hacking, risk and  reliability, democracy, access, and autonomy, and
              professional  ethics for computer professionals. The project responds to the 
              growing need for faculty trained in this area as the accreditation 
              requirements in computer science and engineering recommend coverage  of
              "social, ethical, and professional issues in computing."
