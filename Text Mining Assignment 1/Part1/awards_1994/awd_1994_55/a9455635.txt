Abstract    :
              Information will be the coin of the realm in the 21st century,  and learning to
              locate, evaluate, utilize, and disseminate it  will be at the very center of
              the University's mandate. In the  past, only some science and engineering
              students needed extensive  high level computing skills. However now, and
              increasingly in the  future, fluency with computational environments will be a 
              decisive factor in both academic and commercial success.        As a sequel to
              our highly successful first course for  non-computer majors, whose development
              was sponsored jointly by  NSF and the Department of Education, we propose to
              develop a  second course which focuses on the acquisition and presentation  of
              data and information. For data acquisition, the course gives  the students high
              level mastery of the internet. For the  presentation of information students
              will master a multimedia  authoring system.         The Internet segment of the
              course focusses on the  following topics:         . What is the Internet and
              what is it not       . Resources available on the Internet for teaching and 
              research in various fields. Where to locate additional  information.         .
              Navigating the Internet via Gopher, Archie, Veronica         . WAIS and WWW.   
                   . email, FTP, Telnet and List servers         . Using USENET, setting up
              news groups and IRC on an  Internet node set up and maintained at the College. 
                       The multimedia segment of the course uses the Toolbook  environment
              from Asymetrix Corp. and focusses on:         . how to construct simple "books"
              with hot keys and  buttons         . how to create multi-page branching books  
                    . how to create motion and animation         . how to design and create
              hypertext systems         . how to design and create interactive multi-media   
                           . how to program sophisticated multimedia  applications within
              Toolbook.
