Abstract    :
              In recognition of the importance of introductory biology courses at  two-year
              and community colleges to the development of scientific  literacy among
              college-educated individuals, BSCS is  conceptualizing, writing, testing, and
              evaluating a set of  innovative curriculum materials for biology students at
              the college  level.  Collaborating in the 36-month project are fifteen
              partners,  including biology faculty at eight community colleges (including 
              several that offer programs in biotechnology and environmental  technology),
              the American Association of Community and Junior  Colleges (AACJC), the
              two-year college section of National  Association of Biology Teachers (NABT),
              the Society for College  Science Teaching (SCST), the American Mathematical
              Association of  Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), the American Institute of
              Biological  Sciences (AIBS), Ward's Natural Science Establishment, Inc., and 
              Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company (college division).  The completed  program
              will offer an integrated and coherent approach to helping  students achieve
              three major goals of biological literacy: 1) to  understand the basic unifying
              principles of biology; 2) to develop  the fundamental skills of critical
              thinking and scientific  reasoning; and 3) to recognize the applications of
              science,  especially relationships among science, technology, and society.  
              The materials that are being developed are of use to future  teachers or
              science at the elementary and secondary levels because  strategies are
              incorporated that encourage students to reflect on  the overall deign of the
              program, the strategies that help them  learn, various teaching techniques, and
              assessment strategies.  The  products of the project will include student
              materials (readings,  activities, and laboratory exercises) that will support
              both  semester- and year-long introductory biology courses and that  emphasize
              hands-on, open-ended inquiry, collaborative learning, and  the relationships
              among science, technology, and society; an  instructor's gui de that will
              provide faculty with extensive  background reading and specific implementation
              support; and a model  for a faculty development workshop that will be designed
              and tested  by the partner faculty and will be supported after the end of the 
              project by revenues realized from sales of the program.
