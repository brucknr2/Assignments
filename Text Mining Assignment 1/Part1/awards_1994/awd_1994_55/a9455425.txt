Abstract    :
              9455425  Bergland                                             Over 600 students
              (mainly non-science majors) take Introductory  Biology at the University of
              Wisconsin-River Falls each year. Many  of these students tend to equate success
              in college with the  ability to memorize facts, and need more exposure to
              critical  thinking skills used by scientific investigators.  Research on 
              gender issues in science education indicates that computer  simulation is a
              particularly effective way to interest more women  in pursuing scientific
              careers.  We are developing highly  interactive experimental simulations based
              on existing  upper-division laboratories in our biotechnology curriculum 
              (Virology, Molecular Biology, and Animal Cell Culture).  These  simulations are
              used by Introductory Biology students to generate  and test their own
              hypotheses while working in small collaborative  groups. Students manipulate
              objects on the computer's screen much  as they would in reality.  For example,
              they can "spin" the dial of  a micro pipette or operate the control panel of a 
              spectrophotometer, DNA thermal cycler, or electron microscope.   Digitized
              video images of students using actual equipment are  incorporated into the
              simulations to make them more realistic.  Undergraduate education majors
              enrolled in a teaching methods class  are involved in the evaluation of the
              simulations which gives them  first-hand experience in evaluating the uses of
              technology in the  classroom.  The editorial staff of BioQUEST  will provide 
              assistance in the dissemination of the simulations.
