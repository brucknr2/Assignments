Abstract    :
              This project, available in 1995, 1996, and 1997, offers a three-  week workshop
              that gives 20 persons each year hands-on experience  aimed at mastery of use of
              modern nuclear magnetic resonance and  mass spectrometry.  It is now widely
              accepted that these two  techniques are so powerful and central to chemistry
              that virtually  all institutions that instruct undergraduates in chemistry have
               acquired this instrumentation or are planning to do so.  Since the  techniques
              are strongly complementary, they are taught in tandem in  this workshop,
              although attendees can emphasize one or the other if  they wish.  Participants
              will attend lectures, work in groups,  conduct experiments, and devise
              exercises.  Eminent scientists and  major vendors of the instrumentation will
              visit the course and  discuss with participants academic and industrial uses of
              the  techniques.  Participants will develop instructional modules for  use at
              their home institutions, and will share them with each other  at the course and
              via E-mail.  The experience will be reinforced  and continued through
              participation in the activities of research  groups and by donation of
              post-workshop instrument time at the host  institution.
