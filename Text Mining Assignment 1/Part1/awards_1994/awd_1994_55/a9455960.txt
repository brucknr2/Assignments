Abstract    :
              9455960  Clemens                                         The University of Utah
              proposes to explore a model for undergraduate mathematics education  which
              brings teacher/researchers into partnerships with teams of "users" of
              mathematics, both  within and outside the university, with the goal of
              increasing mathematical power and an  understanding of the relevance of
              mathematics of students in a wide spectrum of disciplines and  professional
              careers. Building on modern research on student learning, opportunities created
              by  our university's reform of its liberal education curriculum, and a new
              determination to reach out  to other disciplines, the university proposes to
              create nine cross-disciplinary teams. Each will  be charged with developing and
              team teaching an undergraduate mathematics course, or  modifying an existing
              course by the creation of modules or special units. These courses would 
              develop a mathematical theme through problems from the discipline of the
              "outside" members  of the team, from the other sciences, engineering, economics
              or business. Curricula and teaching  styles in these courses will be influenced
              by exposure of the teams to "hands-on" experiences,  the use of small group
              work, and problem oriented learning.
