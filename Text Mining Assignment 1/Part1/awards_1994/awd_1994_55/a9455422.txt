Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to make the social sciences  and humanities more
              meaningful to engineering students,  including women and underrepresented
              minorities. It is  an  effort to reform undergraduate engineering  education by
              offering a unique interdisciplinary and  multi-cultural diversity engineering
              course as part of  the general education curriculum. The course, entitled 
              "Technology and Culture", places specific engineering  designs within the
              social and political context of  race, gender and individuals. The course is
              designed to  give technical students a better understanding of the  cultural,
              historical and political context of their  disciplines. At the same time it
              gives humanities and  social science students a better understanding of the 
              methods and capabilities of science and engineering.    The project promotes
              new interdisciplinary teaching  methods and encourages faculty to experiment
              with  different ways of incorporating multi-cultural  diversity and gender
              issues into their courses. It  enlists the cooperation of faculty, departments
              and  committees across the colleges of engineering and the  liberal arts and
              sciences. It reinforces this  cooperation through a series of faculty
              development  workshops emphasizing cultural sensitivity training and 
              interdisciplinary teaching methods.    The project also serves as a catalyst
              for reform for  the teaching of other courses that integrate  engineering and
              science with disciplines in the  humanities and the social sciences.
