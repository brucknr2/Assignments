Abstract    :
              The MAA is offering a workshop on cooperative learning techniques  for
              mathematics instructors.  The workshop takes place over two  summers and the
              intervening academic year, beginning in summer  1995.  Experienced,
              enthusiastic collegiate-level mathematics  faculty, particularly those from two
              year colleges, who are  interested in cooperative learning techniques for their
              own  classrooms are the target audience.  The goals of the workshop are 
              preparing them to bring cooperative learning into their classrooms  and
              departments, and to serve as regional resources for local  cooperative learning
              projects.  The project will also test the  hypothesis that the proposed setting
              and time frame is an effective  way to aid faculty to develop the skills to
              enable them to  successfully use cooperative learning as a significant teaching
               mode.
