Abstract    :
              Integrated circuits, and the computers they drive, introduced a  new era in
              electronics. Each year faster, more powerful computers  are produced increasing
              the demand for a skilled work force and  an educated public. Increasing an
              awareness about manufacturing  processes in the semiconductor and computer
              industries is an  educational challenge_one which is hindered by the loss of
              visual  imagery due to the inaccessibility of industrial sites to  students,
              educators and the public.    The SILICON RUN two-part series addresses this
              educational  challenge by capturing the rich images of manufacturing on 
              film/video to provide a clear overview of semiconductor and  computer
              manufacturing. SILICON RUN I, produced in 1986, explores  crystal growth, the
              effects of doping, CMOS transistors, and the  design and fabrication of IC
              wafers. The recently completed  SILICON RUN II continues with testing,
              packaging, printed circuit  board and system assembly, and multi-chip module
              technology. The  series is being used for education and training; thousands of 
              students in universities, colleges and technical schools are  viewing these
              films/videos every year.    The many changes in technology since the completion
              of SILICON  RUN I make it necessary to update the first film with the 
              production of SILICON RUN I.2.  The goal of this project is to  re-film the
              industrial manufacturing footage so the series can  continue providing students
              with viable information about today's  manufacturing. Responses from
              recipients' surveys overwhelmingly  show that the series is an asset to
              undergraduate education.
