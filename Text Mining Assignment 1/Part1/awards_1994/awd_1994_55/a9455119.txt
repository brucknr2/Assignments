Abstract    :
              In the past few years, object-oriented technology has become one of  the
              dominant technologies in the computing industry. In a recent  survey, it was
              reported that over 75% of the Fortune 100 companies  have adopted object
              technology to some degree for their computing  needs. This is in response to
              the increasing software maintenance  cost and backlog that is so prevalent in
              the software industry.  Because object-orientation is becoming one of the
              primary means for  problem solving, the need to teach object orientation in 
              undergraduate curriculum is growing.  This project provides two  2-week summer
              workshops for faculty who do not have any formal  training in the area of
              object-orientation. The objectives are to  introduce object-oriented concepts
              and to demonstrate how to  deliver effective courses and units on
              object-orientation. The  major topics addressed in this workshop include (1)
              object-oriented  analysis and design, (2) object-oriented programming, (3) 
              object-oriented databases, (4) integrating object-orientation into  computer
              science/information system curriculum, and (5) teaching  object-orientation to
              undergraduates. The workshop  includes  lectures and laboratory sessions in
              which participants have  hands-on exercises in each of the above main topics.
              Participants  also plan a course or course unit utilizing object-oriented 
              technology at their institutions during the subsequent academic  year. The
              tools used in the workshops include inexpensive or free  software that are
              easily obtainable by most universities and  colleges.
