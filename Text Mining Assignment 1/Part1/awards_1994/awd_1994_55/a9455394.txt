              Instrumentation Skills With Pre- and Post-  lab Computer Simulations    Proper
              use of instruments is integral to the physical and life  sciences, yet many
              students never become confident or even  comfortable operators because of
              limits on laboratory time and  instrument availability. To introduce principles
              and procedures  before laboratory exercises and to reinforce key experimental
              ideas  after laboratories, a series of interactive computer simulations of 
              laboratory devices and accompanying text materials will be  developed. These
              simulations allow students to explore instrument  concepts at their own pace,
              alone or in groups. Using an icon-based  simulation engine/environment which
              embodies a block diagram  approach, realistic and sophisticated simulations
              (with on-line  help, text and graphical output, and animation) can be created
              much  more rapidly than those written in higher-level languages and can  be
              easily tailored to specific courses and audiences.  The  exercises promote
              logical thinking, active learning, and the  formulation and testing of
              hypotheses.
