Abstract    :
              This three-year program sponsored by the California State  University Program
              for Education and Research in Biotechnology  (CSUPERB) promotes updated,
              current instruction in molecular life  sciences and biotechnology at the
              undergraduate level.  The program  offers summer workshops in molecular life
              sciences and  biotechnology for comprehensive university and community college 
              faculty, complementing the current CSUPERB faculty enhancement  program of
              workshops for the inexperienced in molecular biology.   There are a total of
              eight advanced workshops: two each of the HPLC  Workshop (CSU Fullerton), the
              Recombinant DNA and PCR Workshop (San  Diego State University), the Cell
              Culture Workshop (CSU Hayward),  and one each of the Molecular Approaches to
              Immunology Workshop  (CSU Long Beach) and the Nucleic Acid and Protein Sequence
              Computer  Analysis Workshop (San Diego State University).  Follow-up sessions 
              are coordinated with the annual CSUPERB Symposium and Conference  held at the
              Cal-Poly Pomona campus.
