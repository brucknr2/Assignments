Abstract    :
              9455965  Wallace                                  Dartmouth College is planning
              a major curricular effort aimed at  integrating mathematics across the entire
              undergraduate curriculum.  A team of 29 people, most of which are faculty at
              Dartmouth  College, are working together to create ways of simultaneously 
              teaching mathematics and at least one other subject. The team comes  from the
              departments of mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology,  psychology, social
              science, education, music, geology and computer  science, as well as the
              medical and engineering schools. Also  included are a fine artist, a performing
              artist, a writing teacher  and the director of the local science museum.  The
              goal is the  design of a curriculum project which will change completely the
              way  undergraduate mathematics is taught across the curriculum, across  the
              population and across the nation.
