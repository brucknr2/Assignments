Abstract    :
              This workshop is designed to provide undergraduate computer science  faculty
              with material and techniques for introducing the social and  ethical impact of
              computing in their courses.  The primary focus is  on a set of tutorials
              presented by Dr. Judith Perrolle, a  nationally known expert in the field.  To
              provide the participants  with an effective method for introducing the material
              in the  classroom, each tutorial is followed by having the participants  design
              exercises in reinforcing the material in a cooperative  learning context.  The
              participants are oriented to the many  sources--books, periodicals,
              groups--available.  A separate video  component emphasizes the value of video
              in such courses.  The  workshop is scheduled for June 19-23, 1995, on the
              Bradford Campus  of the University of Pittsburgh.  A follow-up session, two
              days  long, where the participants meet to exchange experience and  materials
              on how they have introduced this material in their  courses, will be held in
              June, 1996.
