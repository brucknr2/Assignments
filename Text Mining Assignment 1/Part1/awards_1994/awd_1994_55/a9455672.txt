Abstract    :
              Computer laboratory projects are being introduced in all sections  of  the basic
              multivariable calculus course at the University  of  Michigan  (1500-1700
              students per year). The  computer  is  being  used  as  a  discovery  tool. The
              projects'  main  features  are:  promotion   of   active   learning   and  
              hands-on   experience,  visualization  through  computer graphics,  gradually 
              introduced  Maple  syntax, furtherance of conceptual understanding,  critical 
              thinking, and quantitative reasoning.    Several  activities  are included in
              the project:  to  develop  a  library  of  laboratory projects (long term: each
              project  is  to  culminate  with  a  problem  applied  to  science,  economics 
              or  engineering);  to  develop  and  implement  cooperative  learning 
              techniques in the computer laboratory environment; to develop and  implement 
              motivational material suitable for feedback techniques  in  large lecture
              classes, using a workstation in every classroom  connected to an LCD plate; to
              write TA and instructor manuals and  videotapes,  and  to create an intensive
              TA and Faculty  training  program.    The  composition  of  the  student  body 
              is  very  diverse.  The  materials  are  being  written with the consideration 
              that  some  students  have  no  prior computer experience. Diversity  in  the 
              cooperative groups will strengthen them.
