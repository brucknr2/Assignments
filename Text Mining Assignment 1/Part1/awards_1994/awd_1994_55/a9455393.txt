Abstract    :
              9455393  Hubele  Title: New Engineering Statistics Course With a Virtual 
              Computer Laboratory  A new engineering statistics course with a virtual
              computer  laboratory addresses the problem of offering a computer 
              laboratory-based course in a university with large enrollments  and few
              computer laboratories. The aim of this project is to  design and implement an
              integrated classroom and laboratory  experience for junior-level engineering
              students who can  communicate with fellow classmates and instructors using  
              electronic mail and file transfer software from their residence  or place of
              work. Computer modem access is the only necessary  student hardware.
              Statistical solutions to multi-disciplinary  engineering problems are created
              by student teams using  statistical methods discussed over the university's
              existing  communication network. The statistical laboratory materials  being
              developed by various researchers are integrated into this  virtual laboratory
              setting, thus making all results accessible  to a larger audience. Classroom,
              laboratory and course  assessments comparing this new course to a traditional 
              engineering statistics course  offer educators the opportunity  to evaluate the
              validity of this integrated course for their  technical course offerings.
