Abstract    :
              Transforming Traditional Quantitative Analysis into a Course in  Modern
              Analytical Science.  This curriculum development project transforms traditional
               sophomore quantitative analysis into a course on modern  analytical science. 
              Building on work supported by the NSF, we  are developing a course that
              emulates the working environment  of a modern commercial analytical laboratory.
               The new lab work  reflects a commitment to addressing organic, biological, and
               environmental studies, in place of much of the traditional  emphasis on simple
              inorganic systems. The types of  investigations include: separations science
              (mixture analysis);  multi-element and trace analysis; and combined physical & 
              chemical characterization. Pervading all of this is a  laboratory structure
              based on Federal Good Laboratory Practice  guidelines, where students are
              responsible for calibration,  certification, and documentation. The objectives
              of Phase 2 of  this project, proposed here, are (1) to conduct a realistic 
              experiment in transportability of the re-structured sophomore  quant course;
              and (2) to produce a Laboratory Manual which is  flexible enough to be useful
              even at institutions with limited  resources. We have enlisted the cooperation
              of a small but  diverse group of interested academic institutions to test 
              transportability at their respective campuses. These schools  will also provide
              feedback regarding laboratory revisions to  help accommodate the wide diversity
              of academic resources. We  will initiate Phase 2 with a summer workshop in 1995
              at SJSU  for all participating faculty. This event will be repeated  through
              1997, with a viable Laboratory Manual as the ultimate  product.
