Abstract    :
              9455613  Maloney  This project will develop a one semester physical science
              course  for non-science, especially elementary education, majors. This  course
              represents an important element in IUPF's teacher  preparation sequence.  The
              course will be activity based with  investigations and exercises designed to
              elicit students'  common-sense ideas about the systems and situations,
              challenge  those ideas where they disagree with the scientifically accepted 
              ideas, and help the students construct a new understanding of the  concepts,
              relationships and principles that apply. A limited set of  investigative and
              reasoning processes, e.g., making observations  and inferences, proportional
              reasoning, and drawing, reading and  interpreting graphs, will be emphasized
              and used throughout the  course. In order to get the students to engage in the
              appropriate  reasoning, and to give them sufficient time to undergo conceptual 
              change and construct a scientifically acceptable understanding,  only selected
              concepts, principles, relationships, and topics will  be explored. Several
              concepts and principles, e.g., area, volume,  density, and conservation of
              mass, will be examined because of  their importance in both chemistry and
              physics. In addition two  fundamental topics, motion in a straight line and the
              basics of  compound formation, will be studied to illustrate some of the 
              contrasts between the two disciplines. The course materials will  emphasize
              pattern finding and analysis and will be designed so that  the students have to
              use qualitative means to work the tasks  encountered.
