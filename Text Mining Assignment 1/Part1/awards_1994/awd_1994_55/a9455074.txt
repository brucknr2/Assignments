Abstract    :
              ATLAST 1995/96 is a follow-up to the NSF sponsored ATLAST Project  to Augment
              the Teaching of Linear Algebra through the use of  Software Tools. The purpose
              of ATLAST is to encourage and  facilitate the use of software in the teaching
              of Linear Algebra.  The project seeks to bring about systemic change in the way
              Linear  Algebra is taught. The goal of ATLAST is to make the use of  software
              an integral part of all Linear Algebra courses.    ATLAST 1995/96 is offering
              two basic workshops on the use of  software in teaching Linear Algebra in 1995,
              one basic workshop in  1996, and one advanced workshop in 1996. Workshop
              participants are  learning to use existing Linear Algebra software packages and
              how  to incorporate those packages into their courses. Participants are 
              expected to design their own computing exercises and projects at a  level
              suitable for an undergraduate Linear Algebra class. These  exercises are being
              class tested during the school year following  the workshop and then submitted
              for inclusion in the ATLAST  database.      The best of the ATLAST 1995/96
              exercises are being included in a  second ATLAST Exercise Book which is being
              published by the  Mathematical Association of America. Selected ATLAST
              materials are  included in the Mathematics Archives at the University of 
              Tennessee, Knoxville. These materials can be accessed by the  greater
              mathematics community through the Internet.    ATLAST 1995/96 is also offering
              one advanced workshop for those who  are already experts at developing computer
              exercises for Linear  Algebra. The purpose of this workshop is to develop
              exercises for  the second ATLAST book. Participation in the advanced workshop
              is  by invitation only.
