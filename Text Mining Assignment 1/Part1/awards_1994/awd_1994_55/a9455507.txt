Abstract    :
              9455507   Biermann                             A modern trend in computer
              science education is to include in the  first course a rigorous and broad
              coverage of the field. This is in  contrast to teaching a traditional literacy
              course which emphasizes  software packages, vocabulary, and computers and
              society or to  teaching a standard introduction to programming. The new style 
              course is especially demanding on both students and instructor  because of the
              great complexity of the ideas to be transmitted in  a short time. This project
              continues ongoing work to provide a  major aid to teaching breadth in the first
              course; it will develop  the "This-is-how-a-computer-works" system which
              simulates levels of  processing in an idealized machine. It enables students to
              view and  manipulate the internals of the compiler, machine architecture at 
              the register level, the switching circuits that implement the  machine
              operations. The system is able to function in the  simulation mode for viewing
              computations, the training mode for  instructing a student on what is happening
              at each step, or the  testing mode which will query students at random points
              and score  the quality of their answers. The system is a general tool for 
              teaching at the early college level; it is useful for lecture  demonstrations,
              laboratory exercises, or individual study.
