Abstract    :
              9455324  Karplus  This proposal is to introduce interactive tutorials using 3- 
              dimensional computer graphics to visualize macromolecular structure  and
              function into introductory biochemistry. Specific goals of this  proposal
              include the development of 14 computer graphics tutorials  to be used in the
              introductory auto tutorial biochemistry course,  the publishing of these
              tutorials, and the holding of workshops for  training teaching faculty at other
              universities to use these  tutorials. One difficulty associated with developing
              such an  interactive curriculum for introductory biochemistry is the large 
              class size. For this reason, this auto tutorial biochemistry course  provides
              an excellent forum for curriculum development, because it  has already
              successfully adopted a highly personal and interactive  format. This computer
              graphics based curriculum should have a large  impact on undergraduate
              education, because tremendous numbers of  undergraduates take introductory
              Biochemistry courses each year,  and very few (if any) such courses currently
              have interactive,  three-dimensional, graphics content. This curriculum should
              be  effective both for attracting more students to continue in  biological
              sciences and for preparing the scientific and biomedical  community of tomorrow
              so that they may assimilate and effectively  apply structural information about
              proteins and other biological  molecules.
