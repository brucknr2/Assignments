Abstract    :
              9455606  Wetzel                                               The Mathematical
              Interactive Network Design (MIND) project is a  computer laboratory designed
              for interactive multi-media  instruction in developmental mathematics. Using
              Visual Basic,  multi-media software and object oriented programs are being 
              developed by supervising instructors.  Students are utilizing a  graphical user
              interface and icon driven software to access and  control various instructional
              media. The goal is to immerse the  student in an intensely interactive, but
              easily constructed,  simulated learning environment. This radically new system
              is  meeting each student's unique and specific needs and providing an 
              individualized tutorial session with appropriate, constructive,  instructive,
              and timely feedback. Artificial intelligence  techniques are being applied to
              implement the concept of guides  whose behavior and even personality is being
              made to depend upon  the attributes of the learner. The guide presents a
              combination of  interactive digitized video and audio integrated with graphics
              and  text to provide the students with choices of lecture, drill,  problem
              solving, review and testing as deemed beneficial or  necessary through
              monitoring of the student's progress and relative  success.  The software is
              being used to supplement and enhance, not  replace, coursework.
