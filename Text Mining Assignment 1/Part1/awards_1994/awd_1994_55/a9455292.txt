Abstract    :
                Undergraduate statistics majors and mathematics majors with an  emphasis in
              statistics receive a broad education which includes  training in mathematics,
              applied and theoretical statistics,  computing, communication skills, and
              general education. Much of  this training is done in a piecemeal fashion.
              Students are seldom  required to combine the various skills learned throughout
              the  curriculum. They also seldom gain hands-on experience by  participating in
              real experiments. They graduate with a vast array  of knowledge but are often
              very inexperienced in putting the pieces  together. They are not ready to make
              their greatest possible impact  in the workplace. A pilot of a capstone course,
              which uses real  world problems, is being developed.  The projects studied 
              synthesize the lessons learned throughout the curriculum and  develop students'
              oral and written communication skills to the  level expected of professional
              statisticians. The synthesis will be  achieved by having teams of students
              participate in work on  projects from the industrial/real world arena. They
              will also study  technical writing and oral presentation modules. Students will
               prepare formal written and oral reports. If a report is not of  professional
              quality, the student will be given considerable  feedback and required to
              repeat the report. All students will leave  the course with a firm
              understanding of the communication skills  required of the professional
              statistician.
