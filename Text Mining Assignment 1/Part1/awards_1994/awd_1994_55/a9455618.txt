Abstract    :
              9455618  Herman  Mathematics educators from three quite different institutions
              of  higher learning -Grinnell College, The University of Washington,  and
              Seattle Central Community College -- are jointly developing an  interactive
              linear algebra text. This text is being organized in  clusters of individual
              modules to facilitate its adaptation to many  different curricula. The main
              goals of the project are: 1) to help  students develop their geometric
              intuition about the concepts of  linear algebra; 2) to deepen their
              understanding of the algebraic  formulations of these concepts and strengthen
              their ability to  manipulate them; and 3) to help students gain an appreciation
              of  how the concepts and methods of linear algebra are applied. The  text is
              being constructed using Maple V, enhanced by a  supplementary package with
              superior text-handing and screen-layout  capabilities. The text is being
              designed to support collaborative  learning and writing to learn. Many
              exercises encourage  experimentation and exploration and many will ask for
              written  hypotheses and conclusions. The entire text will be made available 
              through the Mathematics Archives and hence will be readily  available to all by
              ftp, gopher, and MOSAIC. In addition to being  appropriate for all students
              majoring in scientific, engineering,  and mathematics, the textual materials
              are particularly appropriate  for use with students preparing for careers as
              secondary  mathematics teachers and are being tested with preservice teachers 
              at all three institutions.
