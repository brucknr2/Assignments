Abstract    :
              Faculty from two-year colleges across the United States will be  trained on the
              theory, techniques, and laboratory use of state-of-  the-art chemical
              instrumentation in a series of one-week workshops.   For each of two summers,
              11 workshops will be offered:  four on the  East Coast, sponsored by Northern
              Virginia Community College and  George Mason University; four in the Midwest,
              sponsored by Sinclair  Community College and the University of Dayton; and
              three on the  West Coast, sponsored by Shoreline Community College and Western 
              Washington University.  A total of 144 two-year college faculty  will be
              involved as participants.  They will select instruction  from among atomic
              absorption, flame emission, nuclear magnetic  resonance, Fourier-transform
              infrared, ultraviolet/visible diode  array and gas chromatograph/mass
              spectroscopies, vapor phase and  high performance liquid chromatography,
              computerized data  acquisition and treatment, and electrochemical methods.
