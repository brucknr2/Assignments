Abstract    :
              Columbia's Department of Geological Sciences and Barnard's  Department of
              Environmental Science are in the process of  developing a new curriculum in
              Earth and Environmental Science  that builds on the intellectual and
              information resources of  Columbia, Barnard, Teachers College, Lamont-Doherty
              Earth  Observatory and the NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies  (GISS). 
              This two-year project involves design of a  multidisciplinary introductory core
              curriculum, for both geology  and environmental science majors. This three
              semester core,  serving both Barnard and Columbia, focuses on three interacting
               global systems: the lithosphere, the climate system, and the  biosphere. Women
              form a key target audience of this enhanced  curriculum, through merging of the
              Barnard introductory sequence  with that of Columbia    The core incorporates
              new technologies for accessing, analyzing  and transmitting information, thus
              shortening the information  path between research scientist and undergraduate. 
              An electronic  library containing data, text, models, graphics and analytical 
              tools is being developed. Through this electronic library  students can explore
              features of the three systems and processes  that operate within and among
              them. The design team, brought  together from within the Columbia community to
              develop and  implement the curricular revisions, engages a wide variety of 
              scientists and educators in the process.
