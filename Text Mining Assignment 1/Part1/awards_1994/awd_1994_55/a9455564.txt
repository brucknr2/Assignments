Abstract    :
              9455564  Fathe  A team of Occidental faculty members in physics and mathematics
              are  constructing a unified freshman program in physics and calculus. The 
              students in the program are those with some deficiencies in pre-college 
              mathematics and science preparation, but who might be motivated to pursue  a
              science or mathematics program as a background for a variety of  careers,
              including medicine, and K-12 teaching. These students are  disproportionally
              female, Latino, and African-American, groups which have  long been
              under-represented in mathematics and science-based careers.   The students
              enroll in a year-long course consisting of 4 units in the  fall semester and 8
              units in the spring semester. The pace is relaxed to  permit students time to
              consolidate their mathematics skills and develop  physical intuition. In
              addition, the course includes appropriate use of  technology for analysis,
              simulation and calculation, carefully designed  group assignments and projects,
              and frequent writing assignments.  Further, the students are offered the
              opportunity to share a corridor in  a campus residence hall. Employment of
              upper division science students as  teaching assistants and residence hall
              staff helps to integrate college  learning with college life.  By the end of
              the program, the students will  have a solid understanding of how calculus and
              physics develop from a few  fundamental ideas, and how the disciplines are
              interrelated. They will  develop the mastery of basic math, physics, and
              communication skills  necessary to support these intellectual goals. More
              importantly, the  students will develop attitudes and learning styles that will
              support  further study and success in science and mathematics.
