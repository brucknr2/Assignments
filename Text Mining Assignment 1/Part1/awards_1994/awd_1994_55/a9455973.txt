Abstract    :
              9455973  Boyce                                    During the past five years
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has  taken several major steps to modernize
              the content of elementary  courses in mathematics, science, and engineering,
              and to bring  contemporary computing technology into widespread use in the 
              instruction of these courses.  Two specific directions are being  proposed. 
              The first is to enrich the instruction in courses in all  of these areas by
              preparing application modules in science and  engineering for use in
              mathematics courses, and mathematical  modules for use in science and
              engineering courses.  The goal in  both these cases is to forge closer links
              between instruction in  mathematics on the one hand and in engineering and
              science on the  other.  In this way students will see mathematics developed
              more  closely in the context of applications that are of interest to  them. 
              The second major direction of proposed work is to expand as  rapidly as
              possible the use of a mode of instruction known locally  as studio courses.  In
              this type of course all class meetings take  place in the same room, and the
              distinction among lectures,  recitations, and laboratories is essentially
              eliminated.
