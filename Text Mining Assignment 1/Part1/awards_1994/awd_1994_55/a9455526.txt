Abstract    :
              9455526  Cooper                               Most traditional organic chemistry
              laboratories tend to be of the  cookbook type. That is students learn
              laboratory techniques and  then use them to synthesize a given compound in a
              prescribed manner  with a recipe. There is growing unease within the chemical 
              education community about the pedagogical value of such  laboratories. The
              organic laboratory course proposed here will  build on the strengths of our
              general chemistry laboratory courses.  Students will work in groups on open
              ended projects instead of one  lab period exercises. Instead of learning a
              technique as an end in  itself, techniques will be learned as a means to an
              end. Over the  course of the semester, students will apply their problem
              solving  skills to projects approximating the research process as closely as 
              possible. The students will also use both their written and oral  communication
              skills to plan, critique, and evaluate their  experiments.  A number of
              resource materials will be developed including a  multimedia program that
              incorporates video and text so that  students can access information in the
              laboratory, and a laboratory  manual that will contain a database of typical
              experimental  conditions and work-up procedures in addition to descriptions of 
              techniques. This new lab format will have a significant impact on  how our
              students learn organic chemistry and will be particularly  beneficial to women.
               The principal value of this project lies in its application to ALL  organic
              students, in the expected improved performance and higher  retention rates for
              women and in its adaptability to other  situations.
