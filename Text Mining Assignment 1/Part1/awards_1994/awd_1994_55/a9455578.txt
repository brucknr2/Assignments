Abstract    :
              9455578  Palettas                                             A novel laboratory
              approach is being developed for the instruction  of introductory statistics for
              engineers, with emphasis on problem  solving, conceptual understanding, and the
              use of writing and  calculation-and-plotting as acts of cognition. Through 
              interdisciplinary cooperation, a closer link between statistics and 
              engineering courses is being made for a great benefit to both.  Finally, taking
              advantage of the capacities made available by  state-of-the-art computing and
              multimedia technology, curricular  resources are being developed that will
              increase students'  interest, motivation, and excitement.
