                                                           Life Sciences    Title: Cellular
              Biophysics Software    The purpose of this project is to make educational
              software and  methodologies for its use in teaching cellular biophysics widely 
              available.  Software has been used for 10 years to teach cellular  biophysics
              to juniors majoring in engineering and science at MIT.  The software is used in
              lecture demonstrations, special recitation  classes held in electronic
              classrooms, as a basis of homework  assignments, and for more intensive
              research projects defined by  students.  Use of the software has greatly
              enhanced students'  interest in and comprehension of topics in cellular
              biophysics.   All the software has been developed by student programmers and is
               currently available only on UNIX workstations at MIT.  The software  is
              written in C and XWindows.  In the current project  undergraduates and graduate
              students are converting this software  to run under a vendor distributed
              computation and visualization  software package (MAT LAB) which is available on
              all the common  computer platforms including Macintoshes, PCs running Microsoft
               Windows, and UNIX workstations running XWindows.  The conversion  allows
              students and instructors to more readily customize the  software for their own
              use, and greatly facilitates software  maintenance for faculty.  A software
              textbook is being published  and distributed with floppy disks of the software.
               The software  and software textbook will be companions to a new textbook on 
              cellular biophysics that is in preparation.  The combination should  provide a
              new set of educational materials for teaching cellular  biophysics to students
              in engineering and science.  The approach is  to provide rigorous, in-depth
              mathematical treatments as well as  the e mpirical basis of important
              biological, chemical, and physical  principles of cell biophysics.  The
              software together with the  software text allows students and faculty to
              explore these  principles in new ways.
