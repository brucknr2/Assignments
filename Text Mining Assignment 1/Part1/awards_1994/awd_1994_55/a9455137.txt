Abstract    :
              The Computer Science Department at SUNY Geneseo has developed a  "three-fold"
              introduction to computer science, whose central  mission is to give students
              rudimentary but real ability in all  three methods of inquiry. The Department
              is offering a faculty  enhancement workshop for instructors interested in
              adopting this  curriculum. The curriculum contains relatively abstract
              material,  material that is often not what students expect. A number of active 
              learning techniques are essential if students are to master this  material. The
              workshop presents the rationale behind the new  curriculum, and provides
              intensive introductions to using and  developing the kinds of active learning
              materials that have  succeeded at Geneseo. The workshop consists of a primary
              meeting in  June of 1995, and a follow-up meeting in June of 1996. Between 
              these meetings, participants will integrate elements of the  three-fold
              introduction into their own curricula. This workshop  improves participants'
              undergraduate computer science programs  through direct training, evaluation of
              each other's strategies for  adopting the three-fold introduction, and ongoing
              dissemination of  materials (both at the meetings and via Internet).
