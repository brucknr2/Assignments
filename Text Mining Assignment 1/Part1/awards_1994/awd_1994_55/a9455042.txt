Abstract    :
              Two workshops will be held for 20 faculty each in the areas of  Ozone Depletion
              and the Greenhouse Effect. The audiences will be 20  faculty from undergraduate
              institutions and 20 from community  colleges in the Philadelphia vicinity.
              These current topics can be  incorporated into curricula in several science
              departments. The  workshops will provide the participants with hands-on
              experience  with detection equipment used in the field. The participants will 
              also receive in-depth lectures on the science relevant to the two  topics and
              will discuss society's responses to these environmental  challenges through
              legislation and court decisions and the  portrayal of these issues in the mass
              media. One day follow-up  workshops will be conducted for each of the two
              groups, and  evaluations will be done at each workshop.
