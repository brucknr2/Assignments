Abstract    :
              9455985  Gutjahr  New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (New Mexico
              Tech), Navajo Community  College (NCC), San Juan College (SJC) and Sandia
              National Laboratories (SNL) will form a  coalition to develop and implement
              innovative approaches to mathematics education across the  curriculum. An
              advisory board with both academic and industrial representation will guide and 
              critique the programs and other institutions may be used to test the
              approaches. Faculty from  mathematics, physics, geoscience, biology and
              engineering (materials, electrical, mineral,  environmental and petroleum) will
              develop integrated and coordinated projects. While initiated  and tested at
              small schools, the approach can be generalized to larger institutions.
