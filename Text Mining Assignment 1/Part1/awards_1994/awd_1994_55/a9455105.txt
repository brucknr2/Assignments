Abstract    :
              Prince George's Community College, Largo, MD (PGCC) will hold a  five-day
              workshop in summer 1995, Integrating Computer Software  into Lower Division
              Engineering and Engineering Technology Courses.   The workshop will be for 20
              faculty from engineering, engineering  technology, and science, who teach lower
              division courses in  community colleges and senior institutions in the middle
              Atlantic  states.    The workshop will include lecture/demonstration,
              visualization  activities, and computer work with Math CAD, MicroCAP,
              LogicWorks,  and PADS.  Each participant will bring three problems from three 
              different courses to the workshop.  These will be solved during the  workshop
              and developed into a "book" of practice problems and  solutions which will be
              given each participant.  Applications will  be shown to Statics, Dynamics,
              Strength of Materials,  Thermodynamics, Electronics, and Physics Courses. 
              Workshop  participants will also be introduced to Internet and its uses and  to
              the work of the NSF Engineering Coalition, Engineering Coalition  of Schools
              for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL).   Follow-up activities
              include the development by PGCC of a computer  bulletin board to allow workshop
              faculty and other faculty in their  home institutions to communicate and assist
              one another,  presentations by workshop participants in their home
              institutions,  and presentations and papers for professional meetings.
