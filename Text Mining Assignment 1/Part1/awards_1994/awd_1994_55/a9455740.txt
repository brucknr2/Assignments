Abstract    :
              9455740  Ryan                                                          The
              project is producing several SVHS video tapes containing short  animated
              sequences to illustrate the applications of physics in  modern technology at a
              level suitable for introductory physics  courses. Although the primary audience
              consists of undergraduate  college students, the video tapes are also useful
              for high school  science students. The tapes are being prepared primarily
              through  the use of computer animation and SVHS video recording. Each tape 
              contains 5-10 minute expositions of several devices such as compact  discs,
              photocopier, telecommunication devices, computer chips,  computer displays and
              key boards, scanners, laser printers, fiber  optics, medical devices etc. These
              tapes will ultimately be  converted into laser disks by a commercial agency.
              Laser disks have  been chosen as the final product since they offer the most 
              flexibility and usefulness as an instructional medium.  This project helps
              bridge the gap between physics and technology by  bringing physics-based
              industrial and practical applications to the  introductory physics classroom.
              The teaching of such applications  in physics courses is essential in order
              that students understand  the value and use of physics in real life and should
              also make the  physics learning process more enjoyable and easier. Most physics
               instructors at present do not devote much time to technological  applications
              primarily because of class time considerations.  However with proper
              audio-visual means most technological  applications can be described in short
              animated sequences of about  5-10 minutes each. Once completed, these disks
              will be very useful  for supplementing physics instruction.
