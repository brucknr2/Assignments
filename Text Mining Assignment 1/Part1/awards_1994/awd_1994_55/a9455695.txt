Abstract    :
              This project provides students with accurate experience in the  laboratory of
              the scientific process and skills for solving real  life problems.  The project
              extends a three year pilot project that  uses collaborative computer based
              learning to meet the above goals.   Student groups explore the same general
              problem, but each group  uses different reagents.  A networked computer system
              (CoLABnet) is  used to collect, pool, and summarize the largely qualitative
              class  data.  The pooled data allow the students to examine more  parameters
              with better accuracy than would individual data.  The  discovery of trends is
              facilitated by presenting students with  multiple instances of the same
              phenomenon.  Groups use commercial  graphing software and communicate their
              findings during a post-lab  discussion.  Preliminary data from the pilot
              project indicate that  student learning and responses are improved by the new
              methods.   The project evaluates the impact on student learning, evaluates and 
              optimizes the design and implementation of software, develops new  software
              around a commercial database program, and develops and  implements a training
              and support system for TA's.  As part of the  TA training process, newly
              developed videotapes dealing with  instructional techniques relevant to the
              collaborative learning  classroom are used.
