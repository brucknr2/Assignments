Abstract    :
              This is a two-week workshop for undergraduate faculty with limited  access to
              parallel computers.  Participants learn to integrate  parallel processing into
              their courses.  Tools include transputers,  simulators, a network connection to
              a major research center, and  software to manage a network to workstations as a
              parallel  computing environment.  Topics include parallel algorithms, design 
              of parallel programs, parallel architectures, integration of  parallel
              processing into the undergraduate computer science  curriculum, and methods of
              teaching parallel processing to  undergraduates.  The workshop includes
              lectures and laboratory  sessions focusing on writing parallel programs and
              developing  curriculum materials.  The participants are expected to develop an 
              instructional unit on parallel processing that they will teach  during the
              1995-96 academic year.
