Abstract    :
              The Computer-Integrated Introductory Biology Lab (CIBL) project  is a four-year
              development effort to combine an innovative format  for undergraduate biology
              laboratories with a thematic,  cross-curricular approach to content instruction
              that integrates  biology, physics, chemistry, atmospheric sciences, and 
              mathematics. The CIBL laboratory supports and extends hands-on  "wet"
              laboratory experiences using computer-based multimedia  (interactive video,
              graphics, animation, sound and computer  simulation), while the thematic,
              interdisciplinary approach to  the curriculum unifies the enormous diversity of
              scientific  content. This effort transforms Biology 5L, the large  introductory
              biology class taken by virtually all life-science  majors attending UCLA
              (currently over 800 per year) from a  "barrier course" to a "facilitator
              course" as part of a larger  effort at UCLA to recruit and retain student
              enrollment in  science, especially within minority groups whose members are 
              under represented in scientific careers. The project develops and  will publish
              eight laboratory modules (in addition to two  currently under development
              through a pilot grant from the Hughes  Foundation), and will serve as a model
              for change in other large  introductory science courses across the country. 
              Students  preparing to be science teachers will be involved with design, 
              testing and evaluation of the course.
