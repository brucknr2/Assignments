Abstract    :
              9455980  Giordano  A Consortium of schools committed to the use of
              interdisciplinary  projects throughout their undergraduate programs in
              mathematics,  science, engineering and technology is being developed.  The 
              Consortium is planning to produce interdisciplinary application  projects which
              weld mathematics with the concepts of coequal  disciplines, to promote
              curricular reorganization focusing on  student growth in modeling and problem
              solving, and to promote  faculty growth through engaging them in such
              developmental  activities.
