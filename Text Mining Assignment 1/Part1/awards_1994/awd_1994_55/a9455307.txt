Abstract    :
              9455307  Hartley                                               Problem: Sending
              students to a local copy center to get copies of  class handouts is an
              inefficient, high cost method of distributing  class handouts. In addition, the
              full impact of algorithm  animations cannot be captured in snapshots on paper. 
              Solution: This project is to transform some operating systems and  concurrent
              programming handouts into a hypermedia laboratory manual  residing in files
              accessible by Drexel students from any network  location. The files are written
              in Hypertext Markup Language and  contain hyperlinks to program source code,
              screen snapshots, and  movies of algorithm animations in MPEG or Quick Time
              format.  Students use the Mosaic World-Wide Web browser program to access  the
              lab manual via Hypertext Transmission Protocol. Since the  Drexel dormitories
              are on the network, students are able to access  the lab manual from their
              rooms using their Macintoshes.  Impact and Significance: This is an innovative
              use of the  university computers and network to make handouts and other 
              documents available to students in an efficient, low cost manner.  Students and
              faculty at other institutions on the Internet will  also be able to access this
              hypermedia operating systems lab  manual.
