Abstract    :
              A two-week intensive workshop for college teachers of astronomy is  being
              offered each summer for the next 3 years.  The workshop  features a hands-on
              approach to laboratory work, both in the  laboratory and in the observatory. 
              The groups review current  laboratory resources and their adaptation to the
              needs of the  participants  institutions, participate in observing with small 
              telescopes, and interact with invited speakers concerning topics  currently at
              the forefront of astronomical research.  The resources  of Sommers-Bausch
              Observatory and Fiske Planetarium, both nearby on  the campus, are being fully
              utilized.
