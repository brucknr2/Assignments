Abstract    :
              The Coalition for Education in the Life Sciences (CELS), a  network of life
              science professional organizations, is requesting  support for three
              conferences in 1995, 1996, and 1997 on  undergraduate life science education. 
              These will be the CELS IV,  CELS V, and CELS VI conferences.  The conferences
              will emphasize  assessment of educational programs, development of a life 
              sciences electronic clearinghouse, dissemination of information  about
              exemplary programs, and ways for improving faculty and  graduate assistant
              teaching and course design.  CELS IV will be  held in June, 1995, at The
              University of Wisconsin, Madison; CELS  V in 1996 at the University of Nevada,
              Las Vegas; and CELS VI  will meet in Washington, DC.  The conferences will be
              limited to  175 participants to promote interaction and CELS encourages 
              faculty and administrators from the same institution to attend as  teams.  The
              format will include plenary sessions on broad topics  like assessment, smaller
              break-out discussions and hands-on  workshops, materials presentations and
              group discussions, and  demonstrations that show effective teaching.  The
              outcome will be  teaching materials and conference proceedings, which will be 
              disseminated through all the professional societies supporting  CELS and a
              self-sustaining CELS network for ongoing work in this  important area of
              undergraduate life sciences education.
