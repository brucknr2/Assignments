Abstract    :
              9455570  Chapman  The UCLA Science Challenge began in 1991 as a five-year
              program  with a mission to bring innovative, research-level instruction to 
              undergraduates, particularly lower division students in order to  retain
              lower-division science majors, recruit new science majors,  attract more
              minority students to science, and to improve student  attitudes toward science.
              The goal is to infuse every lower  division course in the physical sciences
              with new material and to  create new interdisciplinary courses that reflect the
              breadth and  overlap of the physical and life science disciplines. As we enter 
              the fourth year of the program, we are on target to meet our  charge.  During
              the first half of the project, we primarily  attacked both the largest general
              education classes in the  division, the Astronomy and Atmospheric Science
              courses, which  collectively enroll 8000 non-science majors each year, and also
               courses for the physical science majors in Chemistry and Physics.  Our major
              focus now will be on the Physics course for Life  Science majors. Our minor
              focus, for the enormous General  Chemistry course that all Life Science and
              Physical Science  majors must take, will concentrate on modules that allow
              students  to visualize 3-dimensional molecular and crystalline structures.  We
              will keep a small presence in the Earth and Space Science  department, in
              Astronomy, and in Atmospheric Science in order to  maintain the coherence of
              the renovation of the Physical Sciences  at UCLA and to fulfill our commitment
              to complete the modules  which these departments have begun.
