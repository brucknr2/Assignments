Abstract    :
              9455646  Greenbowe  The objectives of this project are to research, develop, and
               incorporate three modular instructional resources on modern  instrumentation
              in the first two years of college chemistry. The  modules will contain
              instrumentation-oriented components dealing  with current real-world topics,
              group projects, updated teaching  methods, student learning assessments,
              emphasis on conceptual  thinking interactive multimedia and exploratory
              laboratory  experiments. Development of interactive, multimedia computer 
              programs that simulate the operations of the FT-IR, and FT-NMR  spectrometers,
              from sample handling to data acquisition and work-up  will be developed in
              collaboration with Engineering Animation, Inc.  A UV-VIS multimedia simulation
              has already been developed at the  University of California at San Diego. A
              consortium of Iowa's 15  community colleges, three public universities, and
              four private  colleges will collaborate on all aspects of the project through 
              long-distance video conferences on Iowa's fiber-optics  communication network
              and at annual summer workshops. This project  will enable students and faculty
              in the entire state of Iowa to  have facile access to modern instrumentation
              (UV-VIS, FT-IR and FT-  NMR) via computer simulations. Iowa State university
              will serve as  a clearing house for running actual chemical samples submitted
              by  students of the participating institutions. The samples will be run  on
              instruments at Iowa State University, and the spectra will be  made available
              to the students and faculty from the community  colleges and private colleges
              over the internet (via anon ftp,the  world wide web, or by e-mail) as digital
              files or graphic images.  This project will provide new curriculum enhancements
              and  developments to four-year institutions and all community colleges  in the
              state of Iowa.
