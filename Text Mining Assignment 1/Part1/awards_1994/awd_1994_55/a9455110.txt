Abstract    :
              This program funds for three years the portion of the new  Distinguished
              Speakers Program of the National Association of  Geology Teachers (NAGT) aimed
              at enhancing the abilities of faculty  to teach undergraduate geology
              effectively and innovatively at both  introductory and upper levels.  While
              many visiting speaker  programs focus on research, the NAGT Distinguished
              Speakers Program  focuses on geoscience teaching and learning.  A visit by a
              NAGT  speaker will give faculty members in the host department an  opportunity
              to learn first-hand from an exemplary and enthusiastic  geoscience educator
              about innovative curricula and techniques that  work in the classroom,
              laboratory, and field.  Grant funds will  partially underwrite these faculty
              enhancement visits.  They  involve application to the NAGT Speakers Bureau (c/o
              Barbara  Tewksbury) outlining a list of desired speakers and the reasons for 
              interest in the host department.  If specific agreement is reached,  a visit of
              roughly two days including lectures, workshops, and  discussions is set up, and
              followup activities aimed at  facilitating the desired change are scheduled. 
              The program covers  most costs of the speaker; costs of local transportation,
              food,  lodging, and materials are borne by the host institution.
