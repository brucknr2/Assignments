Abstract    :
                            9413112  HALL  This archaeological project in northwestern
              interior Alaska seeks  to  elucidate  the character of the Ipiutak and Late 
              Prehistoric  cultures  which  span the transition between the  4000  year  old 
              Arctic Small Tool tradition and recent peoples of the region. The  Ipiutak 
              culture  contrasts dramatically  with  Late  Prehistoric  cultures and various
              hypotheses to explain these differences will  be  tested  using excavated data
              from numerous sites.  Points  of  comparison will include settlement patterns,
              subsistence systems,  house  forms,  tool types and paleoenvironmental  data. 
              Although  some  new fieldwork will be undertaken, a major component of  the 
              project   consists  of  analysis  of  previously  excavated   but  unpublished 
              material. The product will stand  as  a  significant  contribution  to 
              anthropology and to the knowledge  of  cultural  development in Alaska.  ***
