Abstract    :
              9413157  Warner    In this project, the PI will collect and analyze samples for 
              Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) on WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP)  sections,
              I-5W/I-4 (25degS and 30degS), and I-1 (Zonal section  along 8degS), as part of
              the WOCE Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE).   Specific objectives include a study
              of ventilation of Intermediate  Waters formed in the Red Sea (I-1), and a study
              of mixing rates in  Western Boundary Currents (I-5W/I-4), using the CFC's along
              with  velocity measurements from geostrophic calculations and Acoustic  Doppler
              Current Profilers.  ***
