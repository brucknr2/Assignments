Abstract    :
              9413169  Key  This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean Circulation 
              Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP).  The  PI will
              collect water samples to be analyzed for Carbon-14  (radiocarbon) concentration
              on the first two legs of the  expedition, denoted as WOCE lines I8S and I9S,
              respectively, as  well as on most of the other lines over the 1995 period. 
              Lines I8S  and I9S are essentially meridional lines along 115 degrees east, 
              and 85 to 95 degrees east between about 30 degrees South and the  Antarctic
              continent.  Specific objectives include a comparison of  these measurements of
              bomb-injected C-14 with similar measurements  made in 1978 in order to quantify
              mixing rates into the thermocline  over a 17-year time scale.  Measurements
              will also contribute to a  study of the deep water circulation in the western
              South Australia  Basin, and the formation of Subantarctic Mode Water Antarctic 
              Intermediate Water along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  ***
