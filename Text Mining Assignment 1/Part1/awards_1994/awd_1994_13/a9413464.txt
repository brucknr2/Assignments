Abstract    :
              9413464  Viney  This instrument is to be used on research projects that include:
               (a) real-time studies of the assembly of materials, structures  and molecular
              machinery at sub-cellular scales; (b) the  hierarchial assembly of fibrous,
              tubular and network protein  structures outside cells; (c) studies of inorganic
              crystal  nucleation on engineered protein templates leading to the  improved
              design of novel polymer/ceramic composites; (d) the  deformation and fracture
              properties of biological materials; (e)  rational design of biomaterials (e.g.,
              implants, contract lenses)  based on their observed structure and interaction
              with biological  media; (f) the effect of gaseous environment on high
              temperature  sintering reactions in ceramics; and (g) cermets: the effect of 
              environment and ceramic surface characteristics on wettability by  liquid
              metals.  An interdisciplinary group of researchers at the  University of
              Washington is to utilize this instrument.  ***
