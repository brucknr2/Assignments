Abstract    :
              9413165  Olson  In this project, the PI will serve as co-chief scientist on two 
              Hydrographic lines in the Indian Ocean, designated as lines I7N and  I9N by the
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment.  Line I7N crosses  the Arabian Sea in a
              more or less meridional section, coordinating  with the Joint Global Ocean Flux
              Study (JGOFS), another Global  Change Research Program in the Arabian Sea. 
              Line I9N crosses the  Bay of Bengal from the Ganges delta to near the equator. 
              Focus of  this research will be on the meridional distributions of properties 
              in the major basins, and a number of boundary flows along the  Broken Ridge (SE
              Indian Ocean), the northern Bay of Bengal, through  Arminate Passage, along the
              Carlesberg Ridge, and off the coast of  Oman. The data will also apply to
              studies of along-equator flow in  the Somali and Cocos basins.
