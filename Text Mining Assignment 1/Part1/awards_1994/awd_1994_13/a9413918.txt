Abstract    :
                   Mass spectrometry has become one of the most powerful  tools for measuring
              molecular weights of peptides and  proteins, and for determining their primary
              structures. Thus  mass spectrometry is of central importance to biotechnology, 
              biochemistry, and biological research. Fourier transform  mass spectrometry is
              emerging as the premier high-  performance mass spectrometer for the analysis
              of biological  compounds. This proposal seeks funding to advance the 
              development of several high-performance capabilities of  Fourier transform mass
              spectrometry for peptide and protein  analysis, and to make these readily
              available in a  commercial mass spectrometer. This project will be a joint 
              effort between the P.I. and Bruker Instruments, Inc., a  manufacturer of a
              commercial Fourier transform mass  spectrometer. The requested funds will be
              used to purchase a  Fourier transform mass spectrometer from Bruker
              Instruments.  Hardware, software, and technique developments will be  pursued
              jointly by the P.I. and Bruker Instruments. In  addition to the development
              efforts, this instrument will  also be used to support the research and
              training programs  of members of the Center for Metalloenzyme Studies, a NSF 
              supported Research Training Group at the University of  Georgia.
