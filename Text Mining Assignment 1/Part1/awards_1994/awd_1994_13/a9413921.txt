Abstract    :
              9413921  Landsman  This Academic Research Infrastructure Program proposal 
              involves the development of a cellular research facility.  The cellular
              research program at the Scholl College  emphasizes the study of diseases
              involving the  musculoskeletal and vascular system of the lower  extremities. 
              This program offers a unique form of cellular  engineering in which cells will
              be examined in dynamic  environments.  Chronic repetitive mechanical
              stimulation  associated with ambulation ultimately leads to numerous 
              significant changes in the foot.  Diabetic and neuropathic  patients develop
              plantar ulcerations, and arthritic joints  become further degenerated as a
              result of this trauma.  Conversely, osteoporotic bones become more fragile, due
              to  the inability of certain patients to accumulate and retain  bone substance.
               The understanding of the relationship  between macroscopic mechanical
              stimulation, and its  expression at the cellular level is not well developed. 
              New  methods and equipment used to apply specifically controlled  loads to
              cells in culture is critical to study these  cellular responses.  The focus of
              this research will be to  develop the specialized equipment needed to carry out
              these  experiments.  ***
