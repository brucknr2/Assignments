Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed STTR effort is to develop compact infrared
              laser based gas sensors for the identification and monitoring of molecular
              species.  Ultimately, a series of  infrared sources, each designed to monitor a
              particular one or two molecular working the region form 3 to 6 um  is planned. 
                     There is a demonstrable need for gas monitoring in variety of
              application an IR spectroscopic methods offer significant advantages for
              versatile in situ detection of a large number of species.  However, existing
              system such as FTIR are not portable, are not rugged, and can be influenced by
              any backgrounds effects.  The new systems will incorporate solid-state
              technology to produce a compact reasonable rugged, portable systems as a
              reasonable cost with high spectral resoultion for certain species
              identification and accurate absorption measurement that can be left unattended
              for  long periods of time while reporting gas concentrations by telemetry. 
              Results of the research could have commercial application in industrial process
              monitoring and pollution control.
