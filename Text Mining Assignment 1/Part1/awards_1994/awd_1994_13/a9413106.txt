Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Novak of the  
              University of Massachusetts will design, prepare, and study the use of  
              organometallic catalysts for the "living" polymerization of isocyanides   and
              other unsaturated monomers. The reactivity and applicability of new   Ni(I),
              Ni(II), Ni(III), and Pd(II) catalysts will be  exploited in order   to
              synthesize novel di- and tri-block copolymers for application as  
              thermoplastic elastomers. The premise to be tested is that the reactivity   of
              polymer endgroups can be altered in predictable fashion to produce   unique
              substances.    This research will use new catalysts to prepare new carbon
              containing   polymers that incorporate other elements into the polymer
              skeleton. New   thermoplastic polymers will be prepared whose properties may
              prove   superior  in the manufacture of vehicles, consumer products such as  
              furniture, and novel materials to be used in areas of advanced technology.
