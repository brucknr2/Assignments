Abstract    :
              9413858  Freeman   This award provides funding for acquisition of a real-time
              multiprocessor host computer system for the Iowa Driving Simulator (IDS) at the
              University of Iowa.  The addition of the new host computer system will create a
              unique facility to support research ranging from development of new engineering
              design and analysis methodologies to the study of basic human factors problems.
              The IDS is a fully-immersive ground vehicle driving simulator that provides
              high fidelity visual, motion, audio, and force feedback cues to the driver.    
              The new host computer will enhance IDS performance in the areas of
              high-fidelity vehicle modeling and realistic representation of the external
              driving environment.  The additional modeling fidelity will allow
              experimentation with advanced operator--in-the-loop virtual prototyping
              concepts for vehicle and heavy equipment design, and will provide a rich
              environment for the study of human behavior and performance issues.  The
              upgraded facility will support the research and academic programs of ten
              faculty, approximately seventy-five graduate students, and a dozen
              undergraduate from four engineering disciplines, computer science, and several
              other departments.
