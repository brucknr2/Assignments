Abstract    :
              9413168  Kosro  In this project, the PI will use a shipboard Acoustic Doppler 
              Current Profiler (ADCP) to measure vertical profiles of currents  beneath the
              ship as it collects hydrographic and tracer data along  a zonal section at
              latitude 20 degrees South.  This work is a  component of the U.S. contribution
              to the World Ocean Circulation  Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Expedition
              (IOE).  The focus of  these observations will be, on ageostrophic surface Ekman
              transport  in the open ocean, and on the spatially-confined boundary currents 
              near the coasts - the Leeuwin Current off western Australia, and  the East
              Madagascar Current to the east of Madagascar.  In  addition, near the
              boundaries, a lowered ADCP will be used to full  ocean depth to resolve deep
              boundary currents.  ***
