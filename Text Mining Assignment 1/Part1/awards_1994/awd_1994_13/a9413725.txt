Abstract    :
              9413725  Ansari, Farhad    This is an instrumentation award.  A new class of
              concrete, high-  performance concrete (HPC), is emerging, whose performance
              cannot  be  predicted  by  extrapolation from knowledge  of  conventional 
              concrete.   It provides a strong incentive to move the  technical  basis  for 
              concrete  technology  from  empiricism  to  materials  science  to  ensure 
              that  developments  in  HPC  have  a   solid  foundation  and  draw  on
              developments in materials  science  and  technology, and in techniques for
              prediction of service life  and  control  of  the  design  life of cementitious
               composites.   The  development of research programs in high-performance
              cementitious  composites  is  hindered by the lack of pertinent instrumentation
               to  support such programs.  The instrumentation will enhance  the  state  of
              ongoing research, and will provide the university  with  tools  for  the 
              research  and  development  of  high-performance  concrete.    There  is  a 
              critical  need  for   development   of  methodologies for the optimization of
              the critical procedures  in  the  manufacture  and  processing  of  HPC, 
              beginning  with  the  selection  and  preparation of the constituent 
              materials,  their  proportioning  and  mixing, and continuing  through  placing
               and  curing.   The equipment in this project will be employed  in  the 
              research  for  characterization of fine particle  industrial  by-  products for
              the development of high-performance concretes.  ***
