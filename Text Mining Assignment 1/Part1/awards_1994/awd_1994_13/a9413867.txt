Abstract    :
              9413867  Moulton  This partnership of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Research 
              Institute, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, the University of  Massachusetts,
              Lowell and the is focused on meeting the  manufacturing engineering needs of
              Massachusetts' growing  biotechnology and biomedical industries by retraining
              displaced  defense engineers.  Some of the features of this program include 
              quick "retooling" in biology and chemistry, a two-track  certificate path, a
              four- to six-month paid practicum at a  biotechnology or biomedical company,
              and the use of intelligent  computer tutoring systems.  With some additional
              work,  "retrainees" can earn a master's degree.  ***
