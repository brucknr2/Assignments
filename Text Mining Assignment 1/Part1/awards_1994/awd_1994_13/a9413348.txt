Abstract    :
              9413348  Myers       This award provides one-half of the funding required  for
              the acquisition of an electron microprobe instrument  system to be installed
              and operated in the Department of  Geology and Geophysics at the University of
              Wyoming. The  University is committed to providing the remaining funds  needed
              to acquire the instrument. The new electron  microprobe will be used in
              research and teaching projects  requiring accurate elemental analysis of
              geological samples  with microscale spatial resolution in areas such as
              igneous,  metamorphic and sedimentary petrology, geochemical  weathering cycle
              and soil formation, diagenesis in petroleum  and gas bearing sediments, and
              mineral deposits.  ***
