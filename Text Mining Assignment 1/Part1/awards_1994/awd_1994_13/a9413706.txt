Abstract    :
              9413706  Rivers       This award provides partial funding required to design, 
              purchase the components of, and install X-ray detector  systems for a group of
              five experimental stations comprising  the GeoCARS sector at the Advanced
              Photon Source (APS) of  Argonne National Laboratory. The University of
              Chicago's  Consortium for Advance Radiation Sources (CARS) is committed  to
              providing the remaining funds needed to complete the X-  ray detector system.
              GeoCARS is an organizational sub-unit  of CARS, dedicated to the construction
              and operation of a  multi-user facility at APS designed to meet the needs of
              the  earth science research community in using synchrotron  radiation. The APS,
              to be commissioned at Argonne in 1995,  will provide hard X-rays with 1000
              times higher brilliance  than the brightest existing synchrotron source in the
              U.S.,  and the earth science research community will gain access to  this
              powerful tool for characterizing the structure and  composition of earth
              materials by making use of the GeoCARS  sector's experimental stations at APS.
              The extremely high X-  ray brilliance available will permit unprecedented
              levels of  spatial and energy resolution in X-ray diffraction and  scattering,
              X-ray absoption spectroscopy, and X-ray  microprobe and microtomography studies
              applied to earth  science research in ultra-high pressure, environmental 
              geochemistry, soils science and agronomy, and waste  disposal. The goal of this
              project is to instrument the  GeoCARS sector at APS with X-ray detectors that
              will take  full advantage of the spatial, energy, and time resolution 
              characteristics of this remarkable and powerful new X-ray  source.  ***
