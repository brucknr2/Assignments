Abstract    :
              9413149  Singhal       The Production and Operations Management Society is
              holding  two workshops for engineering and business faulty in the areas of 
              International Technology Management and Total Quality Management,  (TQM).  The
              workshop on international management of technology will  cover a wide range of
              related topics, including design,  manufacturing, and decision making.  The TQM
              workshop will cover  both design and manufacturing.       These two areas are
              quite critical to the nation's  competitiveness, and yet their development in
              education, research  and training is lagging.  Almost all business and
              engineering  colleges are trying to develop courses and research agendas in the
               areas.  The objective of these workshops is to facilitate these  efforts.
