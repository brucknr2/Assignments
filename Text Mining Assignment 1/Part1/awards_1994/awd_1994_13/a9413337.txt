Abstract    :
              9413337  Donahue       This award provides partial funding for the upgrade of  a
              2-megavolt tandem particle accelerator operated at the  University of Arizona
              as part of the NSF-Arizona AMS  Facility (Accelerator-based Mass Spectrometry).
              The  accelerator is operated as a multi-user facility for 14C age  dating of a
              wide variety of natural samples and artifacts.  Science applications range from
              global change to  archeological. The upgrade will consist of the addition of a 
              high-energy analyzing magnet system, accelerator terminal  insulating supports,
              a high frequency pulser, and an  injection system electrostatic analyzer. The
              upgrade is  aimed specifically at decreasing the turn-around time for  analyses
              by increasing the throughput capabilities of the  accelerator and decreasing
              the chances of machine down-time.   ***
