Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT          It is our intention to establish a cytophotometry  facility
              in the St. Olaf  Biology Department for both  research and training purposes.
              Such a facility requires a  microscope equipped with a light source and filters
              that  allow for absorbency measurements at two wavelengths, a  microscope image
              processor, and a photometer.          A cytophotometer will allow us perform
              accurate,  quantitative measurements of nuclear DNA content. This  capability
              will greatly expand upon our research efforts to  analyze nuclear and
              chromosomal behavior during both normal  and aberrant conjugation in the
              ciliated protozoan  Tetrahvmena thermophila. Specifically, we will be better 
              able to characterize the nuclear behavior of conjugation  mutants that affect
              both meiotic and mitotic divisions, as  well as the differentiation of newly
              formed polyploid  macronuclei.
