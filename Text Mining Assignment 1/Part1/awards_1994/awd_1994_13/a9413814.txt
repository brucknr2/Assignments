Abstract    :
              9413814  Good       State-of-the-art equipment to support research in the Web 
              Handling Research Center (WHRC) will be developed.  The WHRC is a  National
              Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center in its
              ninth year of operation with twenty  corporate sponsors. The term "web"
              describes materials that  are manufactured and processed in a continuous-strip
              form, e.g.,  thin plastics, paper, textiles, metals, and composites.  Web 
              handling refers to the physical mechanics related to the transport  and control
              of continuous-strip materials through processes and  machines.  The equipment
              to be acquired will support several  research projects, including:  (1) winding
              webs at high speed and  accelerations, (2) longitudinal dynamics and tension
              control in  multi-span web transport systems, and (3) the wrinkling of webs.   
                 The sucessful research performed with the web line should have  an impact
              upon productivity within web handling industries.  The  amount of web handling
              which is done within industry is immense as  many automated manufacturing
              processes demand the continuous strip  form.  The investigator's will be able
              to validate and improve  some of the most critical mathematical models that
              have been  developed.  The result will be an improved knowledge base  which
              engineers can use to design web process lines  that produce the required
              product without  defects and losses  resulting in improved productivity.
