Abstract    :
              proposal# 9413561  PI - Scheer    The STTR is an outgrowth  of two different R&D
              efforts leading to two product lines originally targeted to science education: 
              Bioluminescence and the Labless Lab DB1 TM.  These two unique and very
              different technologies can be combined to produce what on might call analytical
              chemistry without instruments.  The basic idea is to build the entire
              instrument into the sampling device.  Readout and detection utilizes light
              produced by bioluminescence.  Specificity is provided by the use of enzymes. 
              In this project the focus is on direct analysis of ATP using firefly luciferase
              coupled with others enzyme-mediated biochemical processes which either produce
              or consume ATP.  The sensors utilize stable luciferase/luciferin films coupled
              to a capillarity- based sample distribution system.  The result will be
              specific, quantitative, rapid, direct reading, inexpensive and disposable
              analytical devices.
