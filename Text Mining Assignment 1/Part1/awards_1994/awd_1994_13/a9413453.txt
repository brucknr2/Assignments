Abstract    :
              Chandra  Abstract           Studies of Polarimetric Signatures in Winter and
              Spring                Time Storms Using the CSU-CHILL Radar           The
              objective of this research is to study polarimetric  signatures in winter and
              spring time storms using the CSU-CHILL  radar.  Special emphasis will be placed
              on Neural network/Fourier  descriptor based image classification techniques to
              process 2D-PM   images of hydrometeors for insitu comparison with polarimetric 
              signatures.  The significance of the new high performance low side  lobe
              antenna system of the CSU-CHILL radar for studying  polarimetric signatures
              will b observed.  Spatial and temporal  evolution of polarimetric radar
              signatures will be studied to  develop average signatures in several
              hydrometeor habit regions.   Multidimensional parameter set will be used for
              classification of  hydrometeor and precipitation types.  The overall goal is to
              study  the application of polarimetric radar signatures to study the type  and
              distribution of precipitation in winter and spring storms.
