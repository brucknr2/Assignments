Abstract    :
              Abstract - Clark - 9413890    The goal of this research is to develop a working
              understanding of microwave interactions with materials that will enable
              targeted industrial operations to apply microwave technologies to product
              manufacturing.  The system to be studied will be that of sol-gel-derived
              silica.  A silicon alkoxide precursor mixed with water and alcohol will undergo
              reactions under the influence of both microwave and conventional heating
              techniques.  Using Fourier transform infrared (FTIRS) and electron spin
              resonance (ESR) spectroscopies as well as a new technique for measuring the
              effects of microwave irradiation during processing -- a cavity ring-down
              apparatus outfitted with a microwave applicator -- the effects of microwave
              energy and conventional heating on molecular bond formation/dissociation of
              each individual component of the sol and the sol itself will be examined. 
              Dielectric property measurements will be performed on the sol, gel and solid
              components at microwave frequencies (and temperatures) over which the reactions
              will take place.  This approach will enable a correlation between dielectric
              properties, the molecular/phase changes, reaction extent and the resultant
              properties of the chemicals/materials during the various stages of microwave
              processing.    The silica system will be used because: (1) it is a well-studied
              material system that will allow for comparison with current standards and
              targeted properties; (2) it will allow for evaluation of the microwave/material
              interactions from liquid through solid states; and (3) it is an industrially
              important material for applications ranging from optical lenses and fibers to
              high-temperature, corrosion-resistant windows.
