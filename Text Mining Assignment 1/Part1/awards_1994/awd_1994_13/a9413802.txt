Abstract    :
                This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at San Diego State University acquire a 400 MHz NMR
              spectrometer which will be  used in research.  The research activity to be
              supported includes the transmetallation of  organic groups between boron and
              metals, designing new helical metal ligand systems for  use as asymmetric
              catalysts, the synthesis of bromofluoroalkanes, studying the  electrochemistry
              of redox-dependent receptors of organic molecules, and hormonally-  regulated
              integral membrane ecto-ATPase.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
              is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown  substances,
              characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the 
              dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
