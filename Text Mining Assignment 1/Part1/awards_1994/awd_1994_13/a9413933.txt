                                        ABSTRACT                                  STI-9413933 
              Welch, William J.    This project will increase the number of antennas in the 
              Berkeley, Illinois, Maryland Association (BIMA) Array from  nine to 11, thereby
              increasing its speed and sensitivity,  and will increase the angular resolution
               of the array to  0.1" (HST resolution) by adding stations which produce one 
              kilometer baselines both East-West and North- South.  Optical fiber will be
              used to interconnect them.         Much of the unique and important science to
              arise from  millimeter interferometers has resulted from their superior 
              spatial resolution compared to large single antennas.  Current millimeter
              arrays are limited to resolutions of 1.5"  to 3" by the maximum available
              separations between antennas.  However, this resolution is not a fundamental
              limit.  Extrapolation from experience with current millimeter arrays  suggests
              that observations should be successful on several  kilometer baselines during
              good weather.  The important new  science that this development will enable
              includes adequate  resolution to fully image star formation, the study of rich 
              interstellar chemistry in distant clouds, imaging Active  Galactic Nuclei, and
              imaging the important smaller members  of the solar system.  ***
