Abstract    :
                Upgrading our Instrumentation to include a new state-of-the-art  quadrupole
              mass spectrometer equipped with modern electro- spray  ionization will allow us
              to meet the needs of these young  investigators, thereby expanding our user
              base while enhancing  their Research productivty and training opportunties. The
               capability is currently not available in the West Virginia  University system,
              and Its acquisition will improve the  accessibility of biochemical researchers
              in the region to this  rapidly emerging  technique for biomolecular structure 
              determination.
