Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9413301  X. C. Zeng, U. of Nebraska, Lincoln    The objective is
              to develop a nucleation theory based on statistical mechanics
              (density-functional approach and the Monte Carlo simulation) which would agree
              with the experimental facts previously unexplained by other nucleation
              theories.   The rate of  nucleation in both gases (droplet formation) and
              liquids (cavitation, boiling), as well as related characteristics such as
              critical supersaturation and the tensile strength, will be determined .  Five
              types of fluids systems will be investigated to test the theory.  Together with
              Dr. D. V. Oxtoby (University of Chicago), the P. I. has proposed an original
              approach, which may lead to fundamental advances in the field of nucleation.   
              The nucleation theory to be developed in this project has relevance on the
              formation of hazardous aerosols, photochemical smog, acid rain, green house
              effect in the troposphere, cloud formation and in other areas of environmental
              science.  A second area of relevance is in materials synthesis form aerosol
              precursors.  ***
