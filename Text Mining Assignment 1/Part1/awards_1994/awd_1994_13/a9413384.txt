Abstract    :
              9413384  Woodrow       This award provides partial funding for the acquisition 
              of a side-scanning sonar system and a seismic reflection  profiling system by
              Hobart and William Smith Colleges. The  two systems generate complementary
              images of the subsurface  and will be used in the study of sediments and other 
              subsurface structures in lakes, river and estuary  environments. The equipment
              will be stored at Hobart and  Smith Colleges, and its use and maintenance will
              be managed  by Hobart and Smith Colleges and Colgate University. The 
              applications of the geophysical imaging systems will include  studies of the
              Finger Lakes and Great Lakes in faculty  research projects as well as
              independent student research  projects and use in science training for
              undergraduate and  graduate students. The equipment will be available for use 
              by faculty and students from a total of nine upstate New  York institutions.
