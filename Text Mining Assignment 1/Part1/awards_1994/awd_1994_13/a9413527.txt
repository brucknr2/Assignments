Abstract    :
              9413527  Przybycien  The Raman Spectrometer is to be dedicated to support
              research in  biotechnology.  In particular, the spectrometer is to be use for 
              the structural characterization of protein samples obtained from  bioprocessing
              environments.  The primary mode of operation will  be conventional spectral
              acquisition for protein structural  estimation as well as more fundamental
              research into the use of  low-frequency Raman spectra for more refined
              estimates of protein  structure.  the spectrometer is to support research
              projects in  the chemical engineering, chemistry, and physics departments at 
              Rensselaer as well as faculty at Princeton University and the  University of
              Texas at Austin.  ***
