Abstract    :
              9413181  Goltz  This award is being made through the Small Grants for
              Exploratory  Research program.  It will involve the collection of perishable 
              data on the use of near real-time loss and damage data by the  State of
              California in the aftermath of the Northridge,  California earthquake of
              January 17, 1994.  The study will  examine how shaking intensity maps,
              estimates of casualties,  displaced individuals, and damage, all made available
              in the  hours and days after the event, were used by agencies of state 
              government to direct emergency response activities, plan for  recovery, and to
              discuss cost sharing issues with the federal  government.  This research will
              provide insight into the  application of new and rapid methods of loss
              estimation to  disaster response and recovery policy.  ***
