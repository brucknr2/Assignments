Abstract    :
              9413338  Chang       Calculations of single and multiphoton ionization,
              resonance  energies and widths of doubly excited states, fine structure  level
              splittings and oscillator strengths will be performed in  divalent atoms using
              the B-spline technique.  The aim is to  obtain a quantitative understanding of
              the role of electron  correlation in atomic continuum processes.  ***
