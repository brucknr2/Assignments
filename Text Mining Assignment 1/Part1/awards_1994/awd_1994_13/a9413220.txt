Abstract    :
              9413220  Ketterson  This award renews support of a joint effort of 14 faculty
              that provides education and research training for undergraduate, graduate and
              postdoctoral students.  This Research Training Group (RTG) is a central focus
              of the recently-established Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior
              at Indiana University.  The faculty, who come from the Departments of Biology,
              Psychology, Law, and Medical Sciences, bring six subdisciplinary perspectives
              to the RTG: sensory physiology, behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology,
              developmental psychobiology, animal learning, and behavioral neuroscience. 
              Graduate students who participate in the RTG are drawn from three graduate
              programs: biology, psychology and an interdisciplinary program in neuroscience.
               The RTG provides students with academic year and summer assistantships, travel
              support or research support.    The courses, seminars and other educational
              activities of the RTG result from the integration across 5 areas of research:
              communication, sex and reproductive behavior, learning and motivation, ontogeny
              and evolution, and spatial organization of behavior.  As well as representing
              natural combinations of faculty research interests, these areas provide foci
              for the development of student research projects.  Several of the courses
              required of RTG trainees have been newly developed by RTG faculty; students
              must also participate in a year-long seminar on scientific integrity developed
              jointly by the RTG and the Poynter Center for Study of Ethics and American
              Institutions.  In addition to the core faculty, there are 10 adjunct faculty in
              five other departments whose have related research interests and whose students
              benefit from the courses and seminars and other educational activities of the
              RTG.  ***
