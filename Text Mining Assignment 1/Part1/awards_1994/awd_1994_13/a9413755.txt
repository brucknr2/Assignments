Abstract    :
              Winsborough    With National Science Foundation support, the University of 
              Wisconsin's Social Sciences Computing Co-operative will purchase  a Fiber
              Distributed Data Interface backbone for its extensive  computing network. This
              high-bandwidth backbone is necessary to  the very data-intensive research done
              in the Co-op. work which  uses a 50 gigabyte, on-line, data base of government
              and  privately collected data files from the U.S. and around the  world. The
              current network is an amalgam of older and more modern  equipment using a 10
              mb/s ethernet specification. Some of the  older technology is slow and some is
              fragile and this seriously  impedes research. The backbone is overloaded in the
              older part of  its topology and peak daily loads are several times industry 
              recommendations. It has become fragile and causes frequent  interruptions for
              researchers along its path. The network to be  constructed will have from 30 to
              60 times the current bandwidth.  It will both serve current users and add
              Department of Economics  researchers to the system.    The Social Sciences
              Computing Co-operative is composed of five  research and teaching agencies in
              the University of Wisconsin and  includes the Center for Demography and
              Ecology,  the Department  of Sociology, the Department of Rural Sociology, the
              Institute on  Aging and Adult Life and the Institute for Research on Poverty. 
              About 100 faculty and their teams of graduate assistants and  professional
              researchers use the co-op facilities. The research  conducted focuses on human
              resources, demography and the causes  and consequences of global change,
              especially as it relates to  the physical environment. The work contributes in
              a significant  way to the increase in basic scientific knowledge much of it 
              relevant to pressing national needs.
