              Kontnik  This project, supported under the Technology Deployment activity area
              of the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP), is designed to identify, extract
              and transition biomedical technologies from a number of sources.  The goals
              include helping defense firms understand the opportunities for diversification,
              and assisting a limited number of firms to actually embark on a business course
              of diversification. Some of these firms will be incorporated into an on-site
              incubator.  This project will be coordinated closely with the National
              Institutes of Health, the Colorado Advanced Technology Institute, and the
              Colorado research universities.  It will build on established relationships
              with a number of target companies, including Martin Marietta.  %%%  The
              objective of the TRP is to stimulate the transition to a growing, integrated,
              national industrial capability which provides the most advanced, affordable,
              military systems and the most competitive commercial products.  TRP programs
              are structured to expand high quality employment opportunities in commercial 
              and dual-use US. industries and demonstrably enhance US. competitiveness.  This
              is accomplished through the application of defense and commercial resources to
              develop dual-use technologies, manufacturing and technology assistance to small
              firms, and education and training programs that enhance US. manufacturing
              skills and target displaced defense industry workers.  This specific project
              will enable a number of defense-based companies in Colorado to enter the
              biomedical product arena, thereby allowing them to diversify their product base
              into the non-defense  sector.      ~
