Abstract    :
                This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at Delaware State University acquire a Pulsed 60 MHz
              NMR spectrometer which will  be used in research.  The research activity to be
              supported includes the characterization of  various transition metal complexes,
              the chemical elucidation of organic structures, the use  of NMR as a
              confirmation tool in forensic chemistry, and in kinetic studies dealing with
              the  instability of boron complexes.     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
