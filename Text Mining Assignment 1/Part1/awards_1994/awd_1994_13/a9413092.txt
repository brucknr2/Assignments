Abstract    :
              9413092  Magrab       The University of Maryland will introduce manufacturing 
              education across its undergraduate curriculum by folding its  long-established
              relationships with industry, its large  manufacturing research program, and its
              advanced research  facilities into its undergraduate engineering programs. 
              This new  curriculum will give every student the experience of working in 
              product development teams through industrially-sponsored  multi-disciplinary
              design and prototyping projects.  Moreover, this  curriculum will broaden the
              student's perspective by teaching the  manufacturing enterprise as the
              integration of engineering,  business, and management challenges.  This new
              curriculum will link  course content directly to faculty research while
              creating a group  of faculty who can teach a wide variety of manufacturing
              subjects  at any academic level.
