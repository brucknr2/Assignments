Abstract    :
              9413167  McCartney  This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean
              Circulation  Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP).  The
               PI will provide hydrographic support and scientific leadership for  the first
              two legs of the expedition, denoted as WOCE lines I8S and  I9S, respectively. 
              These are essentially meridional lines along  115 degrees east, and 85 to 95
              degrees east between about 30  degrees South and the Antarctic continent. 
              Specific objectives  include study of the deep water circulation in the western
              South  Australia Basin, and the formation of Subantarctic Mode Water  Antarctic
              Intermediate Water along the Antarctic Circumpolar  Current.  ***
