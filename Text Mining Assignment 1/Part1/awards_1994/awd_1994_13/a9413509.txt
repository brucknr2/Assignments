Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for funds to acquire a multi-task system for  automated
              analysis of mutations and polymorphisms and for drastically  expanded capacity
              of automated DNA sequencing. The funds are intended  to upgrade an existing DNA
              sequencer as well as to purchase a second  one. The funds will also be used to
              purchase a robotic lab station that  automates cycle sequencing reactions and
              software that analyzes complex  electrophoretic DNA patterns. Automated
              analysis and quantitation of  complex DNA electrophoretic patterns at
              nucleotide resolution is  necessary for microsatellite, ARMS PCR and SSCP
              analyses of polymorphic  loci. Expanded DNA sequencing capacity is vital to
              current studies of  DNA sequence analysis including transcriptional regulatory
              regions of  cell-specific genes, cDNA clones for transcription factors and
              their  interacting proteins and autoantibodies, verifying site-directed 
              mutations to study structure-function relationships in proteins and DNA 
              transcriptional control elements, the nucleotide basis of genetic 
              polymorphisms, chromosomal breakpoints implicated in oncogene  activation,
              analysis of extended loci of multigene families and  sequence verification of
              extended transgenes for introduction into  mice.
