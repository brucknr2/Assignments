Abstract    :
              9413065  Moehle  This is a "SGER" grant to support a team efort to recover 
              perishable data of structural damage immediately following  the January 17,
              1994 Northridge earthquake.  The effort was  made by a team conprising 50
              individuals from the Earthquake  Engineering Research Center (EERC) of
              University of  California, Berkeley.    The Reconnaisance team focused its
              effort on seismology,  geology, geotechnical engineering, and structural 
              engineering fields studies in the damaged area.  A  comprehensive report,
              containing preliminary summaries of  multi-disciplinary research finding is
              prepared and  distributed.    This report is valuable to re-evaluate research
              priorities  and to formulate research projects based on lessons learn  from
              this damaging event.  ***
