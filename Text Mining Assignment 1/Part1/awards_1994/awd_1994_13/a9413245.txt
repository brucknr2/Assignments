Abstract    :
              9413245  Seiberling    The influence of impurities (surfactants) on the
              heteroepitaxial  growth of germanium on the (100) surface of silicon will be 
              investigated.  This materials system has been chosen because it  represents a
              model strained heteroepitaxial system, about which  much is already known. 
              Surface impurities, such as H or Sb, have  been found to dramatically alter the
              morphology and structure of a  growing layer.  The transmission ion channeling
              technique will be  applied to investigate the atomic structure and composition
              of  monolayer germanium films growing on silicon in order to understand  the
              microscopic role played by the impurity atoms.    %  %  %  %    An important
              goal in materials science is to be able to build  tailor-made materials with
              specific desirable properties.  A major  step in fulfilling this goal is to
              learn how to grow high quality  crystalline layers of one material on another. 
              Perfect growth can  be inhibited by various factors, including a tendency of
              the  overlayer to form islands, the creation of defects, etc.  It has  recently
              been shown that certain impurities, often referred to as  surfactants, can have
              a dramatic effect on the structure and  properties of a growing film.  The
              mechanism by which surfactants  influence growth of germanium on silicon, an
              important  technological system, will be studied using a novel ion scattering 
              technique.  With this technique it is possible to measure the  atomic structure
              and the composition of the growing film.  ***
