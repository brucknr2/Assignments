Abstract    :
              Abstract  Goucher College - L. Bielawski   Connection to NSFNET  Proposal No. 
              NCR-9413200  Goucher College requests support from NSF for connection of their 
              campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network  located in the
              southeastern United States.  It will provide  operations management and
              information services and it will give  Goucher College a 56 thousand bits per
              second connection to the  NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
              second) National  Backbone network.    Students and faculty research will
              benefit from the link.  By  linking to the mid-level and national networks,
              Goucher College  faculty and academics will maintain a position of leadership
              in  research and educational innovation by profiting from remote access  to
              super computer centers, data bases and information services,  high speed
              communications, file transfer and remote login, and  access to library
              resources.  This is also a unique opportunity for  the school to explore
              innovative educational resources.
