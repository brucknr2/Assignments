Abstract    :
                      9413304  Hamilton  This research will investigate theoretically and
              experimentally  nonlinear effects in laser generated Rayleigh and Lamb waves. 
              A  comprehensive theoretical model for nonlinear Rayleigh wave  propagation in
              an isotropic elastic solid will be developed.  The  general theoretical
              approach will be extended to include Lamb waves  in plates.  A main focus of
              the study is identification and  description of effects that can be exploited
              in nondestructive  testing, for example, determination of the third-order
              elastic  constants that describe nonlinear effects in isotropic solids.  In 
              parallel with this work, experiments will be carried out using  laser-generated
              nonlinear Rayleigh and Lamb waves at the General  Physics Institute of Moscow.
