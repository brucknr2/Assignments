Abstract    :
              9413870   Aberbach   This award supports research in commutative algebra.  The 
              principal investigator will explore the structure of the absolute  integral
              closure of excellent local rings.  He will also study  the Cohen-Macaulayness
              of graded rings for ideals of higher  analytic deviation.  This research is
              concerned with a number of questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic
              geometry.  Algebraic geometry  studies solutions of families of polynomial
              equations.  One can  either study the geometry of the solution set or approach 
              problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the  solution set
              that form what is called a commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a
              close connection between commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.
