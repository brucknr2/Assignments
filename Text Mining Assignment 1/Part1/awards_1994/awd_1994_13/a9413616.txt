Abstract    :
              proposal# 9413616  PI - Langmuir    Current shipboard measurement of ocean CO2
              is extremely expensive and too limited in scope for accurate modelling of Ocean
              CO2 uptake/release.  This STTR  project will focus on building an
              instrument/sensor system for remote long-term measurement of total dissolved
              inorganic carbon.  These instruments my be deployed at stationary buoys or
              ocean platforms for long-term data acquisition of ocean pH and dissolved CO2.  
               These sensors will be less expensive and less subject to drift than current
              proposed fiber optic devices and currently available electrode sensors.
