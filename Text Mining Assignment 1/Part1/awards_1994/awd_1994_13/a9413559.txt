Abstract    :
              9413559  Wise  This proposal requests funding to significantly upgrade the
              equipment for producing chemical-vapor deposited (CVD) thin dielectric films at
              the University of Michigan.  Specifically, the proposal seeks funding to
              upgrade the pumping system on our existing LPCVD system for silicon nitride and
              silicon dioxide in order to overcome serious problems with down-time that have
              been experienced over the last several years.  These problems have seriously
              impeded a number of important research programs.  In addition, the proposal
              seeks funding to install a new CVD system for the deposition of low-temperature
              oxide (LTO) and phosphosilicate glass (PSG).  While these processes are basic
              and standard throughout the microelectronics industry, they have never been
              available at Michigan, seriously limiting our research capabilities and the
              types of structures that can be addressed.  The lack of these films has been a
              major factor limiting our research on surface micromachined microstructures,
              which are useful in the development of a great many integrated sensors and
              microactuators.  Specific immediate uses of the LTO/PSG system include the
              conformal chip-level encapsulation of integrated sensors for use in
              chronically-implantable neural prostheses, the development of planarized
              feedthroughs for hermetically-sealed microsystems, and application in a number
              of microsensors and microactuators for use in transportation systems and
              automated semiconductor manufacturing.  The proposed equipment directly affects
              the programs of 26 faculty and nearly 50 graduate research students at the
              University of Michigan; in addition, it will permit an expanded range of
              projects in two laboratory courses at the University and will allow structures
              such as those produced by surface micromachining to be introduced into the
              courses in a practical way.    The field of sensors, microactuators, and
              microsystems ("MEMS") us expanding on a worldwide basis and is generally
              accepted as very important to areas such as health ca re, environmental
