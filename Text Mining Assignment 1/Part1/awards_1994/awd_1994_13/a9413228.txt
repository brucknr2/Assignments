Abstract    :
              9413228  Schneider  This award renews support of a Research Training Group (RTG)
              that includes 27 faculty from 13 departments at the University of Pittsburgh
              and Carnegie Mellon University.  Most faculty are affiliated with the
              Departments of Psychology, Neurobiology, or Mathematics.  The RTG provides
              training for undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral fellows with a focus on
              understanding the role of neural processes in cognition through computational
              and experimental approaches.  Research programs of individual faculty involve
              modeling of individual nerves and other types of excitable cells,
              characterization of properties of neural networks, localization of metabolic
              activity in the brain through use of magnetic resonance imaging and other
              techniques, a variety of in vitro and in vivo physiological studies, and
              investigations of the effects of disease on cognition in humans and animals. 
              The RTG sponsors about 5 new graduate and 1-2 new postdoctoral students per
              year, and supports summer research by 3 undergraduates per year.  Trainees at
              all levels are recruited nationally.  Graduate trainees are admitted through
              one of 13 participating departmental Ph.D. programs or through an
              interdepartmental neuroscience Ph.D. program at the University of Pittsburgh. 
              Graduate training includes required and elective courses in neuroscience,
              cognition and mathematics.  A number of the courses were developed specifically
              for the RTG.  Additional training includes participation in seminars and
              workshops sponsored by the RTG, as well as individual and collaborative
              research.  ***
