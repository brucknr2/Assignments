Abstract    :
              9413160  Talley  In this project, the PI will conduct basic hydrographic
              operations  on the central Indian Ocean meridional section along 80 deg E, and 
              the eastern part of the zonal section along 33 deg S (designated  lines I8N and
              I5E respectively under the World Ocean Circulation  Experiment - WOCE).  Data
              will be used to look at inflow of deep  water into the Central Indian Basin,
              the fate of the deep water (in  conjunction with the other WHP sections), the
              meridional structure  of equatorial currents, particularly the deep ater, and
              the  vertical structure of the subtropical gyre.  I5E will be used to  measure
              the Leeuwin current and will provide a check on time  variability, when
              compared with the first occupation of this  section in 1987.
