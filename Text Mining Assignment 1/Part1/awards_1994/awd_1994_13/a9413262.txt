Abstract    :
              9413262  Govind  This project   is on research to develop a new class of 
              biosensors based on synthetic fluorophores and phase-shift  fluorometry.  The
              method uses the principle that a fluorophore  exhibits shift in its emission in
              response to the analyte in  question when excited by an intensity modulated
              beam of light.   This research will stress the development of resonance energy 
              transfer fluorophores and light sources that can be modulated at  high
              frequencies.  On-line  sensors for pH, oxygen, carbon  dioxide, and glucose
              will be developed and tested for both  hybridoma cell cultures and microbial
              fermentations.  ***
