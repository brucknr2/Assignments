Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT      Hawkins, R. Lee  AST-9413335    The PIs
              will install on the Wellesley College's 24-inch  Boller & Chivens reflector
              telescope a semi-custom Guide-  Acquire Module (GAM) that includes a
              custom-designed focal  reducer/field flattener and filter wheel.  This
              instrument  will allow virtually instantaneous instrument selection  between
              the on-axis beam and 4 radial instrument ports; to  upgrade the secondary
              cell/focus housing so that it will be  both more repeatable and rigid than the
              current set up; to  acquire a Tektronix 1024x1024 thinned, back-side
              illuminated  CCD system to increase the field size by factor of roughly  2.5
              and the quantum efficiency by a factor of roughly 2.0;  and to install active
              and passive dome ventilation in order  to equilibrate the temperature of the
              dome structure more  quickly, to help minimize the effects of dome seeing. 
              Finally, the PIs will acquire two large hard disks drives  for their
              workstation in order to deal with the larger  images with the larger CCD.   
              Because these problems are not unique to Wellesley, the PIs  plan to publish
              the results of this project in detailed,  comprehensive review article on
              retrofitting CCDs to small  telescopes.    The resulting telescope improvement,
              will gently enhance the  research and educational capability of the Wellesley
              College  Observatory.  ***
