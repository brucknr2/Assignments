Abstract    :
              INT 9413469  Michl    The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech research project
              between  Dr. Josef Michl of the University of Colorado, Boudler, and Dr. 
              Ctibor Mazal of Masaryk University, is to extend work on assembly  of
              supramolecular structures.  On the synthetic side, laterally  functionalized
              rods are needed.  The researchers consider bridge-  substituted (n)staffanes
              ideal; however their preparation  requires more exploratory synthetic work on
              novel structures.   The Czech participants will address this need by drawing
              upon  their experience in classical organic synthesis to prepare small-  ring
              compounds.  Characterization of these molecules will be made  by the U.S.
              participants.  Results should contribute important,  useful units to a
              molecular-size construction set for  supramolecular products, being developed
              at the University of  Colorado.    This chemistry project in organic dynamics
              fulfills the program  objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              leading  experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine 
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of  strong mutual
              interest and competence.
