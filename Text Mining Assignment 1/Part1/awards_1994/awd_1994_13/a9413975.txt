Abstract    :
                This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of Kansas acquire an
              upgrade of Mass Spectrometry  which will be used in research.  The research
              activity to be supported includes conducting a  wide variety of fundamental
              research in the chemistry of proteins, peptides,  oligonucleotides, and
              synthetic macromolecules.    Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to
              probe intimate structural details and to obtain  the molecular compositions of
              a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules.   The
              addition of the technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein
              and nucleic acid  molecular weights far beyond any other technique.  The use of
              electrospray ionization in  combination with high resolution provides the
              latest techniques available in mass spectrometry.   It affords the chemist one
              of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of  compounds. 
              The acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the 
              prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
