Abstract    :
              9413109  Danyluk    This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              (I/UCRC) is  being funded as a multi-site research Center.  Northwestern 
              University is adding the Georgia Institute of Technology as a  research site in
              the I/UCRC for  Engineering Tribology research.   Four companies are joining
              the Center with the Georgia Institute of  Technology becoming an additional
              research site in the Center.    The joint operation will add research
              activities on  modelling of  mechanical seals, investigation of hydrodynamic 
              film forming  capability of various liquids, and the optimization of the dicing
               of silicon wafers to the existing research activities and attract  more
              companies to joint the Center.    The researchers involved with the Centers are
              well qualified to  perform the research projects.    The Program manager
              recommends the Georgia Insitute of Technology  be awarded $50,000 for the first
              year of a five year continuing  award.    Near the end of each 12-month period,
              the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education
              and Center's  Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of 
              renewal criteria, including the following: 1) the extent to which  the
              industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the
              support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research
              program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager
              will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
