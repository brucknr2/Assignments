Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of California--Santa
              Barbara in the purchase of  Nd:YAG pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO)
              as sources of high-brightness, high-  resolution tunable radiation.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas  including the following: 
              (a)  Electron Affinity of Carbon and Other Interesting Clusters; (b)  
              Photochemical Properties of Transition Metal Complexes;  (c)  Spectroscopic
              Studies of M+-  H2 Complexes (M=Ca, Sr, and Ba); and (d)  Surface Chemistry of
              State-Selected,  Vibrationally Excited Molecules.    A tunable infrared laser
              can provide important information about chemical reactivity.  Its use  may
              enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and
              nonreactive of  molecules.
