Abstract    :
              9413158  Top  In this project, the PI will collect and analyze samples for 
              Helium-  3 and Tritium on WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) sections, I-1 
              (10degN), I-7N (Arabian Sea), and I-9N (95degE and Bay of Bengal),  as part of
              the WOCE Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE).  The objective  is to describe and
              quantify the strength of the thermohaline  circulation, using the water mass
              isolation age information  inherent in the He/Tr distributions, and to evaluate
              the extent of  ventilation.
