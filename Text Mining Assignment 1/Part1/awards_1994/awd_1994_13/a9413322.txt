Abstract    :
              9413322 Hwang  This project seeks to achieve an understanding of  the
              relationship between kinetic roughening and native defect  formation in
              wide-gap II-VI semiconductors.  Kinetic roughening  results from the stochastic
              nature of the growth process and may  lead to loss of control over surface
              stoichiometry.  Research  towards the construction of a kinetic phase diagram
              that correlates  the degree of roughening and growth parameters will be
              conducted.   Such a diagram allows various growth conditions to be 
              systematically explored so that optimal growth parameters can be  identified. 
              The application of statistical physics and surface  physics to the study of
              defect formation is expected to provide new  insight into the issue of dopant
              compensation as well as the  kinetic processes on growing surfaces. %%% This
              project addresses  the issue of dopant compensation in wide-gap II-VI
              semiconductors  from a surface physics point of view.  The goal of the research
              is  to establish a relationship between kinetic roughening and dopant 
              incorporation for a class of materials that are being employed to   develop
              blue semiconductor lasers.  Currently, doping control  remains to be the main
              challenge, and it is expected that the  results of this research will have an
              impact on the fabrication of  these devices, and will contribute to improving
              the general  perform ance of advanced devices and integrated circuits used in 
              computing, information processing, and tele communica tions.
