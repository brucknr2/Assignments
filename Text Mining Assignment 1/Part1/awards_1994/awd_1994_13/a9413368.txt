Abstract    :
              CTS-9413368    High gradient magnetic separations (HGMS) technique will be to
              collect and separate nanometer size particles.  Magnetic properties allow the
              small particles to be subjected to a large driving force for separation.  The
              mechanism of separation of nanoparticles will be investigated for different
              flow conditions using a range of magnetic fields.  The dynamics of particle
              collection will be studied in both liquid and air media.  The research may lead
              to an improved understanding of the behavior and interactions of small
              particles in magnetic fields.  The research will also provide training to
              students in the important interdisciplinary area of ultrafine particle
              processing.  Development of the proposed separation technique could have impact
              on pollution control and biotechnology, and also lead to the development of
              novel nanostructured materials.
