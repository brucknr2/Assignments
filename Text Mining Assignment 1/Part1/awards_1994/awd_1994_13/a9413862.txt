Abstract    :
              9413862  Shridhar     The research instrumentation along with the existing
              facility will support both basic and applied research in three-dimensional
              computer vision, pattern recognition, dynamic scene analysis, machine vision,
              intelligent systems, and parallel architecture for real-time implementation.
              Specifically, the research activities that will benefit from the acquired
              instrumentation include parallel processing for machine  vision applications
              involving 3-d image processing, handwritten address recognition on mail pieces,
              document analysis and interpretation, 3-d image segmentation, medical image
              analysis, glass inspection, analysis of shattered glass for automotive
              applications, design of image processing  hardware for morphological
              processing, lanes/road/automobile detection in visual/infra-red/millimeter wave
              images and compression of digital images  and videos.       The instrumentation
              requested in this proposal falls into two categories, namely, those pertaining
              to image data acquisition and display, and those pertaining to computing. The
              image equipment consists of a video camera, digitizer, frame grabber, and
              recording media. The computing equipment consists of high performance
              workstations.  ***
