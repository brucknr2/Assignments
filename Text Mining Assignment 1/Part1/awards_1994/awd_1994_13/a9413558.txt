Abstract    :
              9413558  Schwab  This is an award to provide support for purchase of equipment
              to  be used in conducting research on the fate and transport of  organic
              compounds of pollutional significance in the environment.  Projects in which
              the equipment will be used include the  feasibility of using plants to
              accelerate the dissipation of  potentially toxic contaminants in the
              environment, especially in  soil.  A major use will be in the study of
              vegetation-mediated  removal of polycyclic and aliphatic hydrocarbons from
              petroleum  contaminated soils.    This proposal was submitted in response to
              the Instrumentation  Development and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 93-172,
              Academic  Research Infrastructure Program.  Results of this award are  expected
              to improve the accessibility of modern research  instrumentation for use by
              this institution's faculty in  educating students and in conducting research on
              important topics  of environmental significance.  ***
