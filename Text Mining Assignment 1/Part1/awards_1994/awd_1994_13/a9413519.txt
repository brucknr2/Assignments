Abstract    :
                                     ABSTRACT         We are requesting funding for a Becton
              Dickinson  FACsort.  There are three main objectives for the  acquisition of
              this instrument.  1) The FACsort will be used  extensively in ongoing studies
              on lymphocyte  differentiation.  These projects involve 6 to 8  undergraduate
              students every term, including the summer.  2)  The FACSort will be an integral
              part of the undergraduate  Immunology course.  3) Experiments using the FACSort
              will be  introduced into the Molecular Biology course.  Thus, a large  number
              of undergraduates will gain experience with the  fluorescence activated cell
              sorting through both  undergraduate courses and research experience.       Two
              research projects at Occidental College require  cell sorting.  Dr. Pollock's
              research centers on somatic  mutation of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V)
              region genes.  Somatic mutation plays an important role in generating  antibody
              diversity.  We are developing an assay to detect  and isolate lymphocytes
              undergoing somatic mutation of  immunoglobulin genes.  The assay uses a DNA
              construct  encoding a fusion protein composed of a rearranged V gene, 
              containing a stop codon, linked to a lacZ reporter gene.  If  somatic mutation
              reverts the stop codon, the entire fusion  protein is translated and lacZ
              expressed.  LacZ expression  is readily detected by fluorescence assays.  This
              construct  is being used in cell lines and to make transgenic mice.  These mice
              will be used to ask: 1) where can somatic  mutation be detected; 2) when is
              somatic mutation seen after  immunization; 3) when does somatic mutation first
              occur  during ontogeny; 4) which germinal center cells show active  somatic
              mutation; and 5) what is the phenotype of cells  undergoing somatic mutation.
