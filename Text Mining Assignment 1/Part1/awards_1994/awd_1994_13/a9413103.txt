Abstract    :
              9413103  Crumpton       This research addresses the problem of work place
              redesign to  accommodate the needs of disabled persons.  The objective of the 
              research is to undertake a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility  of using a
              comprehensive design methodology to redesign workplaces  to accommodate the
              needs of the physically challenged person.   Should the results from the
              preliminary study show some promise, a  more detailed and comprehensive
              investigation will be undertaken.   The ultimate aim is to develop tools which
              can be used in the  workplaces that clearly recognize the needs of the disabled
               persons.         The outcome of the research has immediate applications.  It 
              can be used to design workplaces that ensure efficiency and safety  not just
              for the disabled but for the general workforce.  The  results are also useful
              for developing solutions to implement  workplace, equipment and job changes. 
              Through this type of  research, workplace data necessary to obtain better
              understanding  of the needs of the physically impaired persons at workplaces
              can  be generated.
