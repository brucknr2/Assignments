Abstract    :
              9413102  McWilliams       This award provides partial funding for the
              acquisition  of a high-mass resolution, high-transmission ion microprobe  that
              will be installed and operated in the School of Earth  Sciences at Stanford
              University. Stanford University is  committed to providing the remaining funds
              needed for the  acquisition of the instrument.       The ion microprobe will be
              used primarily in research  projects in isotope geochemistry, cosmochemistry, 
              geochronology, and materials science. The facility will be  open to scientists
              from Stanford University, the U.S.  Geological survey, and other research
              institutions. The new  design ion microprobe will be capable of quantitative in
               situ measurements of isotopic and elemental  compositions of  geological
              materials with micron scale spatial resolution in  three dimensions and high
              sensitivity.  ***  9406684  Johnson       This award provides partial funding
              for the support of  a technician assigned to the Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory 
              in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the  University of Wisconsin,
              Madison. The technician will assist  in the operation and maintenance of the
              laboratory's  equipment that includes a multicollector thermal ionization  mass
              spectrometer and associated instrumentation for sample  preparation and data
              analysis. The laboratory is a resource  for mass spectrometric analysis needed
              in research and  teaching projects in the earth sciences by a large number of 
              researchers on-campus and off-campus. Research applications  include work on
              Arctic Ocean sediments, mantle geochemistry,  volcanism, geochronology of
              carbonates in the Michigan Basin  and Wisconsin Arch provinces, and Archean and
              Proterozoic  granites. The technician will also participate in the  technical
              developmental work of the laboratory, including  the development of new methods
              for the quantitative  measurement of the isotopes of hafnium.  ***
