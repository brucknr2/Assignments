Abstract    :
              9413017  Serio   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is to support
              continued research on development of  a flue gas monitoring system for
              determination of the potential  air contaminants in emissions of gases from
              combustion processes.  The system is based on the application of principles
              derived from  the use Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in monitoring 
              nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine in an on-line, diagnostic  instrument that can be
              used for the determination of the  composition of effluent gas streams.  The
              proposal leading to  this recommendation results from successful completion of
              a Phase  I, Small Business Innovation Research project in which the technical
              feasibility of the  concept proposed was demonstrated.  In Phase II, the
              investigator  plans on assembling a working field prototype and to validate its
               precision, accuracy and stability during operation in full-scale  combustion
              systems as a step toward determination of the  concept's commercial
              feasibility.   Exhaust gases from combustion of fossil fuels and from
              combustion  of solid wastes results in the production of byproduct gases that 
              pollute air into which they are discharged.  Results of this  project are
              expected to determine the commercial feasibility of  producing an instrument
              that could be used to monitor nitrogen  and sulfur oxides and potentially toxic
              gases in the exhausts  from combustion processes.
