Abstract    :
              Theoretical studies will be carried out in the theory of  gravitation where
              general relativity, statistical mechanics,  and quantum theory meet.  The
              principal effort will be to  construct a statistical mechanics foundation for
              gravitation  that can also include all other matter fields.  From this 
              mechanics, the thermodynamics of black holes and horizons  will be deduced and
              their fluctuations calculated.  Emphasis  will be on a consistent formulation
              of quantum field theory  in curved spacetime, and the back reaction of these
              fields  on spacetime geometry, including study of structures of  possible
              importance in early cosmology, as well as black  holes and cosmological event
              horizons.  The aim ultimately  is to develop the statistical mechanics
              framework as a  paradigm for all dynamical processes; therefore, formulation 
              of the description of irreversible processes in the  developing framework will
              be carried out.    This classical problem has applications in numerical 
              relativity and astrophysics.  It is expected to contribute  insights which will
              be valuable in the search for a correct  quantum theory of gravitation.
