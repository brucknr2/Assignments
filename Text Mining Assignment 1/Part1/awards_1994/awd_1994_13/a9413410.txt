Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    We request funds to purchase a mass spectrometer for stable 
              isotope studies using 13C and  lSN. The Europa 20/20 instrument combines a high
              precision  mass spectrometer with a gas  chromatograph-thermal conductivity
              detector and automated  sample inlet system that permits  analysis of 66
              samples for both mass and isotopic  composition. The instrument would 
              eliminate the use of 14C, a radioactive isotope, for ongoing  time-series
              measurements of  primary production and so free us from the high costs of 
              disposal from a remote oceanic site.  In addition, it would permit concurrent
              analysis of both  primary production and nitrogen  cycling. The new instrument
              would replace our current  instrument for 15N analysis, an  emission
              spectrometer, to provide increased sensitivity and  automated sample
              preparation.  Savings would also accrue from measuring the sample mass  (carbon
              & nitrogen) and isotope  composition on a single sample rather than from
              multiple  samples and separate analyses as  is currently required. Our existing
              courses to train foreign  scientists in established methods  for global change
              research would be modified to include  instruction in stable isotope 
              techniques.
