Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project will
              focus on an analytical technique capable of simultaneous, trace, multi-element
              determinations on small samples of biological materials at a reasonable cost. 
              The proposed research will develop a unique capacitively coupled microwave
              plasma (CCMP) emission spectrometer system for this purpose.  The system will
              utilize a novel, commercially available , high resolution, large spectral
              range, large throughput, small image format echelle spectrometer with a charge
              coupled device detector.  This detection system will provide more than 1
              million spectral resolution elements over the range 170-900 nm.  For the
              multi-element analysis of microsamples, the analytical figured of merit as well
              as the cost and simplicity of the proposed systems, will exceed any other
              commercial or research instrumentation.
