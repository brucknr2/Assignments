Abstract    :
                          9413485  McDermott  This is a starter grant for an NSF Postdoctoral
              Research Fellow in  Plant Biology.  The long-term objective of the research is
              to  understand the role of phosphorus (P) in the Rhizobium-legume  symbiosis.  
               The research plan is divided into three general goals, and is  designed to
              carry on from where the postdoctoral research stopped.   The first goal is to
              determine what factors influence bacteroid P  supply or bacteriod P acquisition
              activities during symbiosis.   This includes determining to what extent host
              genotype or growth  stage can influence bacteroid P supply and if aspects of
              nodule  ecology can affect bacteroid regulatory mechanisms.  The second  goal
              involves looking at the importance of various possible sources  of P during
              symbiosis.  This will be achieved by isolating  Rhizobium mutants with defects
              in the different mechanisms of P  acquisition, and testing them for a symbiosis
              phenotype.  The third  goal is to begin cloning the genes involved in P
              metabolic  regulation so that we can begin to understand how and to what 
              extent enviornmental P can influence all aspects of symbiosis.    The above
              research represents a comprehensive and directed attempt  at understanding P
              metabolism in (Brady)Rhizobium.  It blends  physiology, molecular biology, and
              biochemistry in a way that  should quickly provide important information about
              a macronutrient  that, on a world-wide basis, is known to be limiting for this 
              ecomonically important symbiosis.  ***
