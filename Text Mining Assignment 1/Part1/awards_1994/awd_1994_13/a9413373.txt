Abstract    :
              A state-of-the-art multi-processor computer  (CONVEX SPP-1000/16) would be
              acquired with the Academic Research Infrastructure Program funds. The present
              4-processor machine would be replaced with the CONVEX 16 processor machine. The
              new machine would be utilized for problems ranging from basic and fundamental
              problems to finite element modeling in materials processing and the design of
              new materials using computer simulations. The research topics include the
              modeling of extended lattice defects; modeling of the mechanics of interfaces,
              plastic constitutive properties and fracture; modeling of complex materials
              such as multimolecular assemblies, pure and doped fullerenes and metal-ammonia
              systems; vibrational relaxation on surfaces and simulation of
              semiconductor/water interfaces. The faculty associated with these research
              projects have excellent links with industry. The research group has a Research
              Partnership with the CONVEX Corporation.  A state-of-the-art 16 parallel
              processer computer will be employed in a wide range of materials problems
              ranging from fundamental problems such as charge transport in complex materials
              such as fullerenes and metal-ammonia solutions to paractical problems involving
              the mechanics of interfaces, plastic constitutive properties and fracture and
              the chemical stability of liquid-semiconductor interfaces.
