Abstract    :
              9413824  Rittmann  This is a grant to support research the objective of which is
              to  determine conditions under which monooxygenation reactions of  secondary
              substrates can be accelerated while achieving other  process goals in stable,
              suspended growth biological reactors  that are used to treat contaminated 
              wastewaters, leachates from  landfills and groundwaters contaminated by
              chlorinated aliphatic  and aromatic organic substances.  The specific
              substrates the  investigator plans on studying in this project are
              4-chlorophenol  and 2,4 dinitrophenol.  A two stage process will be used in
              which  the first reactor will be used to enrich the cells with the  reduced
              electron-carrier and the second stage used to ensure  removal of substances
              capable of biochemically exerting a demand  for oxygen, to control growth of
              biomass and to provide adequate  retention time for the biologically active
              solids.      Aromatic hydrocarbons of petroleum origin, chlorinated aliphatic 
              solvents and the nitroaromatics are the most commonly detected  organic
              contaminants of water in the United States.  Biological  degradation of these
              compounds is an especially promising  approach because, if successful,
              degradation is complete and  likely to be economically viable under conditions
              that are not  extreme regarding the physical conditions under which degradation
               takes place.  Results of this project are expected to improve the  design of
              biological reactors as they are used in environmental  engineering practice.
