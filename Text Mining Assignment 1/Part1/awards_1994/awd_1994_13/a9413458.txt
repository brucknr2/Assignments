Abstract    :
              9413458  Lempp       The Southern Wisconsin Logic Colloquium, now in its fifth 
              year, continues to be one of the largest regional logic seminars  in the
              country, meeting every other week for one or two talks and  attracting an
              average of twenty or thirty faculty and graduate  students from the University
              of Wisconsin-Madison, Marquette  University (Milwaukee), the University of
              Wisconsin-Parkside  (Kenosha), and the University of Wisconsin Center-Rock
              County  (Janesville).  Talks represent the whole spectrum of logic,  including
              all areas of mathematical logic and logic applied in  computer science,
              linguistics, and industry.  ***
