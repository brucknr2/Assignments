Abstract    :
              9413299  Garvine    This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research
              in coastal  oceanography between two research teams led by Richard W. Garvine,
              University of  Delaware, and A.E. Hill at the School of Ocean Sciences,
              University of Wales.  The  objective of the research is to directly observe,
              using free-drifting buoys, the flow  regime of baroclinic gyres (or spirals) in
              shelf seas which form in spring/summer  each year. These gyres are produced in
              topographical depressions by differing  amounts of tidal mixing between the
              shallow edges and deep center of the  depressions.  Though a newly discovered
              phenomenon, seasonal baroclinic gyres  appear to have important ecological
              consequences for dispersal of contaminants in  coastal waters, on retention of
              planktonic larvae, and on the nature of shelf sea  circulation.    The
              researchers will conduct joint field observations of seasonal baroclinic gyres
              off  the coast of Scotland and then apply a series of modeling studies to the 
              observational data.  The United Kingdom will provide ship time on the research 
              vessel RRS Challenger.  By combining the modeling capabilities and
              observational  resources of the two research groups, especially in
              satellite-tracked drifters, the  researchers will obtain optimal coverage and
              resolution of shelf sea circulation.
