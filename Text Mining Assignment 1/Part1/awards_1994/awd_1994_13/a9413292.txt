Abstract    :
              The response of the tropical and equatorial ocean turbulent boundary layer
              system to unsteady atmospheric forcing on time scales from doiurnal to annual
              will be studied using a variety of numerical models. The surface layer mixing
              paramerization will be used to explain the transition from an eastern and
              central Pacific system to that of the western Pacific warm pool, reallistically
              responding to differences in localand advective forcing regimes. This study is
              a contribution to the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere
              Reponse Experiment (TOGA COARE).
