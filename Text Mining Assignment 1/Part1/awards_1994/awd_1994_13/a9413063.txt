Abstract    :
              Professor Salisbury and his students will continue their  research into computer
              solutions to the complex equations of  gravitation describing the behavior of
              gravitational waves.  He will emphasize studies of colliding plane waves using
              the  new formalism of Ashtekar for computation, and will initiate  other
              studies of both vacuum space-times, and ones with  material sources.  The
              ultimate objective of this program is to develop  powerful numerical techniques
              to study the generation of  gravitational waves from astronomical sources.
