Abstract    :
              9413211  Oakley  This award renews support of a joint training effort of 15
              faculty from six departments in the Schools of Arts and Sciences, of Medicine
              and of Dentistry at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  The theme of this
              Research Training Group (RTG) is developmental neurobiology.  Faculty and
              student research emphasize three aspects of the development of the nervous
              system: neurogenesis, axonal navigation, and synaptogenesis.  The research
              addresses these issues in a variety of organisms, including invertebrates,
              fish, birds and mammals using a variety of techniques from cell and molecular
              biology.    The RTG sponsors training at all three post-secondary levels. 
              Besides opportunities for student research, RTG faculty have created new
              courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Graduate students are
              selected from students who apply to one of two departmental Ph.D. programs or
              an interdepartmental Neuroscience Ph.D. program, and receive support for up to
              three years.  Postdoctoral fellows are selected for one year of support from
              among candidates proposed by participating faculty.  Undergraduates are
              sponsored during both the academic year and summer term.  Participants in the
              summer research program are recruited nationally.  The level of involvement of
              undergraduates in the RTG is particularly noteworthy; over 80 such students
              carried out research under the auspices of the RTG during its first four years.
