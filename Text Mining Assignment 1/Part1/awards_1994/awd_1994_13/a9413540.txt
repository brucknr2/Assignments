Abstract    :
                   This is a study of the transition of the People's Republic of China from a
              command economy to a market-oriented economy, focusing on the birth of a civil
              society that can form the basis of later democratization and on the ways that
              these massive changes affect the life pathways and life chances of individuals.
              The project will collect and analyze 3,000 retrospective life histories of a
              stratified representative sample of urban residents.  It will examine the
              impacts of the distinctive mechanisms of stratification in state socialist
              redistributive systems: 1) the hierarchical order of occupations and
              organizations, and 2) political changes, including political campaigns and
              sudden, sharp shifts in state policy.  The dynamics of stratification will be
              modeled using an event history framework.  In addition, the study will examine
              new stratifying mechanisms introduced as part of the economic reforms of recent
              years.  %%%   This research will contribute to scientific understanding of the
              interplay between state policies and the life course, providing insights for
              comparative analysis of stratification systems.  Research on the most populous
              nation, that has chosen to undertake radical evolution toward market economy
              while holding back political democratization, will contribute greatly to the
              knowledge base on which policy makers can base their decisions.
