Abstract    :
              Abstract - Suib - 9413394      This research involves the use of microwave
              heating in the presence and absence of catalysts for conversion of methane into
              higher hydrocarbons via oligomerization reactions.  In addition,
              microwave-induced heating of precursors of manganese oxide sols and gels will
              be used to prepare highly dispersed microporous manganese oxides that will be
              used as oligomerization catalysts.  Optimization of reactor types, modes of
              operation (contact times, pulse versus continuous), and addition of dielectrics
              will be done to optimize conversion and selectivity.  In situ characterization
              methods will be developed to monitor the mechanisms of reaction.    The goals
              of the project are to prepare microporous manganese dioxide (MnO2)
              Microwave-Induced Oligomerization (MIO) catalysts, to study MIO of methane to
              higher hydrocarbons, to elucidate mechanistic details of MIO reactions, and to
              study fundamental aspects of reactor configurations, additives (chain
              propagators, dielectrics), temperature measurements, magnetic field effects,
              and reaction conditions.  All reactions will be done in a flow system. 
              Characterization studies will involve product analyses by gas chromatography
              mas spectrometry methods, microwave-induced acoustic studies of heat and energy
              transfer in such systems, and Fourier transform infrared studies of hydrocarbon
              intermediates and products.  The long-term goal is to understand factors which
              control product selectivity and long-term stability of microwave-induced
              reactions.
