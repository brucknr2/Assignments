Abstract    :
              proposal# 9413565  PI - Akse    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
              Phase I research project is concerned with the consequences of long term human
              exposure to elemental chlorine and chlorine containing organic compounds which
              is an issue of increasing public concern.  Chlorine in the environment has been
              associated with such disparate phenomena as carcinogenesis, reductions in human
              sperm count, and increased fragility of egg shells in endangered avian species.
               More stringent regulation of the release into the environment of chlorinated
              species is anticipated.  A major source of long term, low level exposure to
              chlorocarbons is through the public drinking water supplies.  The most
              significant means of minimizing the associated health risks is the reduction of
              those chlorinated by-products caused by excess chlorination.  This requires a
              continuous and detailed knowledge of chlorine levels throughout the drinking
              water distribution system so that more precise control of chlorine additions
              can be made.  Such control will maintain antimicrobial activity while reducing
              unwanted disinfection by- products.    This research project has commercial
              potential in the monitoring of chlorine levels on a continuous basis in
              drinking water systems.
