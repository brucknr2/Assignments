Abstract    :
              Dr. Fine is continuing his research into the development of lower probability
              based on models for frequentist phenomena and is continuing to explore the
              implications of such models, particularly as they contrast with analyses of
              such phenomena by conventional probability.  His previous research allowed him
              to break a bond between convergence of relative frequencies and hypotheses of
              stationarity.  An example of a stationarity hypothesis is the common assumption
              in analysis of  frequentist phenomena of successive trials being independent
              and identically distributed.      In this new research, Dr. Fine is examining
              some forms of evidence that would lead to the adoption of lower probability
              models; continuing to develop an ability to construct lower probability models
              to conform with the evidence; and strengthening the calculus by adoption and
              study of an appropriate notion of lower expectation.  Lower expectation can
              provide entry to associated concepts of conditioning and independence and to
              the rudiments of statistical decision theory.  It is hoped that this research
              will encourage the broadening of the scope of probabilistic reasoning by
              exploring alternatives to conventional probability with some of the vigor with
              which the various interpretations of probability have been discussed.
