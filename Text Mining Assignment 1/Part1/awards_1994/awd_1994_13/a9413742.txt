Abstract    :
              The development of a unique facility for the study of the  magnetic and
              tribological properties of thin films will be  accomplished with funds from the
              Academic Research Infrastructure  Program. An existing apparatus donated by the
              IBM Corporation to  Rice University already includes scanning electron
              microscopy  (SEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and electron dispersive 
              X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in a large ultra-high-vacumn chamber.  Magnetic
              studies will be performed with the addition of electron  spin polarimeters to
              perform scanning electron microscopy with  polarization analysis (SEMPA) and a
              magneto-optic Kerr effect  apparatus (MOKE). The completed system will be
              uniquely equipped  to answer scientific and technological questions because of
              its  ability to: 1) image written magnetic domain structures in  magnetic data
              storage materials, 2) investigate the interaction  of written domain walls with
              microstructural features, 3) image  domain walls at surfaces of epitaxial
              evaporated films, 4) permit  fundamental studies of spin polarization at
              surfaces of epitaxial  thin films, 5) characterize the surface chemistry and
              morphology  of tribological surfaces for magnetic disk storage, 6) chemically 
              and physically characterize new tribological materials, 7)  sputter deposit and
              characterize magnetic thin films and  multilayers relevant to magnetic storage
              applications.    Starting with an existing ultra-high-vacumn chamber with
              existing  various electron spectroscopies instrumentation will be added to 
              permit magnetic measurements of magnetic thin films and magnetic  multilayer
              systems. The new facility, with a unique combination  of experimental
              capabilities, will be used to study directly the  magnetic and tribological
              properties of magnetic data storage  materials and epitaxial magnetic
              multilayer materials.
