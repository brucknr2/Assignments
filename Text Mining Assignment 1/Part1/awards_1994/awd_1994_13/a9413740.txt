Abstract    :
              With funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program a  field emission
              gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) will  be acquired for the study of
              polymers, ceramics, and biological  materials.  The facility will include
              energy dispersive X-ray  spectroscopy (EDS) which will provide a substantial
              improvement  in the detection of light elements (boron through fluorine)  which
              is very important for the materials being studied. It  will also include an ion
              beam coater to produce ultrathin  chromium coatings for high resolution imaging
              of nonconducting  materials. Research topics under investigation include:  1) 
              bioengineered proteins and bioceramics; 2) aqueous processing  of biopolymers;
              3) bioceramic plant products; 4) polymer  surface studies; 5) block copolymer
              surfaces; 6) assembly of  polymers at interfaces; 7) fracture resistance of
              fiber-  reinforced polymer blends; 8) carbon black reinforcement of  rubber; 9)
              embrittlement of nylons by salt; 10) gelation  crystallization of polymers from
              supercritical solutions; 11)  microstructural effects in high tempereature
              crack growth in  ceramics; 12) shock and thermal history of iron and chronditic
               meteorites.    A field emission gun scanning electron microscope will be 
              acquired for the study of polymers, ceramics, and biological  materials. The
              research involves a diverse range of studies of  polymer and ceramics,
              including bioceramics, and biomolecular  materials. The work includes studies
              of silk films and wood  infused with ceramics and has many potential
              applications.
