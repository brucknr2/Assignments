Abstract    :
              9413297  Ettema    A three-day Colloquium entitled "Issues and Direction in
              Hydraulics" will be held at the University of Iowa from May 21-24, 1995.  The
              colloquium seeks to focus on the major issues confronting the advancement of
              hydraulics education and practice.  This Colloquium, which will come
              approximately two years after the major Midwester floos of 1993, seeks to
              provide a clear delineation of current and near-future directions for
              hydraulics in light of the infrastruture needs of the country.  Withe the
              emergence of many new tools for research in hydrauclics as well as the desire
              to move it into different directions (closer to hydrology, more focus on
              environmental issues), it is timely to assess progress in major areas of
              hydraulics.  ***
