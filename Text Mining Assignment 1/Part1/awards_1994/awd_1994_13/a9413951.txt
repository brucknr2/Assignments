Abstract    :
              The Academic Research Infrastructure Program funds will be  used to acquire a
              helium liquifier system, a bulk liquid  nitrogen storage con-tainer and bulk
              high pressure gaseous  helium containers. These acquisitions will form the
              basis  for a highly efficient, helium recycling, cryogenic facility  serving a
              multidisciplinary scientific and engineering  community at SUNYBuffalo. The
              facility will provide services  to faculty and graduate students in 8 academic
              departments  in addition to 2 research centers, namely the Center for 
              Electronic and Electrooptic Materials and the New York State  Institute for
              Superconductivity. The facility should provide  cryogenic liquids in a more
              convenient and economical manner  to the users of cryogenic liquids. The
              principal users from  the Department of Physics are involved in research on:
              the  superconductivity of quasi-1D-metals;  two-dimensional  3Helium on the
              surface of 4Helium films; D- ions and many  electron effects on hydrogenic
              donors in gallium arsenide  quantum wells at high magnetic fields; the study of
              II-VI  magnetic semiconductor based structures and quantum wells;  transport
              and magnetic properties of high critical  temperature superconductors; high
              pressure studies in  epitaxial and bulk semiconductors.    A helium liquifier
              system with efficient helium recycling  will be developed for the users of
              liquid helium that will  increase the convenience of liquid helium use in
              addition to  reducing the cost of liquid helium. The facility will be  used by
              faculty and students from eight departments and two  Centers. The facility will
              support research in the the areas  of superconductivity and semiconductor
              heterostructures and  quantum wells.
