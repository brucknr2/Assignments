Abstract    :
              9413693  Rumble       This award provides one-half the funding for the 
              acquisition of the components needed to build an ultra-  violet laser
              microprobe for the analysis of oxygen isotope  ratios in silicate and oxide
              minerals. The laser microprobe  will be designed, built, installed, and
              operated in the  Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of 
              Washington. The Carnegie Institution of Washington is  committed to providing
              the remaining funds necessary to  complete the project. The development of the
              laser  microprobe system for in situ microanalysis of oxygen  isotope
              concentrations is expected to make a large impact in  the interpretation of
              stable isotope variations in  geological systems by allowing the measurement of
              isotopic  variations to be made with a spatial resolution of several 
              micrometers, comparable to the scale on which mineral  samples preserve the
              isotopic zoning inherited during  growth.  ***
