Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT                                              
                                 AST-9413847  Mateo, Mario    The PIs will build a
              high-efficiency, multi-object fiber-fed  echelle spectrograph for the Hiltner
              2.4m telescope at  Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT observatory.  The design will 
              optimize resolution, compactness, and allow for easy changes  of echelle
              grating/cross disperser combinations, and form  direct mode (single objects) to
              fiber mode (multiple objects  ).  The capabilities and versatility of this
              instrument will  significantly enhance the research capabilities of the 
              Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) Observatory and make the 2.4  telescope
              competitive with far larger telescopes for certain  observational problems.   
              Detailed studies in a  number of areas of fundamental  astronomical importance
              will be undertaken by the large  community of MDM astronomers.  These projects
              include; a)  studies of the dark matter content of dwarf galaxies in the  Local
              Group and beyond, b) detailed measurements of the  temporal evolution of key
              elements in disk and halo stars,  c) direct measurements of the kinematics of
              gas in the halos  of our Galaxy and external spirals, d) observations of the 
              detailed kinematical properties of supernova and nova shells  in our Galaxy and
              in external systems, e) definitive studies  of the kinematics of star clusters
              including the first  direct attempts to measure the degree of equipartition in 
              clusters, f) systematically monitoring stars in open and  globular clusters to
              search for spectroscopic binaries, g)  measurements of the distance to the
              Galactic Center via  precise kinematics observations of Cepheids along the
              solar  circle, and h) probing the physical conditions and chemical  composition
              of the diffuse interstellar medium in our  Galaxy.  The variety of topics
              underscores the scientific  community that will use the new spectrograph and
              the  versatility of the instrument itself.  ***
