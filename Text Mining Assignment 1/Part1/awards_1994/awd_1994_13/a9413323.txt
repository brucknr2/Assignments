Abstract    :
              9413323  Smith  This project will plan, organize, and conduct research to
              address  the requirements of the North American Free Trade Agreement as that 
              Agreement relates to the practice of engineering in the US, Mexico,  and
              Canada.  The focus of the project is on the Development of  Professional
              Standards for Professional Services set forth in Annex  1210.5 of Chapter 12 of
              the Agreement, involving professional  conduct and ethics.  Its goal is to
              develop recommendations on  muturally acceptable standards and criteria on
              professional conduct  and ethics for consideration by the NAFTA Forum on
              Engineering  Practice and other appropriate groups within the three nations.  
              The recommendations will include fundamental understandings of the 
              responsibilities of engineers to clients, governments and public.   This effort
              involves a team of six, two from each nation, advised  by four consultants with
              expertise in global ethics.  The project  involves several meetings and interim
              research between May and  August 1994, in order to identify major issues on
              ethics and  professional conduct, draft ideas on how they should be addressed, 
               develop a preliminary report to the NAFTA Forum on Engineering  Practice
              meeting in June, and a final list and preliminary outline  of recommendations
              for the next NAFTA meeting which is likely to  occur in the Fall in Canada. 
              After this, a final report will be  prepared and distributed appropriately. 
              Addressing these issues of  professional conduct and ethics is critical to the
              implementation  of a viable Agreement that will be beneficial to all three
              nations  in our future involvements in professional engineering practice.  ***
