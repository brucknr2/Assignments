Abstract    :
              9413164  Peterson    This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean
              Circulation  Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP).  The
               PI will provide hydrographic support and scientific leadership for  the Indian
              Ocean survey in the vicinity of Madagascar, designated  as WOCE section
              I-4/I-5W/I-7C.  This section crosses the western  boundary currents in such a
              way as to make it one of the definitive  sections for determining meridional
              transport of mass, heat and  salt.  ***
