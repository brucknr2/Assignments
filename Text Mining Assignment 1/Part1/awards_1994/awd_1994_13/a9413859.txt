Abstract    :
              9413859  Haroun, Medhat    This is an instrumentation award.  The
              instrumentation is for a  shake table capable of simulating earthquake motions
              on a 30,000  lb payload (up to 50,000 lbs) in both the horizontal and vertical 
              directions with strokes of + 10 and + 5 inches, respectively.  A  unique aspect
              of the earthquake engineering research thrust at  UCI is its emphasis on
              seismic safety engineering based on risk  and reliability considerations, and
              its innovative development in  control engineering for seismic protection of
              structures.  The  acquisition of the shake table would increase UCI's research
              and  teaching capabilities and aid in establishment of a unique large  testing
              facility in Southern California, an area prone to  earthquakes yet with no
              major facility of this size.  Such a  table is essential for experimental
              verification of new  theoretical results, as well as the development of
              innovative  control devices and of effective retrofit techniques.  The shake 
              table will enable researchers to study the collapse mechanisms of  structures
              such as bridges and highway systems, lifelines,  buildings, and secondary
              systems under combined horizontal and  vertical earthquake motions with large
              amplitude displacements  and to investigate the effectiveness of seismic
              protective  systems, including active, passive, and hybrid systems subjected 
              to both horizontal and vertical ground motions.  The shake table  will also
              enhance UCI's potential as an interactive/training  center from engineers from
              the Pacific rim countries.  UCI is in  an excellent position to collaborate
              with industry for testing  equipment, secondary systems and structural
              contents.  ***
