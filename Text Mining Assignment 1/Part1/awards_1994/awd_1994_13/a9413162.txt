Abstract    :
              9413162  Schlosser  This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean
              Circulation  Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP).  The
               PI will collect water samples to be analyzed for Helium/Tritium  concentration
              on IO WHP lines I-4/5, 2, 3, 8S, and 9S.  These lines  constitute legs 1, 4, 5,
              and 9N of the current ship schedule.   Specific focus will be on understanding
              mid-depth circulation and  on the release of mantle-derived He-3 along the
              Antarctic continent  during deep water formation.  Data will be used to
              constrain mid-  depth circulation of the models and to localize areas of
              extensive  ocean/atmosphere gas exchange (ventilation).  ***
