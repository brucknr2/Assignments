Abstract    :
              9413439  DeYoung  The data-handling equipment furnished by this action will be
              used  in a wide range of research activities, including:  heavy-ion  nuclear
              physics, low energy nuclear physics, nuclear theory, and  biomechanics.  This
              equipment is necessary to update and broaden  the scope of this research.  ***
