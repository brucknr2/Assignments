Abstract    :
              The development of a moveable surface scattering chamber to be  situated at the
              Advanced Photon Source for the study of  surfaces and interfaces will be funded
              with the assistance of  the Academic Research Infrastructure Program. The
              facility will  include instrumentation for surface cleaning and diagnostics, 
              electron spectroscopy, and in-situ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)  growth
              capabilities. Sample holders will be designed for use in  the 10-2500 K
              temperature range. The X-ray scattering will  feature a state-of-the-art 6
              circle diffractometer.  The  surface scattering chamber will normally be set up
              on a bending  magnet beamline. The research topics to benefit from this 
              facility include: 1) surface crystallography and phase  transitions of clean
              metal and semiconductor surfaces; 2) alloy  and multicomponent surfaces; 3)
              chemically induced structural  changes; 4) nonmetal-to-metal transitions in
              ultrathin films;  5) step-flow growth; 6) buried interfaces; 7) self-assembled 
              organic monolayers; 8) magnetic scattering from  surfaces and  interfaces; 9)
              time-dependent studies of surface phase  transformations; 10) coherent X-ray
              scattering from surfaces.    A moveable surface scattering chamber for use at
              the Advanced  Photon Source synchrotron will be developed for the study of 
              surfaces and interfaces. The research will involve the  structure and phase
              transitions of surfaces including time-  dependent studies and unusual
              nonmetal-to-metal transitions in  ultrathin films, chemically induced changes
              in surfaces, buried  interfaces, magnetic scattering from surfaces, and
              coherent X-  ray scattering from surfaces.
