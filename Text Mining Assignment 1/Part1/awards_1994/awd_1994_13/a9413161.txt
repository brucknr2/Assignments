Abstract    :
              9413161  Smethie  This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean
              Circulation  Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP).  The
               PI will collect water samples to ba analyzed for CFC concentration  on IO WHP
              lines I-8S, 9S, 8N, and 5E.  These lines constitute legs  1 and 3 of the IO
              WHP>.  Specific focus will be on formation and  circulation of Subantarctic
              Mode Water, Antarctic Intermediate  Water, thermocline ventilation, and the
              extent to which equatorial  currents transport recently ventilated water.  The
              additional  measurement of CC1-4 will allow study of longer time scales from 
              the same samples.  ***
