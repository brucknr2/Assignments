Abstract    :
              9413242  Prasad    Dr. Prasad will elucidate the observed molecular composition
              of interstellar  clouds through evolutionary chemical-dynamical models.  In
              contrast to most  previous equilibrium chemical models which assume fixed
              physical conditions,  the proposed models will account for the fundamental
              interaction between the  chemistry and dynamics.  It is expected that the new
              models can better clarify:  (1) The processes by which a given cloud can attain
              its present state; (2) how  it will further evolve with time, and (3) the
              growing difficulties that are  confronting current static pseudo-time-dependent
              gas phase chemical models.   This award is under the Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research program at NSF.
