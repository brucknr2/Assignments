Abstract    :
              9413172  Firing  In this project, PIs will directly measure ocean velocity
              structure  along six WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) sections as part of the 
              Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE), and begin data processing and  initial
              scientific analyses.  Measurements will be made on sections  designated as WOCE
              sections I2 (10degN), I7S (54degE), I5W/I4  (25degS and 30degS), I7N (Arabian
              Sea), I8N/I5E (80degE and  30degS), I9N (95degE), and I8S/I9S (meridional
              sections SE of  Australia).  A shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
              (ADCP)  will be used on all sections, with full depth profiles of velocity 
              structure made at selected portions of these sections using a self-  contained
              ADCP lowered with the CTD (Conductivity/Temperature/ 
              (Conductivity/Temperature/Depth)Depth) unit.  In addition to determining
              various aspects of the  current structure, the data will provide an additional
              constraint  for inverse models.
