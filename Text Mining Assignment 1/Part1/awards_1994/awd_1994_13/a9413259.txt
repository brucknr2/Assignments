Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9413259  J. Zemel and J. Santiago-Aviles    University of
              Pennsylvania will organize "coalition" of universities to promote joint
              research and educational projects between U.S. universities and institutions
              from Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico).  The research topics
              will cover water quality control, flow measurements, biosensors and actuators,
              and turbulent flow studies.  A network of six universities has been created,
              and other universities will be  contacted for their collaboration after the
              coalition will be active.  The co-P.I.s plan to apply the "sandwich" program
              for graduate students, where the students conduct research in two universities
              and receive joint degrees.  The research topics were selected to be suitable
              for the group of Latin American countries involved.  A main benefit of the
              proposed coalition is the student and faculty exchange program.  Secondary
              benefits of this experiment are networking of researchers from different 
              countries, and the generation of common data bases to serve the community at
              large.  The development of joint educational and research projects with Latin
              America is of importance for the U. S. community.  If successful, the proposed
              educational/research coalition may provide useful results in research and human
              resources in several countries, as well as a reference for future collaborative
              projects.  ***
