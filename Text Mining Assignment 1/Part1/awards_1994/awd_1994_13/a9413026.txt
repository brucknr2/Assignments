Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  P.I.:  Ain Sonin  MIT  CTS-9413026      Objects, materials or
              components may be built up by precise deposition and solidification of molten
              microdrops under controlled thermal conditions.  This provides a means of true
              "digital micro-fabrication" or fabrication of 3D objects or materials in
              microdrop units under complete computer control, much in the same way that 2D
              hard copy is obtained by ink-jet printing. Shape can in principle be controlled
              accurately, properties can be tailored via the choice of melt materials,
              droplet size and thermal conditions, and there is no waste.  Numerous
              applications are conceivable:  rapid prototyping, customized parts produced
              directly under computer control, materials or parts with continuously varying
              or heterogeneous properties to meet special needs, etc.  Particularly
              interesting possibilities arise in electronics packaging.  Customized 3D
              microcircuits could in principle be fabricated, complete with simple components
              like resistors and with protective insulation.    The purpose of the present
              research is to develop, via experimentation and theoretical modeling, a
              fundamental knowledge base for precise dropwise deposition and solidification
              at the microscale.  This has until recently been a largely unresearched field. 
              In this one year project, experiments will be performed which will lead to a
              basic understanding of the solidification angle in microscase melt deposition
              on subcooled targets.  Insofar as discoveries permit, the results will be
              expressed in terms of universal scaling laws, and the physical processes
              controlling solidification will be identified.  The second objective is to
              provide a theory for instabilities observed in earlier work on sweep deposition
              of beads on molten material onto substrate materials.
