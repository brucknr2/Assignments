Abstract    :
              A  Cameca  IMS-6F  Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer  (SIMS)  and  associated 
              peripheral equipment will be  acquired  with  funds  from  the Academic
              Research Program. This new SIMS will replace  a  Cameca  IMS-3F  SIMS which has
              been used  for  more  than  a  decade, but is no longer a state-or-the-art
              facility that meets  all  the  needs of the adjacent user committee.  The  new 
              SIMS  model will give greatly enhanced sensitivity, will provide much  better 
              spatial/depth resolution for depth profiling, and  will  provide   improved 
              sample  charging  compensation.   The   new  equipment  will make possible for
              the first time  the  analysis  and  detection of carbon and oxygen negative
              ions. The facility  will  be  used  in research projects involving:  1)  thin 
              film  deposition  and  processing, 2) surface preparation  technology  for 
              microelectronic processing, 3) fabrication and measurement  of   shallow 
              junctions,  4)  SIMS  analytical  technique   and  instrumentation development
              involving automated  sample  charge  neutralization  control, high spatial
              resolution  SIMS  imaging  and digital control of depth profiling parameters.  
               A  secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) with state-of-the-art  sensitivity, 
              sample charging compensation,  and  spatial/depth  resolution  for depth
              profiling will be acquired to replace  an  older  spectrometer  that  is  no
              longer  has  state-of-the-art  capabilities. The new spectrometer will be used
              for  thin  film  deposition  and processing, surface preparation technology 
              for  microelectronic  processing, fabrication  of  shallow  junction  devices
              and the development of new SIMS system capabilities.
