Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program this project by Professors   Gust
              and Moore of Arizona State University will design, synthesize, and   study
              multicomponent supramolecular species that are molecular  triads   and pentads
              consisting of porphyrins, quinones, and carotenoids which   perform as light
              activated switches, OR gates, or NAND gates and other   logic elements. Mimicry
              of biological membranes using fullerenes   covalently bonded to carotenoid
              polyenes and incorporated into liposomes   will also be explored. Various
              structural permutations and combinations   of porphyrins, fullerenes, quinones,
              and carotenoids into supramolecular   structures will be studied.    This
              investigation will build  complex molecular structures from   molecules similar
              to chlorophyll and beta carotene  found in plants to   create light harvesting
              materials with unique properties.  Applications   of these supramolecular
              compounds to the transport of energy and in   mimicking  transistors will be
              studied.
