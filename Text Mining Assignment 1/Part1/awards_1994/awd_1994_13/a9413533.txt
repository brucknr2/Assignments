Abstract    :
              9413533  Shankar    This award will provide an IC tester for VLSI circuits and
              Integrated IC Systems. This tester will be part of a new Center for VLSI and
              Systems Integration (CVIS).    The tester will be used in the following
              research projects associated with CVIS: (1) Integration of test into
              hierarchical structured design methodology; (2) Mixed signal testing and
              eventual integration into a seamless environment; (3) Characterization of low
              voltage analog and digital designs; (4) VLSI for parallel optical character
              recognition; (5) Testing of MEMS; and (6) Testing of MCM packages.  ***
