Abstract    :
              Windom  9413534  This award provides funding for acquisition of a system 
              upgrade to the existing Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass  Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
              located at the Skidaway Institute of  Oceanography (SkIO).  This upgrade will
              consist of a laser  ablation system that allows for multi-element analysis of 
              solid samples, an ElectroThermal Vaporization (ETV) furnace  that allows
              multi-element detection limits about one ppb  using an interference eliminating
              "dry" plasma, and a  mistral high-efficiency nebulizer that dissolves samples 
              before induction into the ICP-MS.  Investigations to be  undertaken with this
              advanced capability include fish  otilith layer trace metal analysis, rare
              earth element  determinations, Thorium ratios in marine sediments, trace  metal
              mobilization and transport in rivers, estuarine  geochemical processes,
              sediment geochemistry, and  groundwater discharge effects on coastal ocean
              chemistry.  SkIO will contribute over 100% in matching funds for this 
              acquisition and the upgraded instrument will serve as a  regional asset for
              area environmental, geological and marine  sciences universities and research
              institutions.  ***
