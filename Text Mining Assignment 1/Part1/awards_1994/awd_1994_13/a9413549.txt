Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9413549  Jonathan Barnett    This proposal requests funds to
              acquire laboratory instruments and experimental apparatuses for a fire science
              laboratory.  The instrumentation will be used in a new fire science laboratory
              being constructed at the Worchester Polytechnic Institute.    The Cone
              Calorimeter will be used to collect fundamental material properties for use in
              computer fire modeling.  In addition to a similar use, the Room Calorimeter
              will be used for model validation.  A computer workstation will be used for a
              dedicated computational platform.    The new equipment will be used to attract
              new graduate students to the WPI's fire protection engineering program, enhance
              the laboratory components of the doctoral level scholars funded by an NSF GRTP
              grant, and help expedite the development of a new generation computer fire
              model.  An university-based comprehensive fire research program supported by a
              large group of scholars will be developed.
