Abstract    :
              9413222  Fine  In this projct, the PI will collect and analyze samples for 
              Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) on WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP)  sections, I-7N
              (Arabian Sea), I-9N (95degE and Bay of Bengal), I-10  (Indonesia to Australia),
              and I-5W/I-4 (25degS and 30degS) as part  of the WOCE Indian Ocean Expedition
              (IOE).  The objective is to  describe and quantify the strength of the
              thermohaline circulation,  using the water mass age information inherent in the
              CFC  distributions, to evaluate the extent of ventilation with respect  to
              atmospheric gases, and to constrain water mass circulation  pathways, sources,
              and spreading rates.
