Abstract    :
              9413171  Gordon  In this project, the PI will serve as chief scientist on a 
              hydrographic line in the Bay of Bengal, from the Ganges delta to  near the
              equator, designated by the World Ocean Circulation  Experiment (WOCE) as line
              I9N.  Focus will be on the meridional  distributions of properties in the major
              basin of the Bay of  Bengal.  Data will be combined with other data obtained by
              the PI  under other projects to investigate the effects of the Indonesian 
              Throughflow on circulation within the Indian Ocean basin in  general, and the
              Bay of Bengal in particular.
