Abstract    :
              9413346  Hills    This award will establish a high speed, wireless data
              communications infrastructure on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University. The
              research efforts supported by this new infrastructure are devoted to making
              ubiquitious wireless data communications service available to small mobile
              computers.     The research activities to be supported by the new
              infrastructure are the CODA project, which is concerned with shared data access
              over wireless links; the development of a series of wearable computers;
              development of the Mobile Host Routing Protocol, which provides network layer
              addressing service to mobile terminals; and a computer model, which is being
              used to explore the engineering and economic aspects of wireless networks. The
              applications being developed are: the FRIEND system, which supports emergency
              management, the Health Link system, which supports home health care; and
              Wireless Andrew, a proposed application which will make available on wireless
              terminals the full functionality of "Andrew," Carnegie Mellon's campus
              computing network.  ***
