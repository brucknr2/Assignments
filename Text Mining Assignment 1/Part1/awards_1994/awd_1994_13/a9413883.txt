Abstract    :
              CTS-9413883    Density functional theories will be used to develop an
              understanding of the structure and energetics of the solid-fluid interface. 
              The effects of a variety of intermolecular interaction potentials on the
              interfacial properties and crystallization dynamics will be investigated.  The
              study may provide some insight into the nucleation and growth of crystals in
              binary mixtures.  The results are expected to be important scientifically and
              also useful in improving separation processes based on solidification.
