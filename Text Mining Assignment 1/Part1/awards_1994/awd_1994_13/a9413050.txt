Abstract    :
                   The overall goal of this research is to determine the  physically most
              representative and computationally efficient ways  of handling data
              assimilation in numerical weather forecast models.   This award will allow the
              principal investigator to continue his  research into the use of variational
              methods applied to numerical  forecast models.  In collaboration with
              scientists at the National  Center for Environmental Prediction (formerly the
              National  Meteorological Center or NMC), he will systematically explore the 
              contribution to the forecast improvement and computational costs of  including
              various physical processes.  A second research topic  involves the use of
              parameter estimation using adjoint methods as  another means of improving
              forecasts.  In this case, the PI will  explore model sensitivity to seasonal
              and geographical as well as  meteorological parameters.       The principal
              investigator's work has contributed and will  likely continue to contribute to
              improvements in operational  weather forecasting while advancing fundamental
              knowledge of  numerical techniques.  ***
