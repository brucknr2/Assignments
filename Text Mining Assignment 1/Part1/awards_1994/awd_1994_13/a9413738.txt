Abstract    :
                This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at Union College acquire a FT-IR spectrometer and OPO
              Laser System which will  be used in research.  The research activity to be
              supported includes (1) the study of the optical  properties of defects and
              radiation induced damage processes in insulating solids; (2) non-  linear and
              chaotic dynamics, and laboratory based astrophysical research relating to the 
              interstellar medium; (3) the development of diode-laser-based fluorescence
              spectrometers,  and detectors for flow injection analysis; (4) investigations
              of the binding of organic  molecules to cyclodextrin (CD) and CD polymer (CDP)
              molecules; and (5) measure elastic  wave velocities and thermal diffusivity of
              small samples of geologically interesting species.    A tunable infrared laser
              can provide important information about chemical reactivity.  Its use  may
              enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and
              nonreactive of  molecules.
