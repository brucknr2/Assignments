Abstract    :
                            9413360  Scheffler       This project involves the dissertation
              research of an  anthropology student from Yale University in Mali, West 
              Africa.  The project is to document the importance of  political speakers,
              known as "griots", in Mali politics.  Using ethnographic techniques such as
              participant  observation, intensive interviewing, analysis of media,  public
              documents and archives, the student will analyze the  changes in recent history
              of how griots, as clients of  powerful "patrons" and as independent
              commentators, shape  and express public opinion.       This research is
              important because it advances our  expertise of political behavior in this
              important area of  the world at the same time that it provides a case study of 
              the role of the media in a very different political system  than ours.  Such
              comparisons will advance our understanding  of general political processes of
              attitude formation.  ***
