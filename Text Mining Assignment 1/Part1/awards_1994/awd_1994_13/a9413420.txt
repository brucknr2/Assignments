Abstract    :
              9413420  Hemmendinger    Acquisition of Equipment for Research on High-Level
              Design of Concurrent Systems.  The grant will support research in four areas of
              system design:  a) high- level synthesis of digital systems, b)
              hardware-software codesign, c) combining formal verification with high-level
              synthesis tools, and d) analysis and design of fault-tolerant network
              protocols.      The equipment to be acquired with the grant includes a lab of
              high performance workstations, a two-cpu file server, and digital design and
              test equipment to facilitate rapid prototyping: a FPGA programmer,
              data-generator and logic analyzers.  The software tools for the lab include a
              VHDL language simulator and synthesis tool, together with  experimental tools
              that are based on VHDL, but give the designer the ability to write
              specifications directly in the familiar terms of finite-state automata, for
              rapid exploration of design alternatives.    The research in this area will
              include the refinement of these tools for hardware/software codesign and the
              development of better metrics of the cost of hardware and software design
              solutions.    ***
