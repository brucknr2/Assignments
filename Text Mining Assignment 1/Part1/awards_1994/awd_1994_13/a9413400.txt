Abstract    :
              9413400  Oden       The University of Texas at Austin has established an 
              interdisciplinary institute focusing on Computational and  Applied Mathematics.
               The emphasis is on the expanding roles  of mathematics and computer modeling
              and computer  simulation.       The CAM graduate program is interdisciplinary
              in  content, scope, and structure.  It operates outside of the  Colleges of
              Natural Sciences and Engineering and reports  directly to the Graduate School. 
              All CAM faculty hold  tenure in one of the participating academic departments: 
              Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Chemical  Engineering,
              Chemistry, Computer Sciences, Electrical and  Computer Engineering,
              Mathematics, Petroleum Engineering and  Physics.       This award will provide
              matching funds for a graduate  fellowship program at TICAM, which is amid at
              attracting  excellent students who are U.S. Citizens or Nationals.
