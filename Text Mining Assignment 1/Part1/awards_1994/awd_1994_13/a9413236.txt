Abstract    :
              9413236  Johnson  This award renews support for an Research Training Group (RTG)
              that is a joint effort of 15 faculty in the Departments of Chemistry,
              Biochemistry, Microbiology and Genetics at the University of Georgia.  The
              program provides training for undergraduate and graduate students in detailed
              understanding the role of transition metals, such as iron, molybdenum and
              tungsten, in a variety of biological systems.  The general area is sometimes
              called inorganic biochemistry; its importance is underlined by observations
              that indicate that at least a third of known enzymes include a transition metal
              ion.  Areas of research pursued by the faculty include systematics, genetics
              and metabolism of hyperthermophilic bacteria, structure-function studies of a
              variety of metalloproteins of bacterial, fungal and mammalian origin,
              regulation of gene transcription by mercury, and de novo design and synthesis
              of metalloproteins.    The collaborative research and training sponsored by the
              RTG has three facets, all aimed at providing trainees with an understanding of
              where metalloproteins come from, their role in the organism, and the structure
              and function of metalloproteins at the molecular level.  The first facet
              involves undergraduates in faculty research programs during the summer;
              students are recruited nationally with emphasis on students at small colleges
              who might otherwise not have the opportunity to participate in hands-on
              research.  The second facet is directed at graduate students; required training
              includes lecture and laboratory courses in microbial genetics, enzymology,
              bioinorganic chemistry, and molecular modeling, other required and elective
              courses, and thesis research.  The third major portion of the training program
              is a 10-day summer workshop taught by RTG and external faculty.  About 25 RTG
              students and 50 first or second-year graduate students and a few postdocs and
              junior faculty from other U.S. institutions attend the workshop.  The workshop
              will continue on a biennial basis duri ng the renewal period as NSF support
              phases out.  Though the workshop was first offered in 1991, it has already had
              a significant impact on the education of graduate students from around the
              country.    ***
