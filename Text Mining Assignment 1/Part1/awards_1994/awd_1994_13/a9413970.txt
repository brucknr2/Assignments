Abstract    :
              9413970  Karner  This is an award to provide support for purchase of equipment
              to  be used in research, education and engineering design projects.  These
              projects all involve determination of the chemical quality  of water.  Projects
              on which the equipment will be used include  studies of groundwater
              denitrification, the geochemistry of  groundwater in lignite interactions,
              electrochemical remediation  of contaminated groundwater, biochemical
              indicators of persistent  chemical pollutants, anaerobic wastewater treatment
              processes and  assessment of groundwater pollution potential based on use of 
              geographic information systems.    This proposal was submitted in response to
              the Instrumentation  Development and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 93-172,
              Academic  Research Infrastructure Program.  Results of this award are  expected
              to improve the accessibility of modern research  instrumentation for use by
              this institution's faculty in  educating students and in conducting research on
              important topics  of environmental significance.  ***
