              University of Missouri - Columbia  PI:  William Mitchell  NCR-9413031      This
              award adds four higher education institutions to the MOREnet state  network:   
                      Avila College                           Kansas City          North
              Central Missouri College          Trenton          St. Louis Community College 
                         St. Louis          State Fair Community College            Sedalla  
               Faculty and students at the institutions benefit from access to the  resources
              of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers.  In  addition, they
              are able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at  other campuses in
              pursuit of research and educational projects.    The  award provides partial
              support of the project for two years.
