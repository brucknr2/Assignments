Abstract    :
              9413732  Verosub       This award provides one-half the funding required to 
              construct an instrument system for making continuous high-  resolution
              measurements of cores of lake and marine  sediments and of soil profiles. The
              system will be installed  and operated in the Department of Geology at the
              University  of California-Davis. The University is committed to  providing the
              remaining funds required to complete the  project. When magnetic mineral grains
              are deposited as  sediment at the bottom of  water bodies under quiet 
              conditions or become incorporated in developing soil  profiles, the grains are
              aligned parallel to the geomagnetic  field, and their alignment can later be
              used to decipher the  past history of the magnetic field during the time 
              represented by the accumulation of the sediment or soil  profile. The primary
              goal of the new  instrumentation will  be to obtain continuous interpretations
              of climate change  using the variation of magnetic parameters measured along 
              the length of sediment cores. A complementary scientific  goal of the facility
              will be to obtain a history of the  behavior of the Earth's magnetic field,
              including variations  in the direction and intensity of the field.  ***
