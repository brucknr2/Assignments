Abstract    :
              9413985  Hauri       This award provides partial funding for the acquisition 
              and installation of an ion microprobe system to be operated  in the Department
              of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie  Institution of Washington. The
              Carnegie Institution of  Washington (CIW) is committed to providing the
              remaining  funds necessary for the project. The new ion microprobe  facility
              will be operated by CIW as a multi-user facility,  open to qualified scientists
              in the mid-Atlantic region and  beyond. The ion microprobe's capabilities for
              microanalysis  of chemical elements and isotopes with excellent three- 
              dimensional spatial resolution will be devoted primarily to  research in the
              fields of solid earth geochemistry,  cosmochemistry, experimental chemistry,
              and high-pressure  materials science.  ***
