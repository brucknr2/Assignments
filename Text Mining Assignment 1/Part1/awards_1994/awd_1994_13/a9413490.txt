Abstract    :
              9413490  Marzke    This award provides support to purchase a 300 MHZ Nuclear 
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer, equippped with a wide-  bore
              superconducting magnet and configured for nuclear  magnetic relaxation and
              spectroscopic studies in solids and  liquids.  The principal mission of the
              instrument is to  allow powerful, modern NMR techniques to be applied to the 
              investigation of a new class of electrolytes recently  introduced and patented
              by the co-principal investigator,  comprised of mixtures of lithium ion
              conducting salts and  polymers.  These materials have shown genuine promise for
               use in battery applications, but many of their properties  are still not
              understood, and NMR offers the best means of  studying their macroscopic
              behavior from a microscopic point  of view.  This instrument will greatly
              enhance this group's  ability to define the structures of, and the relative ion
               mobilities in, this new class of electrolytes.  ***
