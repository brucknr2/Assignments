Abstract    :
              9413032  Blum  Thomas More College requests support from NSF for connection of 
              their campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel  network located in
              the southeastern United States.  It will  provide operations management and
              information services and it  will give Thomas More College a 56 thousand bits
              per second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per 
              second) National Backbone network.    The college has experienced a growth in
              auxiliary programs that  has added value to the basic mission that the college
              serves to  aid the education of all persons of all ages.  The networking  plan
              at the college is the foundation for uniting all the  disciplines and campus
              groups.
