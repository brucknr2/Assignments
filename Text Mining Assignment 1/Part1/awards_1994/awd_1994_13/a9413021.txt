Abstract    :
              9413021  Nass  Nazareth College requests support from NSF for connection of its 
              campus network to NYSERnet.  NYSERnet is the midlevel network  located in the
              state of New York.  NYSERnet will provide  operations management and
              information services and it will give  Nazareth College a 56 thousand bits per
              second connection to the  NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
              second) National  Backbone network.    The College needs greater functionality
              and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make
              file transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
               Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a
              unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
