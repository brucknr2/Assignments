Abstract    :
              9413966  Hocken       This award provides equipment for the precision
              engineering  laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  This
               equipment forms the backbone of a set of interrelated facilities  for the
              integration of high-speed precision metrology, data  management and modeling,
              machine control, and manufacturing  processes.  The research that this
              equipment will support envisions  a manufacturing environment where design,
              metrology, machine  control and manufacturing processes are integrated in real
              or near  real-time to provide the capability of modifying the details of 
              complex manufacturing cycles according to associated design,  control, and
              metrology data.  Such a manufacturing environment  would greatly improve the
              efficiency of precision manufacturing and  create opportunities for whole new
              classes of manufactured goods,  such as those incorporating extended regions of
              deterministically  engineered surface finish.  ***
