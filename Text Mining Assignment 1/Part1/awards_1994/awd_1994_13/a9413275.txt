Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds for a meeting to be held in October 1994  near
              Huntsville, Alabama.  This grant will provide travel support  for students. 
              This will be the forth in a series of Huntsville   workshops which have in the
              past been extremely successful.  About  60 people are expected to attend this
              meeting which is devoted to  the study of the transport of plasmas within the
              Geospace  environment.
