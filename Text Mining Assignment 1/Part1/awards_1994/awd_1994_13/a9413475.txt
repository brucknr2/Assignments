Abstract    :
              9413475  Tonner    Magnetic ultrathin films of transition metals will be studied
              using  a variety of surface sensitive techniques including polarized beams  of
              soft x-rays.  The types of samples to be investigated include  single element
              ultra-thin films on single crystal substrates,  ferromagnetic bi-layers, wedged
              samples and superlattices.  The  properties to be investigated include enhanced
              magnetic moments at  surfaces, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of ultrathin
              films, and  coupling between ferromagnetic layers.  Novel magnetic properties 
              found in these materials will be related to possible applications  and
              improvements in magnetic devices.  A newly developed x-ray  magnetic circular
              dichroism microscope will be used for fundamental  studies of interlayer
              exchange coupling in wedged samples and to  understand micromagnetic
              interactions in spin-valves, magnetic  memory devices, and spin transistors.
