              Abstract  ATM-9413291  Young, John A.  University of Wisconsin  Title:
              Convection and Circulation Variability for TOGA-COARE:       Synthesis of
              Satellite and IOP Data    This research aims at extending studies supported by
              an earlier NSF  grant "McIDAS Operations and Applications for TOGA  COARE." 
              The following two aspects will be the focus.    (1) Satellite Applications and
              Convection Regimes - In this part  the focus will be on the extensive surveys
              of convective systems  observed during TOGA COARE.  Modes and scales of the
              convective  events will be studied.  The explanation of these systems will be 
              sought from satellite, rawinsonde, radar and other forms of COARE  data.    (2)
              Convection and Divergence over Large-Scale Array (LSA)  This part deals with
              comparing space time scales of convective  regimes observed in satellite data
              with the corresponding GCM  analysis and forecasts to assess the quality of the
              GCM analysis  and forecasting.  This will help in improving convective 
              predictability.    All the data that can be extracted from satellite and COARE
              data  sets will be utilized.    This research is important because it seeks to
              improve our  understanding of tropical convection in the context of seasonal to
               interannual climate variability.
