Abstract    :
              9413039  Ungar    Description:  This project supports  participation by a U.S.
              team of scientists in a  joint seminar at the "International Symposium  on High
              Salinity Tolerant Plants" which is to  be held from December 12-16, 1994 at the
               University of Karachi, in Karachi, Pakistan.    Topics to be presented at the
              plenary lectures  include: the use of halophytes in arid zones;  mechanisms
              used by halophytes for overcoming  salinity; population biology of halophytes; 
              genetic diversity in mangroves; mechanism of  salinity tolerance in mangroves;
              genetic  transformation of halopytes as a technique for  improvement of crops;
              salt tolerance of  lacustrine and coastal varieties of dune  plants; mechanism
              of salt tolerance in  herbaceous halophytes; and seed bank ecology.   The
              symposium will also include submitted  papers from some 30 countries.  A
              proceedings  of the refereed papers and other presentations  will be published
              after the symposium and will  be available in the U.S., Pakistan, and other 
              countries.    Scope:  The project supports a symposium in an  area of major
              importance to many countries that  have large irrigation systems, including the
               U.S. and Pakistan.  Research in this field  combines several important
              scientific  disciplines including biophysics, biochemistry,  genetics, as well
              as engineering and irrigation  practices.  Scientists from Pakistan, who have 
              made significant advances in experimenting with  salinity-tolerant plant
              varieties in the last  two decades, will be able to share their  insight in the
              field.  Participants from the  U.S. and from the U.K., Germany and Australia 
              will provide expertise in the basic mechanisms  leading to the desired
              salinity-tolerance in  plant varieties.  The exchange of information  during
              the symposium should lead to better  collaboration and integration of results,
              and  possibly to significant improvements,  worldwide, in understanding how to
              increase  crop yields in salt-affected or marginal lands.  ***
