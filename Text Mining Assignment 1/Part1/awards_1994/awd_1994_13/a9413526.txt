Abstract    :
              9413526  Wenner  This is a Career Advancement Award to Dr. Patricia Wenner at
              Bucknell University.  Dr. Wenner, a member of the Computer Science Department
              at Bucknell, will be at the San Diego Supercomputer for a year's sabbatical
              working with visualization scientists at the center.  Her project centers on
              developing a research plan which will explore the feasibility of extending
              visualization software with the use of object-oriented methods.  Work in
              visualization systems will be extensively examined, to more thoroughly
              understand the approach in the current commercial and research systems.  The
              applicability of object-oriented data based management systems will be studied.
               Her work will also be oriented toward the massive amounts of data needed to
              describe the earth's climate.
