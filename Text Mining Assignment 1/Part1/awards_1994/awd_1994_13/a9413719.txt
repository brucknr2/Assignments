Abstract    :
                  9413719  Kang  This Academic Research Infrastructure Program
              (Instrumentation)  grant is to partially fund the acquisition and development
              of an  ultra-high vacuum apparatus that couples high temperature stress 
              testing with chemical materials science measurements.  Multi-  disciplinary
              materials research involving high temperature  structural materials development
              will be carried out on Ni-based  alloys, metal matrix composites, carbon based
              composites and thin  film coatings on fibers and surfaces.  ***
