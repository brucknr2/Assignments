Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9413130  Hennage    A request has been made for funding to help
              offset the costs of travel of students, junior university faculty, and other
              faculty in order to attend the 1994 Laser Applications To Chemical Analysis
              Topical Meeting, to be held March 8-11, 1994 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  This
              meeting is sponsored by the Optical Society of America and will include topics
              in atmospheric and remote sensing, real-time aerosol analysis, biological
              applications, material processing control and sensors, diagnostics of molecules
              and atoms on surfaces, molecular identification spectroscopy, combustion and
              plasma diagnostics, trace-elemental analysis, single atom-molecule detection,
              laser sources and spectroscopic instrumentation, sensors, and novel diagnostics
              techniques and concepts.
