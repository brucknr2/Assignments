Abstract    :
              9413239  Davis  This award renews support for a Research Training Group (RTG) at
              the University of Minnesota.  Participating faculty include members of the
              Departments of Geology, of Geography and of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior. 
              The RTG emphasizes training at the undergraduate and graduate student level
              with focus on understanding the relationship of past climate changes and
              various changes in the physical and biological landscape.  Research areas
              include studies of the effects of climate on the growth and diversity of
              vegetation, on marine organisms, and on lakes and other aspects of the physical
              landscape, using the geological record as an indicator.  Recent effects of
              human habitation (anthropogenic change) on climate and the landscape are also
              studied using techniques similar to those used to look at more ancient effects.
               Funds provided by the award will be used to support training of graduate
              students through short (3 month) or medium term (1-2 year) fellowships, small
              research awards for costs of research or meeting attendance, and travelling
              awards that allow the trainees to attend short courses at other institutions or
              allow students from other institutions to come to the RTG to learn specialized
              techniques.  Training of undergraduates is supported both during the summer and
              academic years.  Since the analysis of the localization and distribution
              naturally occurring isotopes plays a key role in the RTG's research activities,
              an important aspect of the award has been partial support for purchase and
              operation of modern sampling and analytical instrumentation to be used by the
              trainees.  ***
