Abstract    :
              9413177  Pillsbury    In this project, the principal investigators will deploy
              three  arrays of current meter moorings along 20 degrees South in the  Indian
              Ocean and make related Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD)  stations, as part
              of the Indian Ocean Expedition of the World Ocean  Circulation Experiment
              (WOCE).  Objectives are to describe water  characteristics, velocity structure,
              and transport of the three  systems of deep western boundary currents
              postulated to exist in  the region.  The observations will provide the
              foundation for the  first direct measurement of the meridional overturning rate
              in the  Indian Ocean - a measurement needed for assessment of the role of  the
              ocean in climate prediction.
