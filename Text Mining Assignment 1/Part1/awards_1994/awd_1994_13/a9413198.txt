Abstract    :
              9413198  Jordan  This award to Frank Jordan and a group of 11 other faculty will
              support a multi-disciplinary training program in biophysical aspects of
              cellular processes at Rutgers University-Newark, an urban campus with
              significant enrollement of minority students.  The faculty group have excellent
              research programs in three related areas: structure and dynamics of biological
              macromolecules, analysis of cellular transport mechanisms, and biophysics of
              excitable cells.  The award will support training of students at the
              undergraduate and graduate levels; funds awarded will provide student stipends
              and tuition, purchase research instruments and supplies to be used by trainees,
              seminars by outside experts and student travel.  Current training activities
              will be enriched by three new laboratory courses and additional required
              rotations in faculty laboratories.  ***
