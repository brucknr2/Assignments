              Abstract  ATM-9413293  Sui, C.H.  University of Maryland  Title: Atmospheric
              Convection, Surface fluxes and Ocean Mixing         During TOGA COARE    This
              is a three year project to study multi-scale organization of  atmospheric
              convection, surface fluxes, and ocean mixed layer  structure in the TOGA COARE
              domain during IOP.  The work has two  major components.    1) Analysis and
              integration of TOGA COARE observations, including   ISS/PSS soundings, high
              solution GMS satellite data, radar data,  air sea fluxes and ocean mixed layer
              measurements, obtained during  COARE domain during IOP.    2) Utilization of
              TOGA COARE observations to simulate convective  radiative mixing processes
              within OSA based on a two dimensional  version of Goddard Cumulus Ensemble
              Model (GCEM) and an embedded  mixed layer-Ocean circulation model (MLOM).    A
              better understanding of multi-scale processes achieved by this  research
              project is essential for improving the physical processes  in climate models. 
              The expected achievement of the proposed  research will help to enhance our
              capability in simulation and  prediction of climate variability.
