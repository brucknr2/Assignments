Abstract    :
              9413146  Ward    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Jerome V. Ward,
              Botanical  Research Institute of Texas (BRIT), to make a short-term visit to 
              the Philippines to finalize plans with Dr. Lolita J. Bulalacao,  Botany
              Division, National Museum, Manila, for cooperative  research on vegetation and
              climatic history of the Philippines.   During the three-week visit, the
              collaborators expect to (1)  establish personal links for future collaboration
              and  experimental design and (2) collect and analyze field samples in  order to
              demonstrate that the project has sufficient scientific  merit to justify
              support of a future cooperative research  proposal.    The collaborators expect
              to address several open questions for a  paleoecology study.  This preliminary
              research and the larger  project on tropical palynology, to follow, will
              provide new  insights into Late Quaternary environmental change and vegetation 
              instability, Holocene plant species migrations and population  expansions, and
              prehistoric human impacts on the tropical  forests.  The present project is
              ancillary to the Flora of the  Philippines Project (supported in part by NSF
              Grants No. INT-  9320518 and INT-9442970) which is surveying the remaining
              native  forests, cataloging all vascular plant species, and documenting  the
              plant diversity in the Philippines.  The PI and his Filipino  collaborator are
              well trained in this field of research.  This  project is relevant to the
              objectives of the East Asia and  Pacific Program which seeks to increase the
              level of cooperation  between U.S. and East Asian scientists and engineers
              through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques 
              and through collaboration on problems of mutual interest and  benefit.  ***
