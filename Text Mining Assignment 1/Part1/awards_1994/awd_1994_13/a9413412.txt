Abstract    :
              This request is for an integrated system of state-of-the art  instruments for
              recording and analyzing human multi-joint  movement.  These instruments will
              enable simultaneous  measurement of movement kinematics (position-time 
              functions), kinetics (forces), and muscle activity patterns.  The system will
              be used for both research and research  training related to the control of
              human posture and  movement.  The focus of the research activities will d the 
              control of goal-directed arm reaching movements and  associated postural
              adjustments.  However, the system will  also support work on other multi-joint
              behaviors including  gait and balance control.  In addition to instruments for 
              measuring kinematics, kinetics and electormyographic (emg)  activity, the
              system will include a device for servo-  controlling the forces exerted hand
              during arm movements and  for controlling the visual information available to
              the  subject during visually guided reaches.
