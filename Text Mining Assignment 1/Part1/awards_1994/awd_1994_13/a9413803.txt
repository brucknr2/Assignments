Abstract    :
              9413803  Chao                  Three research projects are supported by this
              research infrastructure award:  (1) ``A Multicast Output Buffered ATM Switch'',
              (2) ``Priority Queue Management for ATM Switches'', and (3) ``An Experimental
              ATM LAN Testbed''. These projects involve VLSI chip design, switch fabric and
              congestion control device prototyping, theoretical analysis, computer
              simulations, and experiments on a high-speed ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
              network testbed.    In the first project, we plan to prototype a 32x32 ATM
              switch fabric based on our proposed MOBAS (Multicast Output Buffered ATM
              Switch) architecture in order to demonstrate the capability of growing the
              prototyped switch to a large switch (e.g., with several hundred input and
              output ports).  We will design and fabricate two application specific
              integrated circuit (ASIC) chips using the advanced CMOS 0.8-micron technology
              (available from the NSF funded MOSIS).  In the second project, we will first
              investigate the performance and implementation complexity of several different
              queue management control schemes that combine the priority cell discarding and
              the  priority cell departing schemes.  We will then implement one of the queue
              management schemes and integrate with the ATM switch.  In the third project, we
              plan to deploy an experimental ATM local area network (LAN) in Polytechnic
              University.  The ATM LAN will be connected to a wide-area network, called
              NYNET, through a SONET OC-3 optical link (155.52 Mbit/s), for conducting
              various experiments such as B-ISDN service applications, distributed
              processing, system performance measurement, congestion/flow control, and
              network  management.  ***
