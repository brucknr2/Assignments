Abstract    :
              9413880  Soyster  Pennsylvania State University, University of Washington,
              University  of Puerto Rico, and the Department of Energy/Sandia National 
              Laboratories have teamed up to create an alternative core  curriculum in
              undergraduate engineering focused on manufacturing.   This new curriculum,
              which may start as early as the student's  freshman year, will feature
              practice-based courses, building  prototypes in a "Learning Factory", and
              student teams that compete  for internal funding to build a new "product" on
              time and within  budget-just as they would in a firm.  The schools anticipate
              this  new curriculum will eventually attract one third of their  undergraduate
              engineering students.  These three universities alone  graduate 4% of the
              nation's engineers each year, including 4.2% of  the women and 11.7% of the
              minority engineers.
