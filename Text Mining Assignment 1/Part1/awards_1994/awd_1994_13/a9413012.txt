Abstract    :
              9413012  Bosart        Using data from previously completed field projects, this
               research will focus on diagnostic studies of the structure and life  cycle of
              mesoscale weather systems and their interactions with the  larger scale flow
              over North America and adjacent oceanic regions.   Emphasis will be placed on
              understanding how topographic barriers  and baroclinic zones (e.g. coastal
              zones in winter) act to trigger  organized mesoscale disturbances and fronts
              and/or modify existing  transient disturbances.          The research
              methodology will involve conventional synoptic   and mesoscale case studies
              using the special data sets.  An  important component of the research will
              involve the continuation  of an ongoing cooperative study with a NOAA scientist
              that involves  use of an advanced mesoscale numerical model.          Results
              of this research will improve understanding of  wintertime weather systems and
              assist in improving local forecasts  of extreme events.  ***
