Abstract    :
              9413517  Green       This award provides partial funding for the acquisition  of
              a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to be installed  and operated as a
              campus facility of the University of  California at Riverside. The University
              is committed to  providing the remaining funds needed to acquire the 
              instrument. The new TEM will serve twelve departments on the  Riverside campus.
              Users of the new facility are spread  broadly across a spectrum of disciplines
              ranging from the  physical to the biological sciences. Individual research 
              programs needing the analytical and imaging capabilities of  the new TEM
              include investigations of the cause of deep-  focus earthquakes, evolution of
              Nematoda, the hypothalamo-  neurohypophysial system, and cell communication
              mechanisms.  ***
