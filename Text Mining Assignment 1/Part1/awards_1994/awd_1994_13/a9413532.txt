Abstract    :
              9413532  Conery    This award is for the purchase of a parallel computer to do
              research in Problem Specific Programming Environments (PSPE). These
              environments will be built to use domain specific information in order to aid
              the scientist developing application programs for that area. The three PSPEs to
              be experimented with on this parallel computer are: Computation of the
              electronic structure of superconductors; simulation of mutations over
              generations; and constraint-based computations in molecular evolution. All of
              these  domains are computation intensive needing the power of a parallel
              computer.  ***
