Abstract    :
              9413241  Tirrell    This award to a group of 15 neurobiologist, cell biologists 
              and biomedical engineers will support a training program  focused on an
              important and as yet poorly understood area of  biology, the interaction of
              cells with collagen and other  matrices on which they grow.  The research and
              training  program will emphasize four aspects of this focus: one  addresses the
              fundamentals of these interactions in both  natural and artificial matrices,
              and the otheps address  interactions occurring in connective, neural and
              vascular  tissue.  The award will support training of undergraduate,  graduate
              and postdoctoral students through a mix of new and  existing courses, rotations
              and optional internships that is  sufficiently flexible to accommodate the
              needs of students  that enter with backgrounds in either engineering or 
              biology.  The trainees who emerge from the program are  expected to contribute
              to fundamental biology and to more  applied areas such as tissue engineering
              and the development  of biomimetic composite materials.    This award is also
              being supported by the Bioengineering  Program within the Division of
              Bioengineering and  Environmental Systems and by the Human Resource Development
               Program within the Division of Engineering Education and  Centers.  ***
