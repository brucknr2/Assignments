Abstract    :
              9413279  Huskamp  This proposal, submitted by the Microelectronics Center of
              North Carolina, in association with the Coalition of Academic Supercomputing
              Centers, will fund a workshop on "Broadening Participation in the MetaCenter". 
              The MetaCenter is a concept to facilitate collaboration in the many areas of
              advanced computing and computational science, such as software development,
              training and education, user support, networking, etc.  Currently, the
              MetaCenter consists largely of participants from the four NSF national
              supercomputing centers.  This three-day workshop will bring together more than
              60 participants from other organizations, such as NSF S&T centers, state and
              university advanced computing centers, NSF Engineering Research centers, and
              others to explore how the MetaCenter might be broadened to leverage other
              ongoing related activities, to provide a stronger base for the development of a
              national information infrastructure.
