Abstract    :
              9413298  Silevitch  To supplement an existing National Science Foundation
              Industry-University Cooperative Research Center, Northeastern University has
              teamed with the Bay State Skills Corporation and M/A-COM to provide Transition
              Engineering Fellowships to train change agents who will bring new business to
              their companies.  These fellowships will provide mid-level defense engineers
              with the opportunity to work with university faculty and similarly situated
              engineers in other companies, forming teams to move new technology to prototype
              fabrication and products.  ***
