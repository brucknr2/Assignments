Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. H.S. Gutowsky of the Chemistry Department of the   University of Illinois
              at Urbana-Champaign will engage in a series of   continuing investigations on
              the structure and dynamics of weakly bound,   van der Waals and hydrogen
              bonded, molecular complexes.  The technique   employs a gas mixture cooled to
              near zero kelvins by a supersonic   expansion into a high vacuum and studied by
              pulsed Fourier transform   microwave spectroscopy.  Specifically, complexes
              containing benzene   dimers, complexes formed by rare gas atoms with hydrogen
              cyanide, and   those formed by argon with water will be investigated.  In
              addition,   ongoing work on alkali halide dimer complexes will be continued.   
              Weakly bound clusters are an intermediate form of matter that form when  
              gaseous molecules condense to form liquids or solids.  The structure and  
              dynamics of such clusters is of interest for obtaing an  understanding of  
              intermolecular forces on a molecular level,  for understanding of protein  
              folding, the orientation and mobility of  molecules on catalytic   surfaces,
              and other phenomena.  The research conducted by the PI provides   critical data
              and models for the bonding of molecules by weak   intermolecular forces.
