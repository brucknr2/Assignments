Abstract    :
              9413336  Olson  Lake Superior State University requests support from NSF for a 
              connection of its campus network to Michnet and NSFNET.  Michnet  is the
              midlevel network located in the state of Michigan that  will provide operations
              and network information services.  It  will give Lake Superior State University
              a 56 thousand bits per  second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million  bits per second) National Backbone network.    The university needs
              greater functionality and network speed to  be able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail  system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.   This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore  innovative
              educational resources.
