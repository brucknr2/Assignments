Abstract    :
              9413956  Sonek  The investigators propose to study and quantify the effects of 
              optical phase conjugation on optical trapping, and to design,  develop, and
              evaluate an optimum configuration for the integration  of various image
              processing functions, such as aberration  correction, contrast reversal, and
              novelty filtering, with an  optical tweezer and microscopic imaging, for the
              imaging and  diagnosis of micromanipulated biological samples such as cells and
               tissues.  This approach can offer substantially improved imaging  capabilities
              via contrast enhancement of phase objects; high-  resolution (submicron)
              detection and feature extraction of images  obscured by aberrating media;
              preferential display of slow and fast  moving objects; rapid nearly all-optical
              processing of image data;  and the simultaneous optical manipulation and force
              transduction of  biological samples.  ***
