Abstract    :
                      We are proposing to develop a center for cell sorting  and cell
              characterization at the University of Arkansas,  Fayetteville.  The number of
              projects positively impacted by  establishing such a center are numerous and
              varied. The  investigators involved in this proposal come from the  Colleges of
              Arts and Sciences, and Agriculture in the  general disciplines of Immunology,
              Physiology, Mycology,  Cell, Developmental and Molecular Biology.  The
              requested  flow cytometer will be utilized heavily in sorting and 
              characterizing immune cell populations. A major project will  be involved in
              identifying immune cells responsible for  melanocyte destruction in birds
              afflicted with autoimmune  vitiligo. Because of the ease of access, and ability
              to  repeatedly sample large numbers of melanocyte-specific  immune cells, the
              Smyth chicken represents a valuable animal  model for studying autoimmune
              disease. Flow cytometry would  also be used for sorting based on the ploidy of
              cultured  prostate cells. Cell sorting will also be instrumental in  screening
              for Dictyostelium transformants in efforts to  study and clone the gene for an
              antiporter from golgi  bodies.
