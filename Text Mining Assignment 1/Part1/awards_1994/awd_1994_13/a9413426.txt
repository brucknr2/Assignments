Abstract    :
              9413426  Mogk       This award provides 70 per cent of the funds required  for
              the acquisition of an x-ray diffractometer system to be  installed and operated
              in the Imaging and Chemical Analysis  Laboratory at the Montana State
              University. The Montana  State University is committed to providing the
              remaining  funds necessary for the acquisition of the equipment. The  Imaging
              and Chemical Analysis Laboratory is a centralized  facility that operates and
              maintains a pool of instruments  dedicated  to the characterization of the
              composition,  chemistry, and structure of materials for the physical  sciences,
              life sciences, and engineering disciplines at  Montana State University. The
              new x-ray diffractometer  system fills a basic gap in their instrumental pool.
