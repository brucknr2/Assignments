Abstract    :
                This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at SUNY-Stony Brook acquire a 500 MHz NMR, and an
              upgrade of an AMX 600  MHz NMR to a DMX600 MHz NMR which will be used in
              research.  The research activity to  be supported includes the structural
              investigations of five major users who work in organic  chemistry and in
              biological chemistry; the research includes studies of steroidal diamines as 
              DNA-targeted antibiotics, of electronic effects in face selection in addition
              and elimination  processes, of applications of the  -lactam synthon method and
              of  4+4  photocycloaddition  processes in approaches to taxol analogs, and of
              the configurations of synthetic oxidosqualene  cyclase and squalene epoxidase
              inhibitors.     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to  the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules.  It is used to identify  unknown  substances, charcterize
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to  study the  dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art  NMR 
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. 
              The  results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
              catalysis, and in  biology.
