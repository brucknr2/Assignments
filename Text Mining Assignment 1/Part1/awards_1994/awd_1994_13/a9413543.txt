Abstract    :
              9413543  Khorrami   This research provides funds for research equipment for
              development of high-speed, ultra-accurate motors and robotic systems for
              advanced manufacturing applications.  The focus will be on the development of
              closed-loop control of Sawyer motors using a high-resolution, two-dimensional
              position sensor.  This should provide significantly improved performance over
              the entire work area, increasing both speed and stiffness of the system.   The
              Sawyer motor is used in many robotic systems for wafer probing and assembly
              operations.  Some of the major research areas that this equipment will support
              are the control of high-speed positioning devices and structural vibration
              damping.
