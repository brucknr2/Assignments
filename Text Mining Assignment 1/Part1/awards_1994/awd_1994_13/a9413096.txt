Abstract    :
              9413096  Storm  This proposal requests funds to support the attendance of
              advanced U.S. graduate students at the 1994 Gordon Research Conference on the
              Chemistry and Physics of Micostructure Fabrication. The conference, to be held
              June 26-July 1, 1994 at Brewster Academy in Wolfeboro, NH, is being organized
              by Donald M. Tennant of AT&T Bell Laboratories (Chairman) and Margaret B. Stern
              of MIT Lincoln Laboratory (Chairman-Elect).  The science of microstructure
              fabrication is vital not only to today's information revolution but to the
              fields of imaging and manipulation of chemical and biological structures. 
              Future progress in all these disciplines in paced by advances in the science
              and technology of nanofabrication that will be discussed at this conference. 
              The conference format-a week of continuous interaction with experts in
              interrelated fields in a casual setting-provides a particularly rewarding
              opportunity for graduate students to exchange ideas with and to learn from this
              gathering of leading researchers.  ***
