Abstract    :
              9413085  Conway       Cornell University and corning will develop an innovative,
               practice-oriented, full-semester course in modern manufacturing to  be offered
              to master's students in Engineering, Management, and  Labor Relations.  This
              15-credit course will be the student's only  class for an entire semester.  Its
              innovative, total immersion  approach to improving manufacturing education
              could serve as model  for use by other universities.
