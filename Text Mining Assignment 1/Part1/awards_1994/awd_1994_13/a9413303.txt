Abstract    :
              9413303  Cheng  Table look-up is a technique widely used in computers to
              accomplish  high-speed information processings.  In its implementation, 
              numerous operations are performed at an earlier time, and the input  data and
              the corresponding results are stored in a table.  When one  of the operations
              is requested at a later time using the same input  data, the processor simply
              looks at the table and retrieves the  pre-computed information.  In VLSI
              implementation, the speed of the  look-up table technique is primarily limited
              by the communication  bandwidth.  In addition, the limited number of pins
              available for  VLSI circuits prohibits parallel access of the table by multiple
               processors.  Consequently, a research effort focused on using  optical
              technology to accomplish the look-up table tasks to resolve  these problems,
              and improve overall system performance is being  proposed.  ***
