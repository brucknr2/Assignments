Abstract    :
              9413003  Parise  The objective of this work is to make novel microporous thio
              and  thio-oxide frameworks using chemical strategies based on organic 
              templates and by varying the reaction conditions.  The proposal  will explore
              the role of cation exchanges as a framework modifier  designed to produce
              materials capable of trapping and controlling  the release of gases from
              sieves.  %%%  The synthesis and characterization of open crystalline structures
               possessing regularly spaced pores and channels are of high  relevance to
              industry in strategic areas as varied as chemical  separations, catalysis, ion
              exchange, and ion conductivity.  Selected members of this class of materials
              find applications in  areas such as environmental pollution, oil refining, and 
              biosensors for the health sciences.  ***
