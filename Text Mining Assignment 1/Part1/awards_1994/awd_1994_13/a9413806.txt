Abstract    :
              A  low-energy  electron microscope (LEEM) will be  acquired  with  funds  from 
              the  Academic Research Infrastructure  Program.  The  state-of-the-art LEEM
              will be obtained from IBM where it has been  developed in-house by R. Tromp.
              Currently there are only a  small  number  of LEEMs in the entire world and
              there are large  numbers  of scientific applications to be exploited. The
              program will also  include   some   development  by  combining  scanning  
              tunneling  microscopy (STM) with LEEM and also by combining a novel  optical 
              probe  using  guided-wave  optical spectroscopy  with  LEEM.  The  research 
              will  involve  epitaxial growth  processes  and  growth  optimization  of 
              semiconductor films. Materials  systems  to  be  studied   include  silicon, 
              silicon-germanium  and  group   III-  nitrides.  An  effort  will  be made to 
              combine  supersonic  jet  deposition with LEEM.    Using  a  relatively new
              electron spectroscopy, namely low-energy  electron microscopy, studies will be
              made of the epitaxial growth  process  and  growth  optimization. The research 
              will  focus  on  silicon,  silicon-germanium and group III-nitrides.
              Collaborative  efforts  with  IBM will be initiated to develop new 
              capabilities  for this relatively new electron microscopy technique.
