Abstract    :
              The University of Texas at Austin requests funds from the  Academic Research
              Infrastructure Program of the National  Science Foundation for the purchase of
              a 500 MHz triple  resonance NMR spectrometer.  The proposed instrument will be 
              dedicated to biophysical research with state-of-the-art NMR  data collection
              requirements, and will greatly enhance the  research of eight major users.   
              The proposed instrument will significantly enhance the  following areas of
              research:    1. RNA and protein structure  2. Effects of antibiotics that
              covalently modify DNA, and  DNA-drug interactions  3. Structure of biologically
              active polysaccharides and  peptides  4. Analysis of metabolic pathways  5.
              Structure of myofibrillar proteins  6. Structure of RNA and DNA cleavage agents
               7. Enzymatic degradation of hydrocarbons  8. Studies of genetically engineered
              peptides
