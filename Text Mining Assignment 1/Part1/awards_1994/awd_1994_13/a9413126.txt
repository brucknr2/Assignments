Abstract    :
                                  9413126  Zimmerman, J. K.  The El Verde Field Station is a
              long-established research  facility in the only Neotropical rain forest under
              the  jurisdiction of the United States.  The field station is  located in the
              Caribbean National Forest, which is an  Experimental Forest, a Biosphere
              Reserve, a participating  component of the University of Puerto Rico Minority
              Research  Center of Excellence, and a site of the Luquillo Long-Term 
              Ecological Research Program.  The field station and  adjoining research area
              have been the focus of projects by  scientists from over 50 institutions in the
              United States  and other countries.  Current research projects are funded  by
              the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics  and Space
              Administration, and the USDA Forest Service.    Research and living facilities
              at the El Verde Field Station  date to the 1930's and their current size is
              restrictive to  the ongoing research activities.  This project will assist  in
              the action of a Master Plan for the field station which  will guide future
              efforts to expand and modernize the  facilities.
