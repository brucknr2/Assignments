Abstract    :
              9413086  Malmborg       Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) has teamed with
              Digital  Equipment Corporation, Martin Marrietta, Shuttleworth, and Thomson 
              Publishing to enhance an existing master's program in Manufacturing  Systems
              Engineering. The project will develop a software-based  teaching factory
              emulation facility using manufacturing experts and  RPI faculty, create a case
              library of actual industry problems, and  have students work in project teams
              for laboratory and case  projects.  RPI is a pioneer in linking management,
              engineering, and  industry to work on manufacturing problems.
