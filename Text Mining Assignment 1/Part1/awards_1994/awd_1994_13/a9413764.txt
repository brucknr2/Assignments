Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a request for instrumentation  acquisition to support
              student/faculty research in molecular  analysis of enzyme assembly.  The goal
              of this project is to  build a molecular biology laboratory that will support 
              research on the assembly and function of the proton-  translocating ATPase in
              the yeast vacuolar membrane (V-  ATPase). This instrumentation request includes
              1) a tabletop  ultracentrifuge, 2) an automated low pressure chromatography 
              system, 3) DNA sequencing equipment, 4) an imaging  densitometer, 5) nucleic
              acid hybridization equipment, 6) a  cell electroporator, and 7) yeast culturing
              equipment. Each  instrument supports a specific experimental approach that is 
              an integral part of the research program described in this  proposal.
