Abstract    :
              9413204  Schultz    This award will support the multidisciplinary training of
              undergraduate,  graduate and  postdoctoral students with a focus on
              understanding plant responses to a wide  variety  of biotic and abiotic
              stresses.  The 19 participating faculty come from 9  departments  and have
              strong research programs relevant to the focus at biochemical,  organismal  or
              populational level of analysis.  The training program will be organized  around
              an  innovative, "problem-based learning" (PBL) approach in which a particular 
              example  of plant stress will be considered by students from all three
              perspectives.  A  series of  courses is planned to implement this unusually
              broad training strategy in an  area of  great significance to modern biology.
