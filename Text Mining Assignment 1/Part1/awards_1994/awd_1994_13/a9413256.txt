Abstract    :
              9413256  CALDEIRA  This is a proposal for a workshop on legitimacy and
              compliance in  the context of processes of democratization.  The end of the
              Cold  War and the more general spread of democracy throughout the world  have
              generated tremendous intellectual interest in how  democracies arise, take
              hold, persist, and perish.  Two important  subsets of these questions are how
              and under what conditions  political and legal institutions acquire legitimacy
              and gain  compliance; and what, if any, relationship is there between the 
              legitimacy of institutions and compliance with law.  Not nearly  enough
              scholars are pursuing these theoretical and empirical  issues.  Accordingly,
              this project will develop a more  coordinated and integrated agenda of
              research.  The proposed  workshop will help to shape this agenda and develop a
              coherent  set of intellectual issues for research.  ***
