Abstract    :
              ***  9413846  Cross    This is a project  to host a bilateral workshop proposed
              by  Dr. John Cross, the Uniformed Services University and Dr.  Wilfred Tiu, the
              University of the Philippines on October 16-  20, 1995 in Manila, the
              Philippines.  The purpose of this  conference is to bring together U.S. and the
              Philippine  parasitologists to exchange ideas on the study of animal  parasites
              and their vectors, and to apply new and developing  technologies to obtain a
              better understanding of the  parasites, their biology, life cycles and vectors.
               The  conference will also provide an opportunity for junior  scientists to
              learn about host parasite relationships and  will encourage the development of
              graduate programs in  parasitology in the Philippines.  ***
