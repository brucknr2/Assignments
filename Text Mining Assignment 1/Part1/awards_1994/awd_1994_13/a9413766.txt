Abstract    :
              Various instrumentation that is collectively directed to the  experimental
              determination of the structure and dynamics of  polymers, proteins,
              polypeptides, surfactants and low molecular  weight organic molecules at
              interfaces will be purchased with  funds from the Academic Research
              Infrastructure Program. The  instrumentation to be acquired includes: 1) a
              Brewster angle  microscope/optical polarimeter, 2) a SPEX Fluorolog 212 
              spectrofluorometer, 3) a TopoMetrix TMX-2000 scanning probe  microscope, and 4)
              a nanocalorimeter. The instrumentation will  be used to study organic thin
              films composed of low-molecular  weight amphiphiles, synthetic polymers or
              proteins with  thicknesses ranging from 10 to 1000 Angstroms. The individual 
              topics include: the morphology and spectroscopy of Langmuir and 
              Langmuir-Blodgett films; monolayers subjected to homogeneous  surface flow;
              domain formation, relaxation behavior and surface  properties of thin solid
              films including lateral structure  within self-assembled monolayers; and
              thermal transitions in  ultrathin solid films.    A microscope/optical
              polarimeter, spectrofluorometer, a  scanning probe microscope and a
              nanocalorimeter will be  acquired to study organic thin films composed of
              low-molecular  weight compounds, synthetic polymers and proteins.
