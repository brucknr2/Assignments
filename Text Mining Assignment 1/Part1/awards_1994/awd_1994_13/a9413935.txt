Abstract    :
              9413935  Readhead    This project supports the development and construction of a
               research instrument -- the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) -- to  study the
              cosmic microwave background radiation on angular scales  from 2'-20' with
              sensitivity  Trms/T = 2 x 10-6.    The CBI is a four element interferometer
              operating at 28 GHz - 36  GHz.  Each element has a complement of three primary
              reflectors, of  sizes 0.75 m, 1.5 m and 3 m, which will be selected according
              to  the angular scale to be imaged.  The instrument operates on a 16 m  x 16 m
              "optical bench" on which the elements can be placed in a  wide variety of
              configurations.  The intermediate frequency and  local oscillator signals are
              distributed via optical fibres.    The CBI will make images of the cosmic
              microwave background  radiation and hence enable determination of the spectrum
              of mass  fluctuations on scales of 2 x 1012 solar mass to 2 x 1015 solar mass. 
               This will provide foundation for theories of the formation of  structure in
              the universe, and could provide a link between quantum  fluctuations in the
              very early universe and the largest structures  known.  In addition, the CBI
              will be capable of making observations  of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in
              clusters of galaxies, and will  allow us to carry out detailed studies of the
              hot gas in clusters  when used in combination with high resolution X-ray
              observations.   The CBI will also be a tool for the study of diffuse galactic 
              foreground emission.  ***
