Abstract    :
              Kushner  This conference is the second held devoted to RNA processing and mRNA
              decay in prokaryotic cells. The objectives this time focus more on the
              processes of RNA decay and processing. Because of the rapid progress in the
              area of eukaryotic mRNA (messenger) decay, one session is being held as well on
              that topic.  Other topics discussed include biological systems affected by RNA
              decay, properties of cis-acting elements that affect mRNA decay, mechanistic
              features of protein and protein complexes involved in mRNA processing and
              decay, and mRNA decay in organisms other than E. coli.  Because of its
              importance in mRNA decay and the apparent existence of eukaryotic cDNAs that
              can complement its activity, an entire session is being devoted to the enzyme
              RNase E.  %%%  There have been no other meetings devoted to this subject since
              1991.  The field is making rapid progress in understanding this important
              aspect of the regulation of gene expression.  Understanding this process will
              contribute to maximizing gene expression in a number of areas of biotechnology.
