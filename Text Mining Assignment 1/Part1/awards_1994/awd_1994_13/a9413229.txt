Abstract    :
              9413229  Phillips  This award to large group of outstanding faculty from Rice
              University, Baylor  College of Medicine and the University of Houston provides
              funds for support of  a training program on computational aspects of modern
              biology, including  experimental and theoretical analyses of macromolecular
              structure using  crystallographic, microscopic and other experimental
              techniques, and  computational analysis of genomic structure.  The faculty
              groups from each  institution provide complementary skills in biochemistry,
              biophysics and  computer science, resulting in a program broader and stronger
              than could be  provided by the individual institutions.  Important aspects of
              the training  include dual mentorship for postdoctoral trainees, a large summer
              undergraduate  program and a biannual national symposium on selected topics in
              computational  biology.    This award is also supported by the New Technology
              Program of the Division of  Advanced Scientific Computing and by the
              Computational Biology Activity of the  Division of Biological Instrumentation
              and Resources.  ***
