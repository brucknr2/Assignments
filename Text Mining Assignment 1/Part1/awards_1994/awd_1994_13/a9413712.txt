Abstract    :
              Schilling  9413712  This award provides support, through the Academic Research
              Infrastructure Program, for the acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma
              Mass-Spectrometer (ICP-MS) as the basis for the establishment of an analytical
              facility at the University of Rhode Island.  This analytical facility provides
              a needed and geographically centralized capability for researchers in
              atmospheric and ocean chemistry, marine and terrestrial geology and
              environmental science.  Specifically, the PIs intend to study mid-ocean ridge
              hotspot volcanism and mantle geochemistry, oceanic trace metal scavenging and
              related particle dynamics, paleoenvironments, atmospheric trace metal
              geochemistry, and terrestrial and marine sedimentology and geochemistry. 
              ICP-MS instrumentation is well suited to the proposed analyses because it
              provides increased efficiency and sensitivity for elemental analysis and
              negates the need for extensive sample preparation prior to analysis.  The
              instrument will serve, particularly as the core of an analytical facility, as a
              test bed for new analyses, a training asset for faculty, researchers and
              students, and also as a regional analytical resource accessible to researchers
              from neighboring New England universities and research centers.  The University
              of Rhode Island will provide 50% cost sharing for this project.  ***
