Abstract    :
              9413842  GABRIEL    Funding is requested to support the Twelfth Dissertations
              Symposium  on Chemical Oceanography (DISCO) to be held November 6-11 1994 at 
              the East-West Center, University of Hawaii campus, Honolulu,  Hawaii. 
              Twenty-six chemical oceanography candidates will meet for  six days in formal
              and informal sessions to present their  dissertations, to broaden their
              perspectives in the field, and to  participate in working groups to develop
              recommendations concerning  chemical oceanography research and education. The
              sponsors will  delineate the federal government programs in chemical
              oceanography  and present avenues for support. The proceedings will be
              published.   This will be the twelfth in a very successful series of symposia 
              supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), office of Naval  Research
              (ONR), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA).  These
              symposia have helped advance  knowledge by fostering young investigators'
              enthusiasm, broadening  their outlook of the problems in the field, and helping
              their entry  into the science network, nationally and internationally.
