Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9413838  Herbert Giescher    The School of Ceramic Engineering and
              Sciences will purchase powder and porosity characterization equipment dedicated
              to supporting research and education at Alfred University.  The equipment will
              be used for several research projects, including:  particle size
              characterization as a means of studying and controlling the precipitation,
              synthesis, and application of advanced submicron, nano-sized, ceramic powders;
              processing properties of concentrated powder dispersions; and the analysis of
              pore structure and porosity of consolidated compacts before and during the
              sintering process.  The instrumentation will also be used to enhance the
              educational program through several hands-on laboratory classes.    Future
              research interest is moving towards smaller particle sizes.  Preparation and
              processing of those materials is very important for the development of the next
              generation of advanced ceramic materials.  The requested instrumentation will
              be necessary for future research activities within the school, for
              collaboration with other universities, and will be essential for an adequate
              education of students at the New York State College of Ceramics.
