Abstract    :
              The object of this research is the acquisition of a radar (50 MHz)  and a
              Raman/Rayleigh lidar which, together with an existing radar  (1290 MHz), will
              comprise a new facility for atmospheric research  and teaching using remote
              sensing.  Some of the research topics  will include temperature of the upper
              atmosphere (lidar), and  cognate heat fluxes, clear air turbulence, and radar
              observations  of both precipitation and lightning.
