Abstract    :
              A  high end computing and scientific visualization facility  will  be  acquired
              with Academic Research Infrastructure Program  funds  to  support  a  broad
              spectrum of research and research  training  initiatives in science and
              engineering. The facility will contain  an  eight-processor  Silicon Graphics
              Power Challenge  XL  server  with  1  GB  of  memory, a 20 GB internal disk,  a
               tape  /CD-ROM  jukebox  and  4  high  end  Silicon  Graphics  workstations. 
              The  satellite  visualization clusters will be located in the  College  of 
              Engineering  and  College of Arts  and  Sciences.  The  Power  Challenge  XL
              will be the principal cycle server for large  scale  simulations  and  parallel
               algorithm  development  and  can   be  upgraded to 16 processors in the
              future. The three main areas  of  research include: 1) the modeling of advanced
              materials including  the  growth,  structure, and dynamics of  polymer  blends,
               metal  surfaces, intermetallics, alloys and disordered magnets;  2)  the 
              reaction  dynamics  of  atomic  and molecular  systems  including  electonic
              processes in the collisions of atoms with electrons and  ions,  photoprocesses
              in atoms, and gas-phase  reaction  dynamics  and  molecular  spectroscopy;  3) 
              computational  fluid  dynamics  involving  turbulent reactive flows typical of
              those involved  in  the manufacturing of various materials.    A   
              state-of-the-art   eight-processor   computer   with    four  workstations will
              be acquired for a new computing facility, which  will feature three satellite
              visualization clusters. The facility  will  be  used primarily by faculty in
              the Departments of Physics  and  Chemistry and by faculty in the College of
              Engineering.  The  research  will focus on modeling of advanced materials, 
              reaction  dynamics of atomic and molecular systems and computational  fluid 
              dynamics.
