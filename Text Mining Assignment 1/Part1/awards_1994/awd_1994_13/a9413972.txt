Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at the SUNY--Geneseo acquire a solid state 300 Mhz NMR
              spectrometer which will  be used in research.  The research activity to be
              supported includes:  (1) the synthesis and  characterization of macrocyclic
              complexes, (2) the synthesis of lipophilic and aromatic  cyclam derivatives,
              (3) the synthesis of ferrocenyl cryptands, (4) the hydride addition to 
              cyclohexanones, and (5) improved methods for mixed Wurtz-like coupling
              reactions using  Mg(O) and Cu(I).    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
