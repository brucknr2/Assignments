Abstract    :
              9413113  Char  The purpose of this meeting, held at Drexel University, 
              Philadelphia, PA on May 14, 1994, is to stimulate interest in and  enhance
              understanding of the technical aspects of computer  algebra.  The meeting will
              encourage those in the region who are  active or interested in becoming more
              active in computer algebra  to meet with each other in an inexpensive and
              easily accessible  way.  Participation by the region's graduate students will
              be  particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute  to the
              poster sessions, and through travel support.    The meeting has been endorsed
              by the ACM's SIGSAM (Special  Interest Group on Symbolic and Algebraic
              Manipulation).  ***
