Abstract    :
              9413270  Tierney  This award is being made through the Small Grants for
              Exploratory  Research program to collect data on the January 17, 1994 
              Northridge, California earthquake.  The Northridge earthquake  illustrates the
              immense potential for damage and social  disruption that earthquakes present. 
              It also provides a natural  laboratory in which investigators can obtain
              important insight on  earthquake response and recovery.  This project will
              involve the  collection of perishable information that will shed light on 
              emergency response and recovery patterns and problems following  the Northridge
              earthquake.  ***
