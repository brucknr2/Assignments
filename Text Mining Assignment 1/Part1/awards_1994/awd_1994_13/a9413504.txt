Abstract    :
              9413504  Kennedy       Quantum coherence properties of low photon number sources
               are investigated using a novel approach based on many-body  Green's function
              techniques.  These Green function methods enable  the theorist to directly
              compute the quantities of experimental  interest and in a computationally
              efficient manner.  Cavity QED  problems, collective motion of atoms, and laser
              cooling will be  examined using the new approach.  ***
