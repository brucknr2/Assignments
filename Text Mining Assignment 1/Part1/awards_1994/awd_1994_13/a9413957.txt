Abstract    :
              9413957  Williams       This award provides partial funding for the acquisition 
              of an isotope ratio mass spectrometer and an inductively-  coupled plasma mass
              spectrometer to be installed and  operated in the Department of Geological
              Sciences at the  University of South Carolina. The University of South 
              Carolina is committed to providing the remaining funds  necessary for the
              acquisition of the equipment. The  Principal Investigator and a large
              multi-disciplinary group  of colleagues require the analytical capabilities
              (accurate  isotope ratios for light stable elements, and rapid  multielement
              analysis of geological samples) of these  instruments to carry out a
              significant number of research  projects in the area of Global Change,
              including research on  past temperature variations in ancient oceans and lakes,
              the  geologic history of CO2 in the atmosphere, geochemical  cycles in the
              oceans, and the chronology of non-carbonate  sediments in marine and
              fresh-water basins.  ***
