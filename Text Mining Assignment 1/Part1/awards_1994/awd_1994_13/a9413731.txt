Abstract    :
              Orcutt  9413731  Funding from this award will be used to upgrade and enhance 
              network and digital mass storage facilities at the Institute  of Geophysics and
              Planetary Physics (IGPP) at Scripps  Institution of Oceanography (SIO). 
              Network enhancements  will be implemented through the purchase, installation,
              and  optimization of a Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).  This system
              will be of a high speed token ring architecture  and allow simultaneous, rapid
              access of large data sets by  numerous users.  The FDDI will take advantage of
              fiber optic  capabilities already installed in the IGPP building.  In 
              addition, funds will be provided for the purchase of mass  storage devices to
              interface with network assets.  185 GByte  optical library units will provide
              the basis of this mass  storage capability which will be used to store data
              from  various large-scale scientific campaigns addresing studies  in
              atmospheric and global change research, mid-ocean ridge  processes, global and
              regioal seismology, mantle convection,  geomagnetism, nuclear test detection
              studies and space  geodesy.  The University of California at San Diego will 
              provide matching funds including wiring of the IGPP building  with fiber optic
              cabling.  ***
