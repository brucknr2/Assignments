Abstract    :
              A 20 Tesla superconducting magnet system and a Fourier Transform Infrared
              (FT-IR) spectrometer will be acquired with funds from the Academic Research
              Infrastructure Program. The magnet system will be utilized in conjunction with
              the UC-Santa Barbara free-electron laser, a femto-second optical laboratory, an
              existing dilution refrigerator, and the FT-IR spectrometer to explore nonlinear
              and linear magneto-optics and magneto-transport in scientifically and
              technologically important systems. The research focuses on: nonlinear
              magneto-transport in the terahertz frequency regime associated with quantum
              wells and superlattices in semiconductors; saturation and relaxation in
              semiconductor nanostructures in large magnetic field; linear and nonlinear
              spectroscopy of vortex cores in high temperature superconductors;
              magneto-spectroscopy of self-organized quantum dots; spectroscopy of quantum
              wire superlattices; magneto-luminescence and magneto-absorption experiments in
              spin-superlattices; quantum hall effects in mesoscopic structures; and
              magneto-transport and the metal-insulator transition in conducting polymers. 
              An acquired 20 Tesla superconducting magnet system, used in conjunction with a
              free-electron laser, a femto-second optical laboratory, an existing dilution
              refrigerator, and a new acquired Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, will
              be used to study a range of topics in the magneto-optic and magneto-transport
              areas concerning semiconductor superlattices, quantum wells and quantum dots as
              well as high temperature superconductors, one-dimensional conducting polymers,
              and spin superlattices.
