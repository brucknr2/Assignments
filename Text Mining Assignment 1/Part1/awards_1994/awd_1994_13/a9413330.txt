Abstract    :
              Abstract  Florida Community College at Jacksonville - J. Tinsley  Connection to
              NSFNET  Proposal No.  NCR-9413330  Florida Community College at Jacksonville
              requests support from NSF  for connection of their campus networks to SURAnet. 
              SURAnet is the  midlevel network located in the southeastern United States.  It
               will provide operations management and information services and it  will give 
              Florida Community College a 56 thousand bits per second  connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second) National Backbone
              network.    The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be 
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail system.   Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for
              the schools to explore innovative  educational resources.
