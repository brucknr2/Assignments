Abstract    :
              9413848  Higgins    This award is for the  acquisition of  semiconductor
              processing and testing equipment to make components necessary for efficient
              electronic/photonic interfaces. Georgia Institute of Technology has developed
              "hybrid integration" techniques that allow rf and optoelectronic functions to
              be incorporated on chips with costs comparable to standard chips.  The
              equipment includes a molecular beam epitaxy unit for optoelectronic materials,
              a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition unit for deposition of dielectric
              films, an ion etcher, a flip-chip aligner, a very high speed tester and
              polarization analyzer, and a workstation cluster for computational work.    
              The equipment supports the design, fabrication, and testing of communications
              and network interface components including serial optoelectronic and wireless
              hybrid integrated interfaces, parallel network interfaces, and wave-division
              multiplex interfaces.  ***
