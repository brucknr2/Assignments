Abstract    :
              9413272  Vahdani  The Guam earthquake of August 1993, Richter magnitude 8.1,
              caused  soil liquefaction and lateral spreading near the shorelines of  the
              island, about 40 miles north of the epicenter.  Liquefaction  and lateral
              spreading occurred in several areas, including filled  areas in downtown Agena
              and the Apra Harbor, where the port  facilities for commercial containers and
              the U.S. Naval Station  are located.    The objective of this program is to
              collect settlement and  lateral movement data in all areas that experienced
              significant  soil liquefaction.  This appears to be the first time that soil 
              liquefaction and lateral spreading have been observed at sites  underlain by
              coral sand.  Liquefaction-related data at these  sites is especially relevant
              to seismic hazard studies at other  sites underlain by coral sand.  ***
