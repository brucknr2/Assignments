Abstract    :
              The research in theoretical gravitational physics will  include:         The
              role of short distance physics in black hole  radiation via the Hawking process
              and in particle production  in an expanding universe;         Observational
              limits on, and theoretical properties  of, higher derivative effective actions
              for the  gravitational field;         Black hole thermodynamics for such
              effective actions;         The effort to identify a statistical origin for
              black  hole entropy;         Cutoff models for spacetime structure via the
              algebra  of quantum field operators and causal networks;    Results of this
              research should lead to a better  understanding of the sensitivity of particle
              production in  gravitational fields to unknown short distance physics, 
              possible corrections to the Einstein equations, and of the  nature and range of
              validity of the laws of black hole  thermodynamics.  The research may also lead
              to predictions  following from the existence of a fundamental short-distance 
              cutoff on physical degrees of freedom, and/or yield insights  valuable in
              attempts to supplant the continuum model of  spacetime by a finitistic one.
