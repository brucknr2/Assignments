Abstract    :
              9413854  Aggarwal          The acquired equipment  will serve as a testbed for
              research on various aspects of distributed computing using high bandwidth
              interconnections.    There are three components to the proposed research:
              interfacing workstations to high bandwidth networks using custom interfaces;
              development of systems software to capitalize on the high-speed links; and
              exploration of applications that exploit the capabilities of the high bandwidth
              network.  The equipment to be acquired includes high-end workstations, custom
              interface components for fiber-optic based high-speed links, and video/audio
              peripherals for multi-media applications.         Specific projects involving
              the research testbed are: (1) physical interface design to the high-speed
              links, design of low-level protocols for kernel level communication primitives
              and  the development of the necessary operating systems services for reliable
              distributed computing; (2) design of software to implement  a distributed
              shared memory environment for parallel computing; (3) investigation of a new
              paradigm for client/server computing using a set of tightly coupled
              coordinating processes; (4) investigation of various aspects of information
              retrieval and browsing in distributed  databases; and (5) exploration of issues
              in meeting real-time constraints  for distributed applications such as
              multi-media conferencing and  rendering of scenes using distributed ray
              tracing.   ***
