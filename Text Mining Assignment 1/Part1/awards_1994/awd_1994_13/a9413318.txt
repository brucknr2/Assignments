Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9413318  P.I.:  Wasan, Darsh T. (Illinois Institute of Technology)
                     The project will support the travel of four distinguished foreign
              engineers and scientists to come to the U.S. to participate in a symposium on
              thin liquid films at the AICHE annual Meeting and to visit U.S. universities to
              give seminars and to encourage collaboration..    Many of the key researchers
              in thin liquid films are from outside the U.S.  To assist U.S. workers in the
              field, the project brings four of the eminent engineers and scientists in the
              field to the U.S.  All funds are used for these participant costs.  The foreign
              visitors are featured at a symposium of two sessions at the 1994 AICHE Annual
              Meeting at San Francisco in November.  The sessions are arranged and chaired by
              the P.I.'s, who are leading U.S. researchers in the field of thin liquid films
              and the effects of these films on the stability of foams and emulsions.  The
              proper characterization of this stability is a key factor in much
              pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and other chemical processing.  Visits of the
              foreign researchers to U.S. universities are arranged as part of this project.
