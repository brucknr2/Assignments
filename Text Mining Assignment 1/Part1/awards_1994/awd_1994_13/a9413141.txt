Abstract    :
              9413141  Murdoch  This award to an outstanding group of ecologist and 
              geographers will support a multi-disciplinary training  program focused on
              spatial aspects of terrestrial, marine  and freshwater ecosystems.  The
              research programs of the 12  faculty members span small to global spatial
              scales in  studies of natural, exploited and managed systems, ranging  from
              individual populations to ecosystems.  In the context  of the training program,
              faculty will aim for a synthesis of  two approaches: that of the analysis of
              underlying  mechanisms responsible for the dynamics of ecological  systems, and
              that of the analysis of patterns over a large  range of spatial scales.  The
              award will support the  training of undergraduate and graduate students in both
               theoretical and experimental approaches combined with  instruction in the use
              of current modeling techniques.  Instruction will involve a combination of
              coursework,  seminars, and workshops; students will also have the  opportunity
              to participate in an industrial internship  program that are integral to the
              activity.    This award is also supported by the Geography and Regional 
              Science Program.  ***
