Abstract    :
              9413942  Barkatt  This is an award to provide support for purchase of equipment
              to  be used in conducting research on environmental conditions that  result in
              degradation of materials when they are subjected to  stress caused by
              environmental pollutants.  Project targets for  study include fiber-reinforced
              plastics that are used in road and  building construction, conditions that
              result in the deposition  of corrosion products in industrial boilers and
              power-producing  steam generators, and glasses that are being studied for 
              potential use in the immobilization of radioactive wastes.    This proposal was
              submitted in response to the Instrumentation  Development and Acquisition
              Solicitation, NSF 93-172, Academic  Research Infrastructure Program.  Results
              of this award are  expected to improve the accessibility of modern research 
              instrumentation for use by this institution's faculty in  educating students
              and in conducting research on important topics  of environmental significance.
