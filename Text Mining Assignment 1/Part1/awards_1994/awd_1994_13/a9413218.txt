Abstract    :
              9413218  Monson    This award will support a training program for undergraduate,
              graduate and  postdoctoral students with a focus on biosphere/atmosphere
              interactions across  several spatial scales.  This area of research plays a
              central role in  understanding the impact of the environment on ecosystems at
              several different  levels of organization.  Greater understanding of the
              mechanisms of trace gas  emission and of their influence on the environment
              will be emphasized.  The  group of faculty is drawn primarily from the
              University of Colorado, but  includes several staff from the National Center
              for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)  and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
              Administration (NOAA) facilities in  Boulder.  The training program includes
              courses and fieldwork, workshops and  internships at the NOAA and NCAR labs. 
              The training will expose students to  both theory and measurement, the latter
              using some unique equipment.  Besides  student support, the award will enable
              purchase or construction of unique  research equipment and will cover some
              costs of student research, travel and  publication.    This award is also being
              supported by the Atmospheric Chemistry Program in the  Division of Atmospheric
              Sciences.  ***
