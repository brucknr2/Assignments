Abstract    :
              9413163  Quay  This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean Circulation 
              Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP).  The  PI will
              carry out part of the sampling for Carbon 14 on WOCE lines  I8S and I9S, which
              are essentially meridional lines along 115  degrees east, and 85 to 95 degrees
              east between about 30 degrees  South and the Antarctic Continent.  In addition,
              the PI will  participate with other WOCE scientists in analyzing, interpreting 
              and publishing the data.  Specific objectives include study of the  deep water
              circulation in the western South Australia Basin, and  the formation of
              subantarctic Mode Water.
