Abstract    :
                This award provides partial support for three political methodology
              conferences in the period 1994-1996, organized by officers of the Political
              Methodology Section of the American Political Science Association.  The
              National Science Foundation has cosponsored these summer methodology meetings
              since 1986.  Each meeting will bring together about three dozen political
              methodologists, drawn roughly equally from the ranks of senior faculty, junior
              faculty, and advanced graduate students, to present, discuss, and evaluate new
              work at the methodological frontier of political science.    The experience of
              the past decade demonstrates that these special meetings not only provide an
              important forum for scientific communication, but also serve to stimulate the
              production of new science.  In most areas of political science, scholars have a
              choice of outlets for presenting their work.  But in the field of political
              methodology, the summer meetings are the only forum in which a critical mass of
              technical expertise and support is available to scholars on a regular basis. 
              The existence of this critical mass provides a crucial impetus to research at
              the frontier of political methodology.
