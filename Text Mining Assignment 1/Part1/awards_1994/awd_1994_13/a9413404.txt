Abstract    :
              Optical intensity fluctuations of the solar disc have been  investigated in the 
              frequency range from 20 Hz to 15 kHz  over a number of years with a detection 
              system capable of  detecting fluctuations on the order of 10-9 times the solar 
              constant. One important transient which may be recorded in  this frequency band
              are  high flying insects crossing the  angular diameter of the solar disc as
              seen by the  small  detector. Tests have shown that this detector is capable of
               detecting individual insects from the meter range to beyond  the kilometer
              range. The purpose of the planned research  will be to determine if this
              method, of optical remote  sensing, may  be used to identify the species of
              individual  air borne insects. The cross correlation  of the power  spectra of
              insect species will be used to determine the  accuracy and potential of this
              method.
