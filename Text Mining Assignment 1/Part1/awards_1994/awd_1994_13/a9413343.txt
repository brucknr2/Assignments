Abstract    :
              9413343  Self  This award provides funds to permit Dr. Stephen Self, Department 
              of Geology and Geophysics, University of Hawaii, to plan and  conduct with Dr.
              Raymundo S. Punongbayan, Mr. Ronnie C. Torres,  and Dr. Eddie Listanco,
              Philippine Institute of Volcanology and  Seismology (PHIVOLCS), the
              U.S.-Philippines First International  Decade Volcano Workshop on Taal, Luzon,
              Philippines.  Support is  provided for 10 U.S. scientists who are specialists
              in relevant  areas of geology in addition to the aforementioned U.S. and 
              Philippine coordinators.  Some 24 other Philippine participants  are supported
              from other sources.  The workshop will bring  together international and local
              expertise in a multidisciplinary  approach to volcanological problems inherent
              in Taal volcano.   These problems include andesitic caldera magmatism,
              incremental  growth of large calderas, turbulent large-volume pyroclastic 
              flows, phreatomagmatic eruptions and base surges, monitoring of  active Volcano
              Island and the potentially active caldera, and  influence of regional tectonic
              strain on volcanism and caldera  development.    The Decade Volcano Workshop on
              Taal is timely and fits well into  the goals of the International Decade for
              Natural Disaster  Reduction.  Taal volcano was designated as a "Decade
              Volcano,"  one of 12 to 15 worldwide, because its attributes are regarded as 
              the most dangerous among some 200 Philippine volcanoes.  These  attributes
              include frequent activity, greatest number of elements  at risk, high
              population density in the region, excellent  accessibility, and a complicated
              and little understood  volcanology.  The PI and the Philippine Coordinators
              have  excellent reputations for their research in the field of this  proposal. 
              This project is relevant to the objectives of the East  Asia and Pacific
              Program which seeks to increase the level of  cooperation between U.S. and
              developing country scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific
              information, ideas,  skills, and techniques a nd through collaboration on
              problems of  mutual interest and benefit.  ***
