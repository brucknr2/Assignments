Abstract    :
              Fine roots are an important component of the carbon and nutrient  budgets of
              terrestrial ecosystems.  Recent developments in  microvideo image analysis have
              made it possible to quantify fine  root production, longevity and mortality for
              the first time  under natural and experimental field conditions.  Studies have 
              shown that the root systems of plants are dynamic and responsive  to changing
              atmospheric CO2 concentrations, soil temperature,  and soil nitrogen
              availability.  Man-caused deposition of N is a  significant environmental
              concern over industrial regions of the  Earth, and increasing atmospheric CO2
              and soil temperatures are  central facets of changing global environments.   
              Because of our ability to quantify fine root demography, it is  now possible to
              better understand the effects of atmospheric  CO2, soil temperature and soil
              nitrogen availability on plant  root dynamics and ecosystem-level feedbacks. 
              Understanding the  flux of carbon and nitrogen from root systems to soil and
              soil  microbes is a critical aspect of global change in terrestrial 
              ecosystems.  This proposal attempts to justify NSF support for  acquisition of
              instrumentation to quantify effects of global  change on plant root, and
              ecosystem processes.
