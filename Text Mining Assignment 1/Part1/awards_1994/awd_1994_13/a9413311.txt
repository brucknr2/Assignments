Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports U.S.- Western European collaboration in logic
              programming.  The investigators are Evan Tick, University of Oregon, Andrew
              King, University of Southampton in the United Kingdom, Peter Van Roy, Max
              Planck Society, and Manual Hermenegildo, Technical University of Madrid.  They
              propose research on  three topics in the analysis and implementation of
              concurrent logic programming: design of  common intermediate language for
              high-level concurrent language compilers; design of partitioning algorithms for
              high-level concurrent languages; and design of execution models for concurrent 
              logic languages.  Practical engineering solutions to problems in compilation,
              optimization, and runtime execution will be emphasized.  The U.S. and European
              investigators bring to this collaboration complementary expertise in the
              implementation of logic programming languages.  The project takes advantage of
              European resources and investment in studies on techniques for abstract
              interpretation and its application to problems of parallel execution of logic
              programming.  Their collaboration will advance understanding of the application
              of logic programming to parallel programming.
