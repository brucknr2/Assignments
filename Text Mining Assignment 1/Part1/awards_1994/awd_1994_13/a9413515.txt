Abstract    :
              9413515  Ostriker    This award is for the acquisition of a massively parallel,
              scalable parallel computer. The planned computer will allow development and
              running of computer codes at Princeton and, for those problems requiring a more
              powerful computer, running the same codes at a supercomputing center.    The
              research supported by this computing platform consists of the numerical study
              of hydrodynamics. The application areas to be studied are aerodynamics,
              turbulence research, and structure formation in the universe. These application
              areas are typical of computational grand challenges requiring substantial
              computational resources to solve.  ***
