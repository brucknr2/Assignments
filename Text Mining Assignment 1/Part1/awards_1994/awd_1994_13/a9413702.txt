Abstract    :
              A near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) will be designed and constructed
              to study samples in the temperature range 10 K to 400 K. Light in the
              wavelength region 1500 to 400 nanometer range will be channeled down a
              fiber-optic wave guide to a tapered end with an aperture of size 20 to 200
              nanometers positioned just above the sample surface. The NSOM is capable of
              resolution more than an order of magnitude smaller than the diffraction limit
              and is the only optical technique capable of probing structures with features
              on a scale much less than 1 micrometer. The NSOM will be employed for the study
              of spatial variation of the current flow in high-temperature Josephson
              junctions. Defects near the junction interfaces cause inhomogeneous current
              flow, but the characteristics and distribution of the defects are largely
              unknown. A second project will study the spatial dependence of the optical
              emmission from conducting polymer light-emitting diodes. The NSOM tip will act
              as a localized collector of light emitted from the sample.  A near-field
              scanning optical microscope will be developed to study spatial imhomogeneities
              on a scale much less than the diffraction limit of ordinary light. The
              microscope will operate in the temperature regime 10 K to 400 K and will be
              used to study the spatial variation of the electrical current in high
              temperature superconductor Josephson junctions and, secondly, the spatial
              variation of light emitted from conducting polymer light-emitting diodes.
