              manufacturing and design conference.  It will focus on the related 
              manufacturing science and technology, product design for  intelligent
              manufacturing, and university/industry/government  cooperative programs for the
              future.  It builds on the work of a  previous conference on the same subject
              areas.       The conference will provide a forum for the exchange of 
              knowledge, experience and information regarding the recent trends  and
              developments related to the intelligent factories of the  future.  Researchers
              from North America and Africa will share their  insights on the related
              technologies.
