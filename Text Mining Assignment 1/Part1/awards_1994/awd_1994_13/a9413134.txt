Abstract    :
              9413134  Sparks  Low frequency but high magnitude disturbance events such as
              severe fires or floods are key factors structuring many ecosystems (Grime,
              1979; Huston, 1979; Picket & White, 1985; sparks et al., 1990).  the 1993 flood
              on the Upper Mississippi River provides a rate opportunity to investigate the
              impact of such an event on the components and processes of a large river
              floodplain ecosystem.  The recurrence interval of a flood equivalent to that of
              1993, which was of exceptionally long duration (March to October:  Figure1),
              has been  variously estimated at 100-500 years by the Army Corps of Engineers
              and the US Geological Survey.  Although it is acknowledged that nutrient supply
              is usually the main limiting factor governing primary productivity, the
              nutrient dynamics of riverine wetlands has been relatively little studied. 
              Large floods of long duration will affect nutrient dynamics of the floodplain
              in a number if ways. they will deposit sediment rich in organic matter, but
              will  also increase the rates of processes such as denitrification which will
              lead to a loss of nutrient from the system.  Flooding will also change the
              vegetational composition to that of an early successional state:  the rates of
              soil processes are strongly influenced by the species composition of the plants
              growing in them.  There are few data on nutrient dynamics of large rive
              floodplains, and even less for large rivers with a substantial part of their
              floodplain still intact,.  %%%  We propose to investigate the effects of the
              1993 flood in the nutrient dynamics of the floodplain by comparing the nutrient
              content and rates of soil processes of a range of sites which were inundated by
              the flood to a different extent.  The 1993 flood provides a unique research
              opportunity.  We propose to cooperate with Dr. Jos Verhoeven (Utrecht
              University, The Netherlands) whose group is one of the leaders in research on
              wetland nutrient dynamics.
