Abstract    :
              9413782  Boult    This award will establish a  giga-op simulation/computation
              facility at Lehigh University to support research in signal and image
              processing; computer vision; parallel algorithm development; software systems
              research; and wave-model computations in microwave IC design/packaging, optical
              design and material studies.     The instrumentation acquired by this award
              includes an I/O server, a parallel compute server, a floating point server, a
              graphics server, and a high speed network.  ***
