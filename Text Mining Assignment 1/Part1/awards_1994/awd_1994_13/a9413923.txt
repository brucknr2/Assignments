Abstract    :
              9413923  Lewis       This award provides funds for a robotics assembly cell and 
              mobile vehicle testbed.  The equipment will be dedicated to the  advancement of
              robotics intelligent material handling technology.   The equipment consists of
              two Silicon Graphics servers, a MIMD  parallel processing computer, robotics
              equipment for the  intelligent materials handling cell, a mobile platform with
              arm, a  real-time digital control system, and distributed control  equipment. 
              This equipment will comprise the completion of two next  generation systems
              ready for technology transfer to industry:  the  Intelligent Material Handling
              Development Cell and the Real-Time  Digital Control System.  The objective of
              the research to be  performed using this equipment is to develop intelligent
              material  handling technology in unstructured environments.         The
              technology may improve United States global  competitiveness by providing
              robotics systems that do not need to  be explicitly retaught and reprogrammed
              as a result of minor  changes in environments or tasks.  This research
              represents  across-disciplinary effort that is con-sponsored by industry, 
              whichs will work with the university to steer the research and  commercialize
              the result.
