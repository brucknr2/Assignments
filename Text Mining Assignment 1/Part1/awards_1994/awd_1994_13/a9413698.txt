Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9413698  Eric Beckman    This proposal is for the partial
              replacement of  an exciting  MSL 300MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              instrument used for both liquids and solids, with an AMX 300MHz instrument
              manufactured by Bruker.  The magnet, preamplifiers and high power amplifiers of
              the existing instrument will be retained, while the console, computer, and disk
              drives will be replaced.  Further, new probeheads will be acquired.    The
              MSL300 instrument while vital to many research programs ongoing at the
              University, has reached the point where maintenance costs have become
              prohibitively expensive because of the frequent need for repairs and
              replacement of parts.  Further, obtaining the right parts has itself become
              increasingly difficult.  Finally, the manufacturer does not provide new
              software for this type of instrument, as it does for newer models.    The main
              areas of research currently underway involve materials synthesis, processing of
              heavy molecules (particularly coal and petroleum resid, individually or in
              co-processing schemes), and catalysis, including characterization of catalysts.
               The NMR analyses play an essential role in the structural studies of
              materials, products, and catalysts, in determinations of mechanism, in kinetic
              studies of reactions, and in the development of various processes, and is the
              only instrument with MAS capability (i.e. which can analyze solid samples) in
              Pittsburgh.  Research which currently employs the NMR is sponsored by NSF, DOE,
              EPA, DOD, and a number of industrial concerns, including local companies such
              as Miles, Calgon, and Westinghouse.    In 1994, sixteen graduate students,
              working under the supervision of the Principal Investigators on this proposal,
              need to use the NMR instrument in their research.  In addition to supporting
              their research projects, unique instruments such as the MAS-NMR provide
              invaluable training experiences for graduate and undergraduate students.  From
              1990 to the present, the Co-PI has been the director of th e NMR facility,
              responsible for maintenance, repair, and user scheduling.  The current NMR
              instrument is in use at least six days per week and is made available to
              researchers both within and from outside the University.
