Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT          NSF support is requested for the purchase of a 600 MHz  NMR
              spectrometer for high  resolution structural studies of biological
              macromolecules  at Yale University.          Studies of macromolecular
              structure and function using  high-resolution solution NMR has  become a major
              activity for research groups in the  Departments of MB&B and Chemistry at Yale.
               The research  described below focuses on fundamental questions in  structural
              biology and  biochemistry involving metalloproteins (J. Coleman, L. Regan  and
              J. Caradonna), proteins and  protein-protein interactions (J. Prestegard and L.
              Regan),  RNA (D. Crothers and P. Moore),  membrane proteins (D. Engelman and S.
              Smith) and the  collection of datasets of proteins and RNA  for  methodological
              developments (A. Brunger).          Currently, this research is pursued on two
              500 MHz NMR  spectrometers. The plan is to  acquire a 600 MHz spectrometer to
              complement the existing  500 MHz instrumentation. The 600  MHz instrument will
              provide important and substantial  improvements in sensitivity, resolution and
              spectrometer  time available. The projects of the nine research groups 
              described below all have components that would benefit  markedly from the
              higher magnetic field.
