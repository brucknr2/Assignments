Abstract    :
              9413237  Eichele  This award will support a training program for undergraduate
              and graduate students that focuses on the use of invertebrate model systems to
              inform investigation of vertebrate development, and vice versa.  The relatively
              recent and surprising discovery that a series of genes that control development
              in drosophila have homologues with similar structure, function and organization
              in vertebrates has set the stage for this type of approach.  The 18 faculty
              associated with the program have basic research programs that study the
              development of a variety of vertebrates and invertebrates, including
              drosophila, nematode, slime mold, mouse, chicken and ferret; the group includes
              a few individuals at nearby institutions whose participation is expected to
              broaden the impact of the program.  The training will include existing,
              expanded and new course offerings, as well as lab rotations aimed at helping
              students become conversant with principles of vertebrate and invertebrate
              studies.  An annual two-day retreat will help build the program.  Students will
              be encouraged to undertake research that includes study of two organisms, one
              vertebrate and the other invertebrate.  This project represents a modern
              approach to training in one of the most exciting areas of modern biology.  ***
