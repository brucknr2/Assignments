Abstract    :
              Funds fron the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will  support the
              acquisition  of a Field Emission Transmission  Electron Microscope (FE-TEM), an
              instrument that is  specifically designed for high-resolution chemical
              analysis.  The FE-TEM will include basic specimen stages, an x-ray 
              flourescence spectrometer, a GATAN imaging filter, and a charge- 
              coupled-device (CCD) camera and associated hardware. The FE-TEM  will be
              employed in the study of: 1) structure and properties  of alloy and model
              composite interfaces; 2) the effect of  impurity segregation on the fracture
              mechanisms of  metal/ceramic interfaces; 3) structural and compositional 
              inhomogeneities in microwave ceramics; 4) the effects of  concentration
              gradients near grain boundaries on the properties  of electronic ceramics; 5)
              local structure and composition in  catalytic materials; 6) morphological
              development of  nanocrystalline ceramic composites from polymeric precursors; 
              7) chemistry/property relations at the interphase region in  polymer/ceramic
              composites; 8) polymer interfaces and capillary  wave formation.    A field
              emission transmission electron microscope with  associated peripheral hardware
              will be employed in the study of  materials. A diverse range of topics from
              composite interfaces,  fracture of metal/ceramic interfaces, microwave and
              electronic  ceramics, catalytic materials, polymer/ceramic composities, and 
              capillary wave formation at polymer interfaces will be studied.
