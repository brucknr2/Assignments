Abstract    :
              9413104  New Jersey Institute of Technology  Daniel Watts/ Norbert Elliot   
              Design and Development of Computer-Based Clean Manufacturing:  A Decision Tool
              for Industrial and Academic Use    The New Jersey Institute of Technology, in
              collaboration with MIT, will develop computer-aided tools to teach critical
              thinking methodologies and "clean" manufacturing processes.  This software will
              be design for use in freshman advanced courses and in the workplace to address
              reduction or elimination of pollutants and waste from manufacturing processes. 
              Industrial support and involvement in the project will be through the
              industrial members of the NSF I/UCRC Emission Reduction Research Center. 
              Industrial members will participate in project design and progress assessment.
