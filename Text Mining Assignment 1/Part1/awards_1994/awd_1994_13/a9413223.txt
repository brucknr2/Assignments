Abstract    :
              9413223  Lynch  This award renews support of a joint training effort by 14
              faculty who are members of the Department of Biology and who belong to one of
              three interdepartmental units (the Institutes of Molecular Biology,
              Neuroscience and Marine Biology) or to the Ecology and Evolution Program.  The
              theme of this RTG is molecular evolutionary biology.  The research and training
              are broadly focused on experimental and theoretical study of genetic
              mechanisms, developmental biology and population biology, all considered at the
              molecular level and all approached from an evolutionary standpoint.  The
              research programs of the faculty involve a diverse set of organisms including
              bacterial viruses, fungi, higher plants, drosophila, zebrafish, and other
              invertebrate and vertebrate animals.  Training activities involve students at
              the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels.  Undergraduates
              participate during both academic year and the summer term, generally during
              their junior and senior years.  Graduate student participants are recruited
              from first year students in any of the institutes or programs listed above. 
              Postdoctoral fellows are recruited through national advertising.  Besides
              research, training include an RTG colloquium featuring about 10 outside
              speakers each year, a journal club and a set of 4 courses in each of three
              areas: evolutionary, developmental and molecular biology.  Of the 12 courses, 5
              were developed for the RTG.  Graduate trainees are required to take 5 courses,
              including at least one course in each area.  All trainees are required to
              participate in the journal club and colloquium.  In addition to these, a new
              program of 3 day-long mini-symposia per year will begin in the renewal period. 
              Each symposium will involve 3 - 5 outside speakers and be preceded by a 3-4
              week journal club focused on the topic of the symposium.  ***
