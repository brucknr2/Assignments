Abstract    :
              9413105  Kreisler  This proposal requests three years of support for 2 faculty 
              members, 1 postdoctoral fellow and 2 graduate students to  continue the
              analysis of massive quantities of data accumulated  in studies of hyperon and
              heavy quark production in nucleon-  nucleon scattering at Brookhaven (BNL E766)
              and Fermilab (FNAL  E690).  These data were taken in 1986 and 1992
              respectively.  The  PI spent years developing and using the advanced electronic
               processors which allowed the collaboration to take and process  nearly 1010
              events.  They have recently finished studies of the  Lambda and Anti-lambda
              masses which have become the world  standard and an analysis of pion-pion
              correlations with  sufficient statistics to measure both the Bose statistical 
              effects and the coulomb interaction.  In the next grant period  they will
              concentrate on measuring hyperon polarization and light  meson spectroscopy. 
              They are exploring future applications of their data driven  processors in
              experiments at the DESY laboratory in Hamburg,  Germany and at the CERN
              laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.  ***
