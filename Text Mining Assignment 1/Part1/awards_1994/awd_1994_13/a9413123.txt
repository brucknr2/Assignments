Abstract    :
              9413123  Kaufman       Various direct model reference adaptive control (MRAC) 
              procedures developed by the proposed investigator is especially  attractive
              because they do not require full state feedback or  adaptive observers.  Other
              important properties of this class of  algorithms include (1) their
              applicability to non-minimum phase  systems, (2) the order of the plant may be
              much larger than the  order of the reference model, and (3) this approach
              considers  plants with multiple inputs and outputs.         However, it is
              important to note that in order to guarantee  asymptotic model following or
              even boundedness, it is sufficient to  demonstrate the satisfaction of a
              positive real type constraint.   Although various augmentation schemes have
              been developed to  alleviate this constraint, it is not straightforward to
              design the  needed (usually feedforward compensation to satisfy the positive 
              real condition over the desired (or a maximal) range of parameter  variations. 
              Thus, it is proposed to consider recent robust  compensation techniques that
              appear relevant to the design of such  compensation.  These include a robust
              feedforward compensator  developed for single input-single output adaptive
              systems which  will be extended to multiple input-multiple output systems and
              the  Kharitonvoc polynomial analysis, which will be considered for use  in
              single input-single output systems.         The resulting augmentation
              procedures from this proposed  effort in conjunction with the MRAC algorithms
              should result in  easily implementable procedures for designing and
              synthesizing very  robust direct adaptive controllers that are applicable to
              many  systems with significant uncertainty.  ***
