Abstract    :
              9413962  Sadayappan    This award is for the  acquisition of a mid-range
              scalable parallel computer to support a number of active research projects.
              Some of these projects focus on architectural issues, some on systems software
              issues, and others on the development and evaluation of parallel algorithms and
              applications. Besides facilitating several research  projects within the
              department, the machine will also aid in training graduate students in various
              disciplines pertaining to Computational Science and Engineering.    The
              following specific projects that will benefit from acquisition of the parallel
              computer are: (1) A Portable Parallel Programming Environment for
              Block-Recursive Numerical Algorithms, (2)Communication / Synchronization
              Mechanisms for Wormhole-Routed Systems, (3) Compiler Techniques for Efficient
              Execution of Array Statements on Distributed Memory Machines, (4) Intelligent
              Simulation of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems, (5) Large Scale Simulation of
              Oscillator Networks for Pattern Segmentation, (6) Parallel Algorithms for
              Volume Rendering, (7) Parallel Direct Sparse Matrix Algorithms for Distributed
              Memory Multiprocessors, (8) Routing and (9) Mapping on Distributed Memory
              Multiprocessors.  ***
