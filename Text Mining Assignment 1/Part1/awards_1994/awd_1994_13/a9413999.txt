Abstract    :
              A variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with  the capability
              of studying the chemistry of electronic material  design  and its application
              to nano-device fabrication will  be  acquired  with  the  Academic Research 
              Infrastructure  Program  funds.  The  JEOL STM instrument will operate between 
              30K  and  1500K.  The  research  will  emphasize  deposition  and  growth 
              reactions  involving silanes and chlorosilanes in an effort  to  elucidate  the
              role of hydrogen and chlorine atoms produced  by  the growth precursors. The
              variable-temperature capability will  play  an  important role in the study of
              adsorption,  diffusion  and growth reactions. The catalytic role of atomic
              hydrogen  in  promoting  ordered crystalline growth in electronic  materials. 
              Various  approaches will be considered in efforts to  fabricate  controllably
              doped diode nanostructures and quantum dots.    A  variable-temperature
              scanning tunneling microscope  will  be  utilized  in the study of the
              chemistry of electronic  material  design and its application to nanoscale
              device fabrication. The  role  of  atomic hydrogen and chlorine in the growth 
              processes  will  be  studied. Adsorption, diffusion, and  growth  reaction 
              studies will be carried out versus temperature. Efforts will be  made to
              fabricate nanoscale devices.
