Abstract    :
              Equipment will be purchased to develop a dedicated near-field  scanning optical
              microscope (NSOM) for the study of  semiconductor and biological systems with
              the assistance of the  Academic Research Infrastructure Program. The major
              components  are  NSOM control electronics and software, a spectrometer, DC  and
              high frequency probes, semiconductor parameter analyzer,  long wavelength
              detectors, a charge-coupled-device (CCD)  detector, an inverted microscope
              foundation and optics, and a  themoelectric mount and controller.  The NSOM
              laboratory will  be used to study: 1) sub-wavelength spectrocopic imaging of 
              optoelectronic devices; 2) semiconductor material  characterization from high
              resolution photoluminescence and  tuned excitation; 3) local heating
              determination under  operating conditions for optoelectronic devices with shear
               force microscopy; 4) fluoresence imaging of biological systems,  including
              chromophore tagged DNA array structures; 5) local  excitation and adsorption
              profiling of Bacteriorhodopsin to  determine structure and functionality in
              thin films; 6) basic  studies of new  types of spectroscopy possible with large
               momentum of the evanescent fields in the near-field regime.    A near-field
              scanning optical microscope will be developed for  the study of semiconductor
              and biological systems. The  semiconductor work will concentrate on the study
              of  optoelectronic systems such as solid state lasers, while the  biological
              work will study chromophore tagged DNA structures  and thin films of
              Bacteriorhodopsin.
