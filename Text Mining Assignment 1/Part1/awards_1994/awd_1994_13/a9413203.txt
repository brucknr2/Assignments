Abstract    :
              9413203  Walker  Luther Northwestern Theological Seminary requests support from 
              NSF for connection of its campus network to NSFNET.  They will  contract with
              MRNet for delivery of Internet services including a  connection to NSFNET.    
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access
              supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to
              implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty research will
              benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for the school to
              explore innovative  educational resources.
