Abstract    :
              Asper  9413809  This award provides support for the acquisition of
              instrumentation to be used in the study of biological, chemical and geological
              particle flux in the marine environment.  The primary use of the system is
              anticipated to be study of "marine snow," or particulate matter.  While it is
              well known that marine particulates are an important agent in flux of many
              chemical species in the ocean, and thus a key element in understanding nutrient
              and other chemical cycling, the details of how these processes occur is not
              well understood.  The PI is one of the leading researchers in this field.  The
              specific instrumentation supported in this award is upgrades to the PI's
              existing, DepSCOR-supported "remotely operated vehicle," or ROV.  These
              upgrades significantly improve the capabilities of the ROV, providing
              sufficient thrust to allow its operation in ocean currents, providing precise
              navigation fo it, and providing portable laboratory systems for both system
              operation on "ships of opportunity" and for carrying out chemistry on samples
              collected during shipboard programs.  University of Southern Mississippi
              provides 30% cost sharing of the project, supported under the Advanced Research
              Initiatives program.  ***
