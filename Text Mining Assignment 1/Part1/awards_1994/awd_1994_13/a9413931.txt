Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase a "fluorimager," an imaging  detector for
              visualizing and measuring spots on gels,  membranes, TLC plates and other
              labeled biological  materials.  The scope of research for which the instrument 
              will be used includes analysis of DNA binding proteins  (transcription factors)
              whose function is to regulate  transcription of genes during normal cell growth
              an d  differentiation and during embryonic development, the study  of
              transcription factor interactions that result in  enhancement or suppression of
              gene expression, molecules  (CAMs) and human cytoskeletal proteins.  It also
              includes  the molecular and genetic basis for the generation of the  immune
              repertoire, analysis of experimental allergic  encephalomyelitis, the study of
              interaction between  lymphocytes and hematopoiesis, the constitutive expression
               of growth factor genes in the growth regulation of normal  epithelial and
              neuroectodermal cells, the study of the  mechanisms of regulation of innate
              resistance of natural  killer cells and phagocytic cells and the regulation
              through  cytokines of the differentiation and activity of DC4+ and  CD8+ T cell
              subsets, and the structure and conformation of  normal p53 protein.
