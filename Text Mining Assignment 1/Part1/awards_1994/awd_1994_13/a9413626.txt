Abstract    :
              proposal# 9413626  PI -  Ledford    The chemical analysis of mixtures is
              commonly required in chemistry, materials science, biotechnoloy, and
              environmental science.  If the application demands detection, identification,
              and quantification of more than a very few substances in a mixture, then
              chemical separation is usually required.   Most current methods of separation
              are either very slow or are limited to only a small portion of the mixture. 
              The objective of this proposed  STTR research is to develop much faster
              instrumentation for the chemical analysis of moderately complex mixtures.   
              This research project will develop a rugged instrument for commercial
              application.  The instrument will detect, identify, and quantitate volatile
              organic substances in mixtures containing about one hundred components within
              five minutes or less.  Commercial applications include engine emissions
              analysis and rapid environmental screening.
