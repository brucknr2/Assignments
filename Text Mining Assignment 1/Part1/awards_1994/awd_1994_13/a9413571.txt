Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR) Phase I
              research project is to fabricate, demonstrate, and characterize a high
              resolution, high efficient imaging time-of-flight nanoprobe which uses high
              repletion femtosecond postionization techniques.  Successful completion of this
              new instrument will make it possible to quantify the spatial distribution of
              atomic and molecular species in semiconductors, optical fibers, biological
              specimens, environmental and others samples, to subfemtomole concentration
              levels.
