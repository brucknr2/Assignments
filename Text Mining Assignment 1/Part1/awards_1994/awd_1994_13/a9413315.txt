Abstract    :
              9413315  Rubin  The PIs wish to extend existing U-Th disequilibrium technique to
               date young MORBS by pursuing an internal isochron method.  The  internal
              isochron method relies on obtaining different isotopic  ratios of the matrix
              and phenocryst phases in the same rock.  They will also combine the U/Th-series
              nucleides with  "traditional geochemistry" to obtain an insight into the
              crustal  accretion process.  ***
