Abstract    :
              9315927  Blake  9413295  Aronson  This award supports a study of echinoderm
              fossils from the Eocene  La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island in the Antarctic
              Peninsula.   This formation represents shallow marine conditions and it 
              contains one of the most diverse fossil echinoderm assemblages in  the world. 
              The Seymour Island echinoderm fauna has  characteristics more like Paleozoic
              echinoderm communities than  like the great majority of other Cenozoic shallow
              water  communities.  Current thinking suggests that morphologically  novel
              marine organisms originated primarily in near shore,  heterogeneous
              environments, and then expanded to offshore, more  homogeneous environments. 
              After the Paleozoic, this pattern of  near shore-offshore pattern is thought to
              have been driven  largely by predation pressure.  The La Meseta echinoderm 
              occurrences suggest that the community reorganization that began  in the
              Mesozoic may not have been completed until the early  Cenozoic.  This research
              will extend the taxonomic work on the  echinoderms from Seymour Island and it
              will evaluate the  significance of predation in stelleroid and crinoid
              populations.   This information will allow a comparison with other echinoderm 
              occurrences, both fossil and modern, and will provide a rare view  of
              echinoderm paleoecology.  Specifically, this research will  allow an important
              test of the hypothesis that predation pressure  in shallow-marine near-polar
              environments during the Eocene was  an important forcing mechanism for
              echinoderm communities.  ***
