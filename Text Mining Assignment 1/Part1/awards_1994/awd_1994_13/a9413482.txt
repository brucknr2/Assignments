Abstract    :
              9413482  Friedman  This is a request for partial support for the travel of a
              U.S.  delegation to the Assembly and Administrative Council of the 
              International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering  (IFMBE).  The
              Council will meet in conjunction with the World  Congress on Medical Physics
              and Biomedical Engineering and the  International Union for Physical and
              Engineering Sciences in  Medicine (IUPESM) on August 21-26, 1994 in Rio de
              Janeiro,  Brazil.    The U.S. will be represented by a delegation of the
              American  Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE).  AIMBE  is
              intended to be a unifying organization for medical and  biological engineering
              in the U.S.  It is essential that the U.S.  be well represented at the IFMBE's
              International meeting (held  only once, every three years), and it is
              especially appropriate  for the AIMBE to play a major role in such
              representation.  ***
