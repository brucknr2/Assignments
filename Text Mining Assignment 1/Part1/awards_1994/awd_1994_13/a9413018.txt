Abstract    :
              9413018  Williams    With this grant from The National Science Foundation, Dr.
              Sloan  Williams will develop models which will allow her to reconstruct  forms
              of prehistoric social organization using DNA data obtained  from the analysis
              of ancient bone. In the course of  archaeological fieldwork in southern Peru,
              Dr. Williams and her  collaborators have excavated a series of cemeteries which
              contain  well preserved human skeletal remains. The graves also yielded 
              numerous burial goods which provide information on the social and  occupational
              status of the associated individuals. Using current  biochemical techniques it
              is possible to extract and analyze DNA  from these bones and with the data thus
              collected determine the  degree of relatedness among individuals. On this basis
              it should  be possible to reconstruct biological affinity and relate this to 
              social and occupational organization.    DNA analysis has provided a valuable
              research tool in many areas  of science and is permitting researchers not only
              to answer old  questions with greater precision, but also to expand the 
              boundaries of potential inquiry. Because ancient bone sometimes  preserves DNA
              it may permit archaeologists also to venture into  new realms. Dr. Williams is
              breaking new ground in this  direction. Her research is important not only for
              what it may  reveal about Peruvian prehistory, but also because the techniques 
              she develops may be useful in a wide range of archaeological  situations.
