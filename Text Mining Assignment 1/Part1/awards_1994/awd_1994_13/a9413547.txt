Abstract    :
              9413547  Plank       This award provides 47 per cent of the funding required 
              for the acquisition and installation of an inductively  coupled plasma mass
              spectrometer (ICP-MS) system to be  installed and operated in the Department of
              Geology at the  University of Kansas. The University of Kansas is committed  to
              providing the remaining funds necessary to complete the  project. The ICP-MS
              will be operated as a multi-user  facility dedicated to trace element and
              isotopic analysis in  a variety of geological materials for research and
              teaching  purposes. The instrument is uniquely capable of measuring a  large
              number of elements in the periodic table with high  precision, high
              sensitivity, and rapid throughput. The  University of Kansas and regional
              users' applications of ICP-  MS will include research in groundwater flow,
              water-rock  interactions in aquifers, mantle melting, rock-fluid  partitioning,
              carbonate diagenesis, and the study of fluid  inclusions.  ***
