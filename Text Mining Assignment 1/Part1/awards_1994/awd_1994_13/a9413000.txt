Abstract    :
                    9413000  Peter Rodman     The goal of primate ecological studies is to
              identify the  enviornmental pressures that shape primate societies and the 
              behavior of individuals living in them.  Most often, they  seek to relate the
              foraging strategies, reproductive  decisions, and social behavior of
              individuals to underlying  ecological variables such as the availability and 
              distribution of food resources,    This very sophisticated study of a rare
              South American  monkey will provide information on these issues relating to 
              the distribution and availability of food, but it will also  test the
              soco-ecological importance of other food resource  characteristics such as
              their size and shape, chemical  composition, toughness, and processing time. 
              The data will  also permit the first field test of an ecological model of 
              fission-fusion sociality developed in studies of other  related monkeys.   
              Furthermore, these monkeys appear to be a good indicator  species for judging
              the effects of human disturbance on  tropical ecosystems, and therefore the
              results of this study  should prove directly important to issues of
              conservation in  Amazonian South America.
