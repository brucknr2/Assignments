Abstract    :
              9413174  Chereskin  In this project, the PI will use a shipboard Acoustic
              Doppler  Current Profiler (ADCP) to measure vertical profiles of currents 
              beneath the ship as it collects hydrographic and tracer data along  a zonal
              section at latitude 8 degrees North, and on a second line  between Indonesia
              and Australia.  These lines are designated as  lines I-1 and I-10,
              respectively, and are components of the U.S.  contribution to the World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE)  Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE).  The focus of
              these observations  will be on general circulation and property fluxes in the
              Indian  Ocean and through its connections to the Pacific and Atlantic  Oceans.
