Abstract    :
              9413046  Bellan  This proposal calls for an investigation of the linkage between
               orbit stochasticity, a microscopic effect, and macroscopic  properties of the
              plasma.  In particular the investigator will  look for a flattening of the
              distribution function and a  reduction of fluid response to the drift wave in
              the plasma.  The  technique used will involve laser induced fluorescence.  In a
               more sophisticated application of the fluorescence technique,  optical tagging
              will be used to allow tracking the trajectories  of specific subgroups of ions.
