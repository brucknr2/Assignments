Abstract    :
              9413372  Johnston, David    This Academic Research Infrastructure
              (Instrumentation) award is  made to provide partial support for the acquisition
              of a  Constructed Infrastructure Testing System.  Research using the  new
              system will emphasize the integrated aspects of constructed  Civil
              Infrastructure Systems in the areas of structures,  pavements, geotechnical and
              construction.  Coupling and  environmental issues in large test specimens can
              be better  studied with such a test as compared to small specimens in 
              individual tests.  ***
