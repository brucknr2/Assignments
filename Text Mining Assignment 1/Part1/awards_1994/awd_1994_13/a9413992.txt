Abstract    :
              9413992  Sanchez-Sinencio    This award supports the acquisition of
              computational and instrumentation equipment to support research in VLSI
              implementation of High Performance Communications and Signal Processing
              systems.     The research supported by this instrumentation includes Receiver
              and Coding algorithms for Fading Channels, Wavelets for Efficient Signaling,
              Speech Data Compression for Mobile Communication Systems, and Signal Processing
              in Physical Systems.  ***
