Abstract    :
              9413273  Iwan  The Northridge earthquake of January 17, 1994 yielded what  may
              prove to be the most valuable set of strong motion data  ever obtained from an
              earthquake.  These data include the  largest horizontal ground motion ever
              recorded.  The damage  associated with these large ground motions is well 
              documented.    In some of the near-field accelerograms, particularly the 
              Sylmar station, there is evidence of a significant long  period displacement
              pulse in the ground motion.  The  existence of such motion has recently been
              the subject of  great concern as it relates to the design of base isolated  and
              high-rise structures. These structures are particularly  susceptible to large
              input displacements.  There is a  recognized need to better understand the
              nature of this long  period motion and, ultimately, to be able to model and 
              predict is occurrence.    Present routine techniques for the processing of
              strong  motion data tend to remove or distort the long-period  information from
              recorded accelerograms.  However, under a  recent NSF exploratory grant,
              techniques have been developed  to recover much of the long-period information
              in  accelerograms.  This is accomplished by nontraditional  baseline correction
              and signal processing that is based on  an improved understanding of the
              physics of the ground  motion and the nature of the recording instruments. The 
              techniques have been verified for ground motions from the  Landers earthquake. 
                The goal of this research program is to apply the recently  developed data
              processing techniques to a suite of  earthquake records from the Northridge
              earthquake.  The  ultimate goal is to provide a basis for guidelines that may 
              be used to characterize the long-period content of  earthquake motion for
              structural design.  This exploratory  investigation addresses the following
              questions:    1.  What is the nature of the long period (displacement)  content
              of ground motion from this type of thrust  earthquake?    2.  How does this
              vary with distance from th e epicenter and  orientation with respect to the
              fault plain.    3.  How is the long-period content (peak displacement)  related
              to the short-period content (peak acceleration)?    4.  What generalizations
              can be made to future events of  this, or another, type?    5.  Is there a
              correlation between the observed long-period  ground motion and structural
              damage?    The research is based on digital data obtained from the  California
              Division of Mines and Geology and the U.S.  Geological Survey.  ***
