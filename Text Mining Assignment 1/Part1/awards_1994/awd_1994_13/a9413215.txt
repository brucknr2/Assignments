Abstract    :
              9413215  Ewens    This award provides support for an interdisciplinary training 
              program in computational aspects of modern genetics.  Topical  areas include
              algorithm development, molecular evolution,  sequence alignment, statistical
              inference, and other aspects of  biological informatics.  These areas are
              central to one of the  most multidisciplinary approaches to modern biology. 
              The faculty  group includes 19 investigators from the departments of computer 
              and information science in the school of engineering, the  departments of
              mathematics and biology in the school of arts and  sciences, and the
              departments of genetics and human genetics in  the school of medicine.  The
              group includes junior and senior  investigators, several of international
              reputation.  The training  program will center around 8 new or existing core,
              additional new  elective courses, a journal club and seminars.  Students are 
              expected to enter with backgrounds in computer science,  mathematics or
              biology. Training will emphasize molecular  biology, and genetics, computer
              science, statistics and  probability, but will be tailored to the needs of
              individual  students and an optional industrial internship program is  planned.
                 This award is also being supported by the Computational Biology  Activity
              and by the Database Activity in the Biological Science,  both in the Division
              of Biological Instrumentation and Resources.  ***
