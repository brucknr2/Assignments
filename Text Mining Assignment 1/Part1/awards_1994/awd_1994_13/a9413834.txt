Abstract    :
              Broecker  9413834  This award supports the development of a "geochronology
              laboratory" at Columbia University, specifically to carry out dating using K-Ar
              and Ar39-Ar40 dating techniques.  The laboratory will be based around a new
              mass spectrometric system, and will be integrated into the existing noble gas
              laboratory at Lamont-Doherty Earth Obsepvatory.  It will include an all metal
              noble gas mass spectrometer with Faraday Cup and ion counting capability, as
              well as a gas extraction line with a resistance furnace and laser system for
              bulk and detailed sampling.  It will be applied to a broad range of
              applications including igneous petrology, stratigraphy, structural geology,
              geomorphology and paleoceanography, and will promote interdisciplinary research
              among the researchers at Lamont-Doherty and collaborators at other
              institutions.  Half of the funding for this facility will be provided by
              Columbia University, with the remainder provided by NSF through the Academic
              Research Infrastructure program.  ***
