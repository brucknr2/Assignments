              Institution will allow U.S. ocean scientists, especially  those in the academic
              research community, to participate in  activities of the International Council
              for the Exploration  of the Sea (ICES) which are of special interest to the
              ocean  sciences community, to the National Science Foundation and  other
              Federal agencies, and to ICES as well.  ICES is an  intergovernmental
              organization designed to coordinate  scientific research, management of
              fisheries, environmental  concerns, and oceanographic matters of common
              interest to  countries bordering the North Atlantic.  Under this award  U.S.
              academic research scientists will participate in  selected ICES activities
              which include the annual ICES  Statutory Meeting, meetings of ICES Working
              Groups, and  scientific workshops and planning meetings.
