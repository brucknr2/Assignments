Abstract    :
              9413383  Cameron  The present grant will support the design and procurement of a
               new injector synchrotron (CIS) to enhance the capabilities of the  existing
              synchotron and electron-cooled storage ring (the  Cooler).  The Cooler provides
              a unique capability in this country  to perform a class of experiments using
              thin internal targets in  the ring.  The CIS would increase stored beam
              intensity by an  order of magnitude, improve stability and ease of operation,
              and  reduce operating costs.  A number of important experiments will  benefit
              from or only be possible with CIS.  ***
