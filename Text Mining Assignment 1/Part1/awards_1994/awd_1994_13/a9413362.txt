Abstract    :
              9413362  Petrenko    This project is co-funded between the Condensed Matter
              Physics and  Polar Glaciology Programs.  The project will investigate the 
              characteristics and physical mechanisms of the photoplastic effect  (PPE) in
              ice:  pure and doped ice demonstrate significant and  persistent hardening
              under the action of ultraviolet illumination.   The fundamental mechanism of
              PPE in ice is not understood, and is  of importance from a fundamental solid
              state physics standpoint as  well as geophysical and environmental viewpoints. 
              Both laboratory  and field experiments will be conducted.  Emphasis will be
              placed  in microscopic processes which are studied by internal friction, 
              dislocation currents, conductivity and photoconductivity, etching  and
              replicating of dislocations emerging on the surface of the ice,  and
              spectroscopic study of photochemical products accumulating ice  under
              illumination.  The project also includes a modest theory  component.  The
              results are intended to determine the fundamental  mechanism of the PPE in ice,
              and whether or not ultraviolet solar  irradiation is essential in forming
              plastic properties of natural  ice and snow.    % % %    This project is
