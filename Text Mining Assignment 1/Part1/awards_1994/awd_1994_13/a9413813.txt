                                           ABSTRACT                                 
              AST-9413813  Levison, Hal    The PIs will acquire 6 state-of-the-art
              workstations that  will be linked together using a high-speed network to form a
               single, powerful, parallel-architecture computer, to be  called "Solar System
              Orbit Numerical Integrating Cluster' or  'SSONIC'.SSONIC will be dedicated to
              solving some of the  leading questions about the origin and evolution of the 
              Earth and other bodies in the solar system.    It has become increasingly
              apparent in the past 15 years  that small bodies such as comets and steroids
              played,  through accretionary processes, a fundamental role in the  formation
              and evolution of the Earth and planets.  After the  planets formed, asteroidal
              and cometary impacts profoundly  influenced the evolution of Earth's climate by
              i) providing  volatiles and organic materials and ii) causing long-term 
              climatic catastrophes. Understanding the dynamical evolution  of these bodies
              is required in order to fully understand  their effects on the Earth and other
              planets.    Until very recently, direct numerical simulations of the  dynamics
              of solar system objects over the timescales  necessary to study the formation
              process and long-term  evolution have been beyond normal computational reach. 
              However, due to recent advancements in computer hardware and  software, it is
              now possible to attack problems in solar  system dynamics which were
              intractable only two or three  years ago.    The SSONIC computing system will
              allow the PIs make  significant inroads in understanding the origin and 
              evolution of bodies in the Solar System like the Earth and  other planets.  ***
