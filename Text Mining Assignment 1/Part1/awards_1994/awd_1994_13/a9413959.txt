Abstract    :
              9413959  Pinkel  This award will provide funding to develop and install two 
              multidisciplinary research systems on the AGOR 24 (R/V Roger  Revelle) research
              vessel, currently under construction.  The  first will be a SeaSoar system
              which will purchased and modified  to maximize capabilities for biologic,
              chemical and physical  oceanographic sampling.  It will be able to profile the
              top 400 m  of the sea with 3  km horizontal and about 1 m vertical  resolution.
               The system will be used to measure fluorescence and  other biological tracers,
              physical forcing on organisms, and  micro- to meso-scale patterns and dynamics
              of plankton in various  marine environments.  The second system will be a Multi
              Scale  Doppler Sonar (MSDS).  This system will be developed to provide 
              sampling capabilities not currently available in commercial  systems.  It will
              consist of a nested pair of long range (60 kHZ)  and high resolution (160 kHz)
              sonars.  This system will be used  for studies of deep zooplankton populations,
              plankton vertical  migration, island upwelling processes, frontal hydrography
              and  water mass convection.  These systems will be available on the  R/V Roger
              Revelle for investigators procuring UNOLS ship-time.  The University of
              California, San Diego will provide matching  funds for this project, which is
              supported under the Academic  Research Infrastructure program.  ***
