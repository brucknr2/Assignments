Abstract    :
                Marine animals can have difficulties seeing well in the submarine environment,
              where light intensity, color range, and object contrast are all lower than in
              air.  Nevertheless many marine animals have excellent vision, and one of the
              most complex eyes known is the compound eye of a crustacean called the mantis
              shrimp.  This eye contains several classes of photoreceptors that include
              roughly 8 photopigments for color vision, another more than half dozen classes
              of polarization detectors, and a sensitive system of ultraviolet receptors. 
              This work takes new technology of electro-optical devices into the field to
              explore the properties of the visual world underwater, and to use behavioral
              activity to assess visual perception.  Using these animals as a model
              biological system, the work will clarify the evolution of visual adaptations
              for contrast enhancement and image analysis in difficult visual environments. 
              Results will have broad impact on visual neuroscience, neuroethology, and
              comparative evolutionary studies; will have relevance to studies of ecological
              habitat and water quality; and will be important for suggesting new engineering
              approaches to machine vision.
