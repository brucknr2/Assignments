Abstract    :
              9413787  Schwartz       This award provides partial funding for the acquisition 
              of portable geophysical field stations to be used in  research and teaching
              projects in tectonics, Earth  structure, and earthquake studies. The equipment
              of the  stations will consist of portable broad band digital  seismometers and
              their data acquisition systems,  and  receivers to be used in connection with
              the satellite-based  Global Positioning System. The geophysical field stations 
              will be stored and maintained by the Institute of Tectonics  at the University
              of California at Santa Cruz. The  University of California at Santa Cruz is
              committed to  providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition  of
              these field stations.  ***
