Abstract    :
              This grant supports an international symposium on Commonalty of  Phenomena in
              High Performance Composites at Rosemont, Illinois,  October 2-6, 1994.  The
              objective of this symposium is to examine  the state of our understanding in
              processing, microstructure, and  properties of high performance composites. 
              Composite materials  are very diverse:  different matrix materials different 
              reinforcements, different forms of reinforcements (fibers,  whiskers,
              particles), interfacial coatings, different  arrangements and distribution of
              reinforcements in a given  matrix, etc.  Notwithstanding such diversity, there
              is a myriad  of concepts, processes, methodologies of evaluation and 
              characterization that cut across different types of composites.  Researchers
              working in this areas with different composites  (polymeric, metallic,
              intermetallic and ceramic matrix composites  will attend.  Commonalty of
              phenomena in different types of  composites, such as the role of the matrix
              microstructure,  interface, toughening mechanisms, and fracture behavior are 
              discussed.  The technical papers will be peer-reviewed and  published.   
              Composite materials have potential applications as structural  components in a
              wide variety of industrial components.  Their use  has been limited by high
              cost and processing difficulties.  This  conference provides timely coverage of
              the latest research  concerning these materials.
