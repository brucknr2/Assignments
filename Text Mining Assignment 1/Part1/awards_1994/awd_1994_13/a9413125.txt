Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma in the purchase of a
              modern 400 MHz multinuclear  NMR Spectrometer.  This equipment will be used in
              the following areas of research:  (1)   Chiral transition metal complexes; (2) 
              Oxidation chemistry and biochemistry in the brain;  (3)  Liquid crystals and
              polymerized electrolyte gels; (4)  Catalytic asymmetric reactions;  (5) 
              Organotransition metal chemistry; (6)  Marine natural  products; (7) 
              Siderophores;  (8)  Synthesis, stabilization, and application of reactive or
              organic moieties; (9)  Nucleotide  analogs; (10)  Nitrosylmetalloporphyrins;
              and (11)  Divalent transport by polyether  ionophores.    Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify
              unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
