              Abstract  ATM-9413327  Hughes, Malcolm  University of Arizona  Title: A
              Multimillennial Temperature Reconstruction from Far  Northeastern Eurasia   
              There is a real possibility that a multimillennial tree-ring  chronology
              extending over most or all of the Holocene could be  built in far north-eastern
              Siberia.  This SGER award supports  exploratory field work and
              dendrochronological analysis of  subfossil material from Arctic - Siberia. 
              Experience with larch  trees elsewhere in Siberia strongly suggests that a
              valuable  reconstruction of summer temperatures could be derived from this 
              material.  This would form a key part of a network of high-latitude 
              temperature records, including tree-ring based constructions from  Scandinavia,
              the Polar Urals and Alaska, and ice-cores from  Greenland and other locations. 
              Such a chronology could also be  used to date subfossil wood from many
              locations within the region,  and hence to contribute to the study of northern
              treeline dynamics  through the Holocene.
