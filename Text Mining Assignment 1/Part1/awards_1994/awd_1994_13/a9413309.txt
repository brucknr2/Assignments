Abstract    :
                This project emphasizes practical as well as   theoretical aspects 
              surrounding the application and implementation of algorithms   for  computing 
              stationary probabilities of discrete Markov chains.  Special   attention is 
              devoted to applications in which discrete  models are used to   understand and 
              analyze the dynamics of large  systems comprised of a   collection of loosely 
              coupled subsystems  such as in the study of queuing models   and networks, 
              telecommunications, computer performance evaluation,   stochastic  automata 
              networks, and economic modeling and forecasting.      Algorithmic facets
              concern  the development and analysis of  parallel multilevel methods   based
              on  aggregation/disaggregation  techniques---both direct and   iterative--- and
              some  of these  techniques are applied to problems involving   stochastic
              automata  networks. An architectural aspect involves the identification   of 
              features of  vector and parallel computers that are best suited  for  
              implementing Markov  chain algorithms.    Theoretical components involve
              studying   properties of  Markov chains. These ideas are then used to  
              generate error  analyses aimed at understanding the convergence and stability  
               properties of  multilevel aggregation/disaggregation algorithms.
