Abstract    :
              9413067  Peterson    Description:  This project supports a U.S.  scientist to
              travel to Pakistan and collaborate  with scientists there on Pion-induced
              breakup  detection using track detectors.  Fragments of  nuclei after reactions
              with energetic pi mesons  will be measured with a reliable and efficient 
              detector system that requires a very time-  consuming and careful analysis. 
              The exposure  to the requisite pion beams will be carried out  in an optimal
              manner, in coordination with  skilled analysts in Pakistan.  The nuclear 
              excitation energy will be at levels where  traditional nuclear fission is
              preempted by  fast fragment production.  Nuclear targets of  middle mass will
              be selected to minimize the  role of fission in its traditional sense.   
              Scope:  The project involves Dr. R.J. Peterson,  from the Nuclear Physics
              Laboratory at the  University of Colorado, in Boulder, and a  Pakistani team
              headed by Dr. Hameed Ahmed Khan,  of the Solid State Nuclear Track Detector 
              Laboratory in PINSTECH, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.   The proposed work is part of a
              U.S.-Brazil-  Pakistan collaboration in the study of pion-  induced fission. 
              Past collaboration has  resulted in U.S. publication using data from  Pakistan
              and calculations from Boulder. This  grant is the first for the P.I. for the
              purpose  of enhancing this collaboration, and it meets  the criteria of the
              Division of International  Programs.  ***
