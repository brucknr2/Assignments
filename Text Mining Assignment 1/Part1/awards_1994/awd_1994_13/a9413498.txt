Abstract    :
                      9413498  Beebe  This Academic Research Infrastructure (Instrumentation)
              Program  award is for the partial support for acquiring a versatile Surface 
              Analysis System.  Twenty-eight faculty, approximately 62 graduate  students and
              numerous post-doctoral students will utilize this  equipment.  Research in
              advanced materials and processing, in the  biotechnology of surfaces, in the
              environmental issues of surfaces  and in combinations of these areas will be
              conducted with this  facility.  In addition to the research that this
              instrument will  primarily support, there are parallel uses in the research
              training  of both graduate and undergraduate students.  ***
