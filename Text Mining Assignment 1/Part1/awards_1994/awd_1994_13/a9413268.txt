Abstract    :
              CTS-9413268  Linda P. Cornell  University of Toledo    ABSTRACT    Research will
              be performed to optimize the design of a novel Cyclic Diffusional Separation
              (CDS) technology and evaluate its potential for separating proteins and other
              macromolecules.  The CDS process couples transient diffusion with cyclic
              convection in order to obtain sharp separations even for species with similar
              diffusivities.  Proof-of-principle experiments have been successful and
              theoretical modeling predicts that design optimization will further improve the
              performance.  Using a modified apparatus, the hydrodynamic and dispersion
              characteristics will be examined, and separation factors measured.  If
              successful, the technique will be useful for separating delicate chemicals and
              biochemicals from colloidal dispersions and macromolecular solutions.  There is
              potential for significant impact on bioprocessing and environmental technology.
