              Characterization of Moist  Convection in TOGA COARE    The award aims at
              characterizing the thermodynamics of convection  over the western Pacific warm
              pol.  The incloud thermodynamic data  collected by aircraft NCAR Electra and
              NOAA P3, will be utilized to  calculate accurately the parcel buoyancies,
              temperatures, and  condensed water content.  An attempt will be made to
              systematically  relate this information to the subcloud layer characteristics. 
               This type of analysis is important for cumulus parameterization in  climate
              models.
