Abstract    :
              9413037  Holmes  The research proposed in this application is concerned with 
              improving three-dimensional fluorescence microscope imaging  by further
              developing, refining, and evaluation of maximum  likelihood estimates (MLE)
              based on blind deconvolution  algorithms.  Specifically, the objectives are to
              further  extend, implement and test the MLE blind deconvolution  algorithms in
              ways that will provide superior noise  reduction over other deblurring
              algorithms, shorten  computation time and improve repeatability.  These 
              algorithms will be evaluated in a neurophysiolgical testbed.  Images will be
              reconstructed from biological cell systems  that are well studied by other
              means of imaging, but will  benefit from improved visualization of 3D
              microanatomy.  The  resulting 3D images will be evaluated for their ability to 
              display 3D structures that elucidate answers to specific  neurophysiological
              research questions.  ***
