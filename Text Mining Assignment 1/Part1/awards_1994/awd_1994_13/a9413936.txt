Abstract    :
              9413936  Slocum       This grant provides funds for the establishment of a high 
              speed high precision machining center, based on a scaled Ingersoll  Milling
              Machine Octahedral Hexapod machining center and a Brown &  Sharp Excel
              Coordinate Measuring Machine, in the Laboratory for  Manufacturing &
              Productivity at the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology.  The Hexapod
              machine has six degrees of freedom, and is  designed to be rigid and accurate,
              so it can perform many  manufacturing functions ranging from high speed milling
              of complex  molds for plastics and composites research, to composite tape 
              laying research.  The measuring machine will be used to measure  parts to
              verify cutting performance of the Hexapod. By working with  machine tool
              builders, this Center will help enable researchers in  the following areas to
              more effectively apply their research to  machine tools:  internal passive
              structural damper designs and  self-compensated water, hydrostatic bearings,
              precision temperature  control, precision magnetic bearing spindles, precision
              adaptive  controllers, and advanced high-efficiency, linear electric motors.   
                  The research will be applied to the Hexapod and Excel  mCMM in an effort to
              further increase their speed and accuracy,  which are critical parameters
              required by the United States machine  tool industry if it is to regain its
              world leadership position.
