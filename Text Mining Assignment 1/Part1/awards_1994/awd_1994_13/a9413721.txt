Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for the purchase of a 400 MHz NMR  spectrometer for the
              Department of Chemistry at the  University of Mississippi.  Acquisition of this
              spectrometer  will greatly enhance ongoing research programs in areas of 
              organic, inorganic, biochemistry, and biophysics within this  department.  The
              core user group requires a higher-field NRM  spectrometer with more advanced
              pulse techniques than is  currently available in the Department of Chemistry to
              extend  our studies involving large molecules such as proteins, 
              oligonucleotides and related species as well as structurally  complex "small"
              organic molecules.  Specific applications of  five core users include (1) the
              study of ligand-  oligonucleotide interactions, (2) polypeptide structures 
              using conformationally contrained amino acid analogs, (3)  structual analysis
              of alkane thiols used to form self-  assembled monolayers, (4) structural
              analyses of organic  donor-acceptor molecules, (5) structural elucidation of 
              biologically active natural products.
