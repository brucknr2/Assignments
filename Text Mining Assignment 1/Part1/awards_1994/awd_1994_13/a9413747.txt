Abstract    :
              9413747  Arbabi, Freydoon    This is an instrumentation award.  The
              instrumentation in this  proposal will enable the civil and environmental
              engineering  faculty to further develop their research in civil engineering 
              materials.  Major research specialties will include cemented  aggregate
              mixtures (portland cement and asphaltic concrete),  incorporation of industrial
              residuals into cemented aggregate  mixtures, dynamic behavior of materials,
              wood engineering,  composite utilization, and adhesives.  ***
