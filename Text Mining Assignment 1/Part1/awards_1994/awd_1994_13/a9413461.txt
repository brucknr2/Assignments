Abstract    :
              HD/ Files/ Data/ Awards-FY94/ 9413461.roth.nr.sger  The objective of this
              project is to investigate and document  liquefaction-related deformations in
              the vicinity of the Los  Angeles Reservoir resulting from the January 17, 1994 
              Northridge, CA, earthquake.  (Observations in this area are  remarkably similar
              to those of the 1971 San Fernando  earthquake.)  Significant structural and
              soil-related damage  occurred, and a large amount of data was recorded at 
              numerous stations in the Los Angeles area,  Redondo Beach,  and the Port of Los
              Angeles.    This liquefaction-related data is expected to yield valuable 
              insight into the nature of liquefaction.  Specifically, it  will provide the
              opportunity to verify existing analysis  procedures for the prediction of the
              seismic performance of  earth structures.  ***
