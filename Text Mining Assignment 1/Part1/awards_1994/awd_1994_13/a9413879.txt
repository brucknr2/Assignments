Abstract    :
              9413879  Wendler  This project is an internationally collaborative (U.S.-French-
               Australian) study of katabatic winds along the coast of East  Antarctica,
              based on two lines of automatic weather stations, one  from the French station
              inland to Dome C, the other along the  coast.  The coastal array includes
              stations at Cape Denison and  Port Martin, which have recorded the highest
              average surface wind  speeds on the globe.  These winds drive the sea ice
              offshore, and  are responsible for extremely high heat fluxes from the ocean to
               the atmosphere.  Satellite-based active microwave imagery  (Synthetic Aperture
              Radar) will be combined with the observed  meteorological data to analyze the
              formation persistence and size  of offshore polynyas as a function of wind
              speed.  The coastal  array of weather stations will be augmented by three
              additional  instruments, and the University of Alaska receiving station for 
              Synthetic Aperture Radar data will be utilized to downlink images  of East
              Antarctica.  These images will be supplemented with images  from the Australian
              receiving station in Hobart, and, when it  becomes operational,  from the
              Radarsat receiving station at  McMurdo.  ***
