Abstract    :
              9413397  ODEN    This award will permit the University of Texas at Austin to
              build  a distributed company facility featuring a bank of high -  performance
              workstations, services and terminals connected by a  very fast fiber optic. 
              This facility will be for the Texas  Institute for Computational and Applied
              Mathematics (TICAM) and  will be an essential part of the environment for a new
               interdisciplinary graduate degree and research program.
