Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at Yale University acquire a 750 MHz NMR Spectrometer
              which will be used in  research.  The research activity to be supported
              includes:             Yale Core Research             (i)     NMR in Highly
              Polarized Samples, Polyhydrides and Catalysts           (ii)    Structure
              Determination in Media with Magnetic Field Induced Order           (iii)   NMR
              Studies of the Structured of RNA and Protein-RNA Complexes           (iv)   
              Determination of the Structures of RNA's and Ribonucleoproteins by NMR         
               (v)     NMR Studies of Quinone Orientation in Biological Membranes          
              (vi)    A Comparison of Amorphous Alumina and Mesoporous Molecular Sieves      
                    Research by Outside Users (Academic and Industrial)             (i)    
              Solids NMR Studies of Biological Systems Using a 750 MHz Spectrometer          
              (ii)    NMR Studies of DNA and Proteins           (iii)   Probing Structure in
              Low-Dimensional Conductors           (iv)    The Study of Acid and Basic
              Catalysts           (v)     Intermolecular Coherence Transfer           (vi)   
              Nucleophilic Substitution Mechanisms of Transition Metal Complexes in Zeolites

              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It
              is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from
               these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and
              in biology.
