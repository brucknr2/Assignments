Abstract    :
              Much economic research in the last decade has focused on the  phenomenon of
              knowledge spillovers, by which it is meant that the  externality that is
              created when one researcher's efforts  facilitate or enhance the success of
              someone else's efforts.   Knowledge spillovers are created in the public
              sector, when  universities and government labs produce basic research results 
              that provide the foundation for applied research in the private  sector; they
              are also created in the private sector when  researchers take advantage of
              knowledge produce by other private  agents.  These spillovers are key to
              understanding the process of  technological progress, how it contributes to
              economic growth,  and how policy levers can be used effectively to foster
              growth  through innovation.  The purpose of this research is to analyze  the
              flows of knowledge spillovers across time, technological  sectors, and
              geographic areas.  Relevant data is already being  assembled that will permit
              the testing of models of regional and  sectorial growth incorporating knowledge
              spillovers.  This  research is important because it will increase our
              understanding  of role of science and technology in fostering economic growth. 
               The results of this project will also be of interest to other  scholars and to
              science policy makers.
