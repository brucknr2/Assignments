Abstract    :
              9413022  Jordan  University of Iowa  Dr. Richard F. Jordan, Chemistry
              Department, University of Iowa, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
              and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for studies of
              the design, reactivity, and catalytic applications of electrophilic early
              transition metallocene complexes. Utilizing chiral, cationic complexes
              stereoselective olefin polymerization will be accomplished and a detailed
              investigation of the process will be undertaken. This phase of the study will
              also involve the development of catalytic, stereoselective C-H activation. To
              more fully delineate the interaction of these cations with unsaturated
              molecules, an olefin complex will be characterized and the chemistry will be
              extended to carbon monoxide. In order to modify the behavior of the
              metallocenes, carborane analogs of the cations will be prepared.     Olefin
              polymerization is one of the industrially most important processes and is used
              in the production of such polymers as polyethylene, polypropylene, and many
              others. The goal of this research is to design new catalysts which can
              efficiently induce the formation of well defined polymers which possess very
              regular arrangements of atoms.
