Abstract    :
                9413480  Likkel    The near-infrared spectra of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) will
              be studied in  order to characterize them in terms of electromagnetic emission 
              processes.  This research is especially timely because it involves  infrared
              wavelength observations which were not possible until  recently.  The initial
              observations of the project will be pursued by  using the infrared camera,
              GRIM-II, on the 3.5m telescope at Apache  Point Observatory in New Mexico.  The
              Washington State University  Program in Astronomy has access to this telescope
              and has the  facilities to reduce the data from the observations.    A major
              thrust of this project is to understand what effect emission  lines, etc, have
              on the infrared wavelength bands ,J, H, and K,  observed using photometric
              detectors.  What are the various  contributions to the brightness of the
              observed J, H, and K infrared  wavelength bands?   By answering this question,
              J, H, and K colors of  PNe can be interpreted more accurately.      Trends and
              correlations between the morphology, excitation,  composition, and other
              characteristics of the PNe, will be identified  so that the results can be
              generalized to other nebulae. The results of  the research will provide useful
              information that will benefit  astronomers studying PNe.  The results will also
              be useful to  researchers studying similar objects, such as symbiotic stars, BE
              type  stars, and ultra-compact ionized Hydrogen (HII) regions. Useful and 
              interesting results of the research will provide a basis on which a  more
              extensive project may be planned.
