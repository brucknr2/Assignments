Abstract    :
              9413090  Hoover       Polytechnic University has teamed with New York City
              Technical  College, New York City Industrial Technology Assistance 
              Corporation, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, KEPCO, Medical Laboratory  Automation,
              Loral Electronic Systems, IBM, Symbol Technologies,  Mini-Circuits, Avon
              Products, and Steinway & Sons to expand  Polytechnic University's innovative,
              practice-oriented M.S. Program  in Manufacturing Engineering.  The program
              concentrates on  improving the productivity of small manufacturers in the
              community.   The program relies heavily on adjunct faculty from local 
              manufacturing firms and its course projects require solving real  manufacturing
              problems.  Many of the students are member of  minorities employed at small
              firms.  The program's approach will  allow some students to complete a master's
              degree in manufacturing  education in one year.
