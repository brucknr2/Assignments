Abstract    :
                This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at Indiana University-South Bend acquire an
              electrochemical workstation which will  be used in research.  The research
              activity to be supported includes an investigation of the  electronic
              properties of a series of metal cluster compounds which contain   ligands, and 
              the investigation of the electron transfer and redox properties of arsenite
              oxidase.    An electrochemical workstation allows researchers to employ
              commonly used electrochemical  techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and anodic
              stripping voltammetry.  These techniques  study phenomena associated with
              electron transfer at the interface of an electrode and solution.
