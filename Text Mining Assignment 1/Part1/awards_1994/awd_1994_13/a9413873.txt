              volume for a  symposium to take place this summer in Columbus, Ohio entitled 
              "The Role of the  Cryosphere in Global Change".  The purpose of the meeting is
              to bring together  scientists involved with observing and modeling high
              latitude processes and  assessing the impact of changes in those processes on
              global climate.  This  symposium is being organized by the International
              Glaciological Society (IGS) and  is co-sponsored by the Byrd Polar Research
              Center, the American Meteorological  Society and the American Geophysical
              Union.  The symposium volume is to be  published as a proceedings volume of the
              Annals of Glaciology.  ***
