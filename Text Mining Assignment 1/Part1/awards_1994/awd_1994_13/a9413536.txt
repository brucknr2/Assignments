Abstract    :
              A high resolution X-ray photoemission spectrometer (XPS) will be  acquired with
              funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure  Program and will be employed
              in the characterization of advanced  materials such as ceramics, polymers,
              model catalyst systems and  composite materials. The XPS will have an energy
              resolution of  0.50eV at a counting rate of greater than 100 counts per second 
              and broad range survey counting levels will be in excess of 7  million counts
              per second. The facility will feature in-situ  sample preparation with sample
              heating, gas dosing for surface  reactivity experiments, and depth profiling
              through inert gas  sputter removal. The spectrometer will be used for: 
              characterization of polymer/ceramic and polymer/ polymer  interfaces; study of
              surface modifiers in heterogeneous catal-  ysis; understanding the processing
              mechanisms in photovoltaic  cell synthesis; identification of bonding
              configuations in ion  implantation surface modification; study of metal/ceramic
               interface properties; study of radioactive waste remediation;  studies of
              adhesion; and studies of the corrosive behavior of  ceramics.    The X-ray
              photoemission spectrometer will be employed for a wide  range of materials
              studies. These include the studies of a  variety if interfaces and surfaces.
              The investigations will  involve the chemical reactivity  and adhesion of
              surfaces, the  surface bonding modifications resulting from ion implantation, 
              the catalytic properties of modified surfaces, and the study of  the synthesis
              of photovoltaic cells.
