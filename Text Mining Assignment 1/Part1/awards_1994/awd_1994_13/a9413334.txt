Abstract    :
              The disposal of household garbage entails both resource and  environmental
              costs, but most residents in the United States  still pay no fee per bag for
              garbage collection.  A few  communities around the country now charge a price
              per bag, but  not enough is known to estimate household demand for the 
              collection and recycling of garbage as function of price,  household income,
              and demographic variable.  The purpose of this  project is to collect the
              necessary data to estimate  statistically the household demand for garbage
              collection and  recycling.  A new data set will be assembled from almost 200 
              cities covering a three year period.  This research will allow  municipal
              officials to more accurately predict the change in  demand for disposal
              services that would result from a change in  the price per bag charged for
              garbage collection.
