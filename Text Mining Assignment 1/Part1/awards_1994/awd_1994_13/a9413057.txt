Abstract    :
              9413057  Theoretical and computational research will be conducted on the 
              physics of fractional statistics.  The work builds on previous  research on
              anyon superconductivity and contributes to the physics  of the fractional
              quantum Hall effect.  Three specific projects are  proposed: (1) A quantum
              Monte Carlo study of the metal-insulator  transition for anyons; (2) The
              physics of a new quantum number  which is a measure of Hilbert space exclusion,
              that is, a  generalization of the Pauli Principle; (3) The application of a 
              dissipative mapping to the problem of stacking polytypes in metals  and
              insulators.  %%%  This theoretical research will focus on the study of
              particles with  fractional statistics, that is, particles unlike the common
              ones  found in the real world.  However, there is evidence that these 
              particles exist under special circumstances and may also underlay  other more
              common phenomena.  This research will study the  foundations of these particles
              and study a number of their possible  manifestations.  Additional effort will
              also be expended in  investigating various complex materials systems using a
              new  technique derived from nonlinear dynamics.
