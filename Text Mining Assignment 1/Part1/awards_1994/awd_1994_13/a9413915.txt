Abstract    :
              9413915  MacAdam    A Q-switched YAG laser, a pulsed titanium-sapphire laser and
              a  pulsed dye laser will be supplied to the research program in the  properties
              and collisions of highly cited (Rydberg) atoms at the  University of Kentucky. 
              This project will study collisions of  singly charged positive and negative
              ions with Rydberg atoms at  kinetic energies for which the projectile and
              electron speeds are  comparable.  This is the condition under which cross
              sections are  largest, theories have yet to be perfected, and new phenomena of 
              the quantum-mechanical three-body collision problem await  discovery.  Charge
              transfer, inelastic and ionizing collisions  will be measured at energies
              10-5000 eV.  The lasers are a  necessary foundation for preparing the
              state-selected targets in  this work.  Funding of the proposal would bring the
              pulsed laser  facilities in the Department of Physics and Astronomy up to a 
              high current standard and would allow the extension of research  into the
              unexplored collisional properties of coherent circular  and elliptical alkali
              Rydberg atoms.  With the same laser and  Rydberg crossed-beam apparatus,
              detailed studies will also be  undertaken of efficient state-to-state switching
              processes that  are mediated by the application of digitally generated and 
              profiled electric-field pulses.  ***
