Abstract    :
              A X-ray facility consisting of a rotating anode X-ray generator  and two
              different diffraction systems on opposite sides of the  generator will be
              acquired with the funds from the Academic  Research Infrastructure Program. One
              diffraction unit will be a  4-circle diffractometer for accurate lattice
              parameter and  structural determinations of thin films, single crystals, and 
              powder samples. A second diffraction unit will involve an  advanced
              2-dimensional array detector for small angle X-ray  scattering from biological
              and thin film samples. The facility  will be employed to study: 1) the
              structure of lanthanide  endohedral fulleneres and fullerene-encapsulated metal
               clusters, the study of low-dimensional mixed-valence compounds  associated
              with superconduct-ivity and and charge density  waves, 3) various properties of
              the unique van der Waals C60  solids, 4) magnetic multilayer thin films, 5)
              diamond thin  films prepared by chemical vapor deposition and ion- 
              implantation techniques, 6) growth of thin ferroelectric films  on crystalline
              and amorphous substrates, 7) genetic features of  regulatory proteins and the
              biochemistry and biology of  repressor proteins, 8) the thermodynamic
              properties of natural  minerals.    A modern X-ray facility with two types of
              diffractometers will  be employed to study a diverse range of materials by
              scientists  in the Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, Biosciences,  Materials
              Science and Geology Departments. The materials  studied will include
              fullerenes, diamond thin films, repressor  proteins, magnetic multilayers,
              ferroelectric thin films, and  natural minerals.
