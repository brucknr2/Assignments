Abstract    :
              9413948  Hollebeek    This award is to a consortium group from The University of
              Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, and the University of Illinois at
              Chicago.  The consortium is proposing to develop a scalable, wide area high
              performance meta-computer for problems which require numerically intensive
              analysis of large amounts of geographically distributed data. The experimental
              facilities will include a high-speed network linking existing parallel
              computers and high-performance clusters of workstations at the three
              institutions. In addition each institution in the consortium will acquire or
              upgrade a parallel machine. Software will be developed to implement the
              meta-computer concept whereby an individual using a node at any site will have
              access to all other nodes and distributed data as needed, regardless of the
              location of these entities.    The meta-computer design will be scalable in
              that additional distributed nodes can be added at any time. High speed access
              to the Internet will link the geographically-distant components, and
              technologies such as ATM will provide the local connections. Research and
              application areas to be addressed using these facilities include particle
              physics and condensed matter physics, imaging and virtual reality, and digital
              libraries.  ***
