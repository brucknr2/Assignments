Abstract    :
              9413492  Zollner    It is proposed to convert an existing single-wavelength 
              ellipsometer with a rotating analyzer to a spectroscopic  ellipsometer and to
              investigate the optical properties of  ternary silicon-germanium-carbon alloys
              which may have  optoelectronic applications.  Preliminary ellipsometric 
              measurements will be performed on other classes of emerging  materials, such as
              titanium-silicon-tin, which has possible  applications in the automotive
              industry as a thermocouple  material.  %%%  Same  ***
