Abstract    :
              9413808  Jensen   This award provides for the following research and teaching 
              equipment: a five-axis milling machine and tooling, a scientific  data and
              visualization computer system, surface measurement instruments (optical
              comparator, toolmaker's  microscope, etc.), piezoceramic actuators/sensors
              interfaced to an  adaptive controller, and cutting tools with internally
              mounted heat  and force sensors and associated telemetry systems.  This
              equipment  will be used in five research programs and in the Mechanical and 
              Manufacturing Engineering curriculums at Brigham Young University.  
              Interdisciplinary efforts using this equipment will continue their  focus on
              the elimination of machining errors and the subsequent  hand finishing of
              complex sculptured machined parts.              Coupled with the funding of 
              this request, more extensive research will study aspects of complex  machining
              of sculptured parts.  The impact to the nation's  manufacturing infrastructure
              could be a substantial decrease in the cost to manufacture molds and precision
              machined  parts for the automotive, aerospace and plastic industries.  This 
              research will help restore competitiveness to the American machine  tool, mold,
              and die industries which have seen a continued loss of  business to overseas
              competition during the past decade.
