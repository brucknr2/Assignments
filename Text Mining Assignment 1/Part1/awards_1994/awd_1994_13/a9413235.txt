Abstract    :
              9413235  Whitman    This award supports an integrated, multidisciplinary
              training program for  graduate and undergraduate students with a focus on
              microbial diversity.  The  research programs of the 22 participating faculty
              cover a wide range of  problems from identification and isolation of new
              organisms to analysis of  genetic and biochemical mechanisms at the molecular
              level.  The faculty group  come from the departments of biochemistry,
              entomology, marine science,  microbiology, and plant pathology.  Training
              arrangements include existing  courses, a new seminar program, a new yearly
              retreat, and a new summer workshop  that will focus in depth on two different
              organisms each summer.  The workshop  will involve students and faculty from
              across the nation, and is expected to  have a national impact on training of
              the next generation of microbial  researchers.      This award is also being
              supported by the Metabolic Biochemistry Program.    ***
