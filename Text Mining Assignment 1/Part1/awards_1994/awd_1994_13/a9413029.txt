Abstract    :
              9413029  Storm     The Gordon Research Conference on "Fibronectin,  Integrins,
              and Related Macromolecules" will be held in  February, 1995 in Oxnard,
              California.  As the paradigm of an  extracellular adhesin, fibronectin
              interactions with a  transmembrane receptor have proven applicable to a number
              of  cellular adhesion systems.  Many other extracellular  glycoproteins have
              been described with biological properties  similar to fibronectin, most of
              which have been sequenced  and some of which have known three dimensional
              structures.  These molecules are involved in a wide variety of basic  cellular
              functions in metazoans, of significance to such  areas of study as
              embryogenesis, tissue organization,  hemostasis, wound healing, immune
              functions, and  pathological states.  Proteins of this type have also been 
              discovered in higher plants, and their functions in plants  remains to be
              understood.  The challenges to the field over  the next several years are to
              comprehend and organize the  large amount of new structural information and
              design  experiments based on it, learn the relative biological  importance of
              the several seemingly redundant adhesion  systems in animal tissues, and apply
              the new insights to  practical ends.  The 1995 Gordon Research Conference will 
              serve as a valuable forum to present and discuss new  information, identify
              problem areas, and plan new  approaches. This grant provides partial support
              for expenses  of conferees with limited travel funds who would otherwise  not
              be able to attend, as well as applicants whose research  involves plants.  ***
