Abstract    :
              Near-infrared fluorescence is a relatively new technology which enables high
              sensitivity at reduced cost.  It is currently used in commercially available
              automated DNA Sequences as well as applied in single molecule detection
              research.  The large reduction in background fluorescence as well as the
              greatly reduced scatter effect.  Derived by operation in the near-infrared
              optical region accounts for the increased sensitivity.  The economical use of
              diode lasers and low noise silicon detectors has been made possible by recent
              technology advances in communications, optical storage, and video cameras.   
              This STTR project will investigate the feasibility of using near-infrared
              fluorescence for detecting and quantifying analytes using liquid chromatography
              (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (HPCE).  Various optical configurations
              will be fabricated in order to maximize sensitivity as well as compatibility
              with HPLC and HPCE.  Both direct fluorescence using analytes labeled with
              near-infrared dyes will be examined.  Applications includes detection of
              analytes in media such as blood where background fluorescence and scatter is
              greatly reduced in the near-infrared.
