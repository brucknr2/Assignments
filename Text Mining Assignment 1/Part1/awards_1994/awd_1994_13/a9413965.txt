Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to acquire a phosphorimaging system to be  shared by a group
              of scientists at the University of Texas,  particularly a group of five senior
              investigators. The common  research theme among these laboratories is
              structure-function  relationships of regulatory sequences, genes, and their 
              interacting or encoded proteins.
