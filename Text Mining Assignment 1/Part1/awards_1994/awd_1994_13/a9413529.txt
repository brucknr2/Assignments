Abstract    :
                This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at Miami University acquire a Laser Desorption
              Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer  which will be used in research.  The research
              activity to be supported consists of two general  parts:  the development of
              methods to extend the capabilities of the laser desorption time-of-  flight
              mass spectrometry and application of the technique to on-going research
              problems.   Projects related to technique development include an investigation
              of the mechanism of  matrix assistance and a study of the production of
              secondary ions.  The proposed  applications involve molecular biology,
              materials science, electrochemistry, and  bioanalytical chemistry.    Mass
              Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain  the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic
              and organometallic molecules.   It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
              tools available for the characterization of  compounds.  This mass spectrometer
              is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many  fields of
              chemistry.
