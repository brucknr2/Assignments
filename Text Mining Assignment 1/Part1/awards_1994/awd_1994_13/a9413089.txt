Abstract    :
              9413089  Sisson       Five universities--Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MIT,
              Cornell and two Historically  Black Colleges and Universities, North Carolina
              A&T, and Tuskegee--have come together in  an ambitious project to remake
              undergraduate engineering education.  The project is based on  a vision of the
              future engineering workplace in which virtual organizations are formed over 
              the National Information Infrastructure to create new products.  Each school
              will have a  "Design Studio of the Future" modeled on architectural teaching
              studios.  These design  studios will be electronically linked together. 
              Students will engage in product realization  projects that increase in
              complexity over four years.  For a senior project, students from all  five
              schools will form teams that "meet" over the Internet in real time to design
              and  prototype a new product.  The schools also will develop and use modular
              courseware for  manufacturing that can be used at other schools.
