Abstract    :
              This project is to understand the role of dynamic pressure in  controlling the
              size of the magnetosphere and disturbances in the  magnetosphere and its role
              relative to that of the geomagnetic  field.    Three specific topics will be
              persued.  First, the flux content and  shape of the geomagnetic tail.  Second,
              the relationship between  bursty flows, seen in the magnetotail and classified 
              by Vassilis  Angelopoulos, with ground based activity in the auroral oval.  
              Third, the quantification of geomagnetic activity as exemplified in  the
              substorm wedge.
