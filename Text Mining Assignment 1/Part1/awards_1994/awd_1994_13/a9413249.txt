Abstract    :
              OCE-9413249    This project will involve studies of the role of diatoms in new 
              production and in downward flux of biogenic silica, particulate  organic
              carbon, and nitrogen in oceanic areas of low biomass,  particularly the
              Southern and the subtropical Pacific Oceans.  The  role of diatoms in
              oligotrophic ocean systems is not well-  understood and may have been
              underestimated in the past.  The ocean  regions of study and comparison are
              both important in the overall  effort to improve understanding of ocean fluxes.
