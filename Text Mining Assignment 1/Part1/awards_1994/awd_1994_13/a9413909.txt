Abstract    :
              This is an Academic Research Infrastructure project to upgrade an  existing
              lidar system at Utah State University (USU).  It is a  collaborative effort
              that includes investigators from USU, the  University of Maryland, Clemson 
              University, the University of  Pittsburgh, and University College London.  The
              lidar system  provides measurements from which continuous profiles of
              atmospheric   temperatures, densities and winds can be derived.  The results
              will  be used to study the transport of energy and momentum from the  lower
              atmosphere to the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  The  continuous
              observations over a long period of time will shed light  on climatological
              questions relating to global change.  The upgrade  to the lidar system will
              increase the sensitivity of the instrument  by about a factor of thirty.  This
              is to be accomplished by  constructing a telescope with a collecting area of 5
              square meters.   The project includes the construction of a building to house
              the  lidar on the top of the Science and Engineering Building at USU.   After
              the upgrade the lidar system will be one of the most powerful  of its kind in
              the world.  The data will be made available to  atmospheric scientists and
              students.
