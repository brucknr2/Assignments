Abstract    :
              This acquisition will enable the university to upgrade and expand its research,
              practice, and  research training in formulation, modeling, and implementation
              of problems in industrial  mathematics.  This equipment enables the senior
              personnel on this project to continue  contributing to the advancement in the
              state-of-the-art tools used by industrial mathematicians.   The department will
              augment its course offerings by developing a new, one-year graduate course 
              teaching students through hands-on experience how to work with natural and
              social scientists,  engineers, managers, and business people to develop more
              complete and accurate models for  materials, manufacturing processes,
              marketing, distribution, and product performance.
