Abstract    :
              9413857  Saadatmanesh  This project will demonstrate experimentally and
              analytically the  feasibility of strengthening and retrofitting steel girders
              in  composite steel concrete bridges with epoxy bonded carbon fiber  laminates.
               For upgrading the flexural capacity, carbon fiber  plates or tapes are epoxy
              bonded to the girder tension flange.  For retrofitting, this material is epoxy
              bonded to the girder  tension flange which contains pre-existing fatigue
              cracks.  Three  beams will be tested under static loading to determine the 
              flexural strength of a composite section of concrete deck, steel  girder,
              carbon fiber tape, and epoxy.  This includes  strengthening in the positive and
              negative moment regions.  Five  sets of beam fatigue tests will be investigated
              for a section of  steel girder, carbon fiber tape, and epoxy.  This includes 
              investigation of:  Fatigue strength in the positive moment region  with
              pre-existing fatigue cracks; fatigue strength as a function  of applied stress
              range; classification of fatigue strength  according to the AASHTO's Standard
              Categories; and the ability of  retrofit to arrest fatigue crack growth.   
              This project is a joint effort between the University of Arizona  and the
              Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  All full-scale tests  will be conducted at
              the University of Arizona.  The coupon tests  will be performed at the
              Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  The  analysis of results and development of
              guidelines and methodology  for application of this technique will be performed
              by the  investigators at both institutions.  ***
