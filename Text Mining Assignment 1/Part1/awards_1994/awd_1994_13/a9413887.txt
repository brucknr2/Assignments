Abstract    :
              Support is sought to upgrade climatological/meteorological laboratory facilities
              in the Department of Geography at Michigan  State University (MSU).  The
              requested equipment will improve the student-to-computer ratio in the dedicated
              instructional  laboratory.  Computer-based exercises used in the introductory
              and survey courses will be made possible with the proposed  equipment. 
              Students will have access to all of the UNIX-based UNIDATA software packages
              and instructors will be able  to tap into community curriculum using the
              UNIDATA software.  These improved computer facilities will be available for 
              climatological research, particularly in the areas of graduate student and
              unfunded research.
