Abstract    :
              9413900  Dunbar       This award provides 62 per cent of the funding required 
              for the acquisition of an analytical  electron microscope to  be installed and
              operated in the Department of Geoscience at  the New Mexico Institute of Mining
              and Technology. The  institution is committed to providing the remaining funds 
              needed to acquire the instrument. The new electron  microscope laboratory will
              be managed as a campus-wide  facility open to all qualified staff and student
              users. The  system will be equipped with x-ray micro analytical  capabilities
              as well as with the usual imaging capabilities.  The need for both capabilities
              is present in many research  and teaching programs at the New Mexico Institute
              of Mining  and Technology, but the institution has never had such an 
              instrument available for research and teaching on campus  before. The research
              groups having the greatest need for  this instrument presently include those
              studying a) igneous  petrology and volcanology, b) structural geology, 
              metamorphic petrology and geochronology, c) global change,  d) sedimentology,
              e) environmental geochemistry, f) ore  genesis, g) crustal evolution, and h)
              metallurgy.  ***
