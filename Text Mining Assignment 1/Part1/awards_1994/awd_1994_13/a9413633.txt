Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Research project is
              designed to develop a universal Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
              controller/data station for step-scan and rapid-scan operation of any FT-IR
              spectrometer.  Research to determine the feasibility of this approach will
              apply control theory and mathematical analysis to servo design and signal
              processing  The theoretical  results will be tested with a prototype
              instrument.  The anticipated result is the technology to design, assemble and
              market a new generation of flexible FT-RI computers
