Abstract    :
              Support is sought acquire computer equipment to enable the Department of Earth
              and Atmospheric Sciences at Saint Louis  University (SLU) to expand the
              accessibility and number of products available from UNIDATA for both teaching
              and research.   The proposal requests a UNIX server and several UNIX
              workstations.  The additional equipment would expand student  access to
              UNIX-based workstations with X-windows capabilities.  Presently only one UNIX
              terminal is available and it is  five years old.  Moving to a UNIX environment
              would allow an expanded use of several very capable UNIX-based UNIDATA 
              software packages.  PC-based (OS/2)  software packages are used extensively at
              SLU for many teaching and research  applications.  However, the upgrade path
              for PC-based UNIDATA   software appears limited and the use of PC-based
              application packages will be phased out in favor of the UNIX platforms.   The
              requested equipment upgrade will provide us the opportunity to more fully
              integrate UNIDATA software into the SLU  curriculum and expand student
              experience with new technology and software.
