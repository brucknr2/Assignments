Abstract    :
                    9413995  Mason  This Academic Research Infrastructure (Instrumentation)
              program  award is made to provide partial support for the acquisition and 
              modification of Ultra-High-Speed Photographical Equipment that will  enhance
              existing facilities.  Research in the dynamic deformation  and fracture of
              materials, combustion of solids and manufacturing  lubrication will utilize
              this equipment.  It is anticipated that  the basic understanding developed may
              eventually lead to increased  rates of productivity in manufacturing problems.
