Abstract    :
                          9413040  Wake, D. B.  The Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University
              of California  at Berkeley, has operated the Hastings Natural History 
              Reservation since 1937.  Hastings is located in the Santa  Lucia Mountains, a
              coastal mountain range in central  California.  Over 900 ha of the natural
              community mosaic is  protected for research and teaching use.  Hastings
              supports  many ongoing research projects; in 1994 Hastings will  provide
              housing and facilities for about 40 field studies.  In 1989, funding from NSF
              provided a modern laboratory  space.  Recent private donations, support from
              NSF, from the  Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and the Berkeley campus has 
              allowed significant upgrading of Hastings' facilities.  Housing for 34
              researchers has been added or renovated since  1988.  A new domestic water
              storage, treatment and  distribution system has been installed.  Over the past
              six  years, use at Hastings has increased dramatically and  reached maximum
              seasonal use level determined by facility  capacity and an ongoing management
              plan.  Funding from the  UC-Natural Reserve System allowed purchase of hardware
              and  software for a geographic information system (GIS)  A GIS at  Hastings
              will be of great value to our resident and visiting  researchers, neighboring
              landowners, and the management  staff.    This project will provide for the
              acquisition of a global  positioning system (GPS) to incorporate existing data
              on  vertebrate populations and genetics into our GIS.  Other  administrative
              uses include location of the reserve  boundaries, updated maps of reserve
              buildings and utilities  and to conduct vegetation and habitat mapping.  A
              modern GIS  and GPS capability will continue to attract new researchers  and
              will expand the research and training opportunities for  current investigators.
