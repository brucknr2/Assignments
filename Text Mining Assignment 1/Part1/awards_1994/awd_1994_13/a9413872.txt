Abstract    :
              9413872  Shlomo  The atomic nucleus is a many-body system of strongly
              interacting  constituents bound together by the strongest forces known in 
              nature.  We will address unsolved problems in the study of  nuclei, considering
              the effects of short and long range  correlations on matter, energy and
              momentum density distributions  of the constituents of nuclei.  We will study
              important and  fascinating phenomena associated with the motions of single 
              nucleons, the correlated motions of several nucleons and the  collective
              motions of many nucleons.  Of particular interest are  the areas of excitation
              and decay of giant resonances, large  amplitude motion and dissipation and
              dynamic and decay of hot  nuclei.  For this purpose we will develop the
              formalism and the  numerical techniques for calculating the nuclear spectral 
              function, nuclear response function and the nuclear level  density.  ***
