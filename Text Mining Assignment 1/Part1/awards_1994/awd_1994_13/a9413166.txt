Abstract    :
              9413166  Morrison    This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean
              Circulation  Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP).  The
               PI will provide hydrographic support and scientific leadership for  the
              trans-Indian Ocean leg along 8 degrees South, designated as  WOCE section I-1. 
              Section I-1 is the northernmost of the zonal  sections to be carried out during
              the IO WHP, effectively crossing  the southern boundaries of both the Bay of
              Bengal in the east and  the Arabian Sea in the west.  From the data to be
              collected, the PI  and collaborators will compute separate heat, salt and
              water-mass  budgets for each of these basins.  Since the Arabian Sea is a major
               source of salt, and the Bay of Bengal is a major source of fresh  water to the
              world ocean, these measurements are crucial to  understanding the overall
              thermohaline circulation, especially in  conjunction with sections at
              comparable latitudes already completed  in the other oceans.  ***
