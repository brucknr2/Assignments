Abstract    :
              9413370  Kemper  This action will make possible the upgrade of the Florida State
               University Tandem charging system by replacing the canvas  charging belt with
              a commercial pelletron charging system.  The  charging system is the last
              component of the tandem to be  upgraded.  The original acceleration tubes,
              stripper foil  assembly and column resistors in the tandem have been previously
               upgraded or replaced.  This charging system has been installed in  seven FN
              tandems to date and has been shown to greatly increase  their reliability.  The
              upgrade is also expected to allow an  increase in normal operational terminal
              voltage from 8.75 MV to  10 MV, and a reduction in the terminal ripple from
              typically 3-5V  to 1kV peak-to-peak.  Other components of the beam handling 
              system will also be upgraded.  ***
