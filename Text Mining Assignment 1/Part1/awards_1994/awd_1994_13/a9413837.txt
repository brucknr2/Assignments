Abstract    :
              9413837  Hart       This award provides partial funding for the  modernization
              of a 1975, "home-built", thermal ionization  mass spectrometer in the
              Department of Geology and  Geophysics at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution. The  Institution is committed to providing the remaining funds 
              necessary for this instrument upgrade project. The  instrumental upgrade
              includes a refit of the vacuum system,  power supplies, magnet control system,
              ion detection system,  and a new oxygen leak valve. The spectrometer system is
              used  by the Principal Investigator and colleagues at the Woods  Hole
              Oceanographic Institution in numerous research projects  requiring accurate
              isotopic analyses for applications in  measuring the temporal variation of
              osmium isotopes in sea  water, investigation of the osmium-rhenium isotope 
              systematics in organic-rich marine sediments, use of osmium  isotopes as
              tracers of anthropogenic metals in the marine  environment, and basic research
              for a better general  understanding of the factors affecting the geochemical 
              behavior of osmium in the environment.  ***
