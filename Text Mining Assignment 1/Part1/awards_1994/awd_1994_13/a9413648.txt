Abstract    :
              proposal# 9413648  PI - Sobczynski    This Small Business Technology Transfer
              (STTR) Phase I research project will investigate a new near-infrared
              spectrophotometer which has no moving parts.  The instrument is based on an
              array of solid state light emitting devices and can work with or without a
              diffraction grating depending on application.  The array of light emitting
              diodes (LED) cover a specific, application dependent spectral range in infrared
              wavelengths of 1um to 3.5 um.  The LEDs will be designed, then some selected
              wafers will be epitaxially grown and processed and the feasibility studies of
              the diode and array manufacturing would be explored.
