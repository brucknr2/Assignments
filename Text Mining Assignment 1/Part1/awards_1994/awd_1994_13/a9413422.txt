Abstract    :
              9413422  Mertzman       This award provides partial funding for the acquisition 
              and installation of a scanning electron microscope equipped  with an energy
              dispersive x-ray microanalysis system. The  instrument will be installed and
              operated at Franklin &  Marshall College. F & M College is committed to
              providing  the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition.  Scholarship and
              research are pursued in parallel at F & M as  forms of undergraduate teaching.
              Science education at the  college level works best in an atmosphere saturated
              with  opportunities for undergraduate research. The new instrument  will be
              used primarily in applications involving several  scientific disciplines and
              for a range of activities  including undergraduate course work, independent
              student  research projects, and faculty-student research projects.  ***
