Abstract    :
              9413088  Gordon       New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) will change its 
              engineering curriculum to provide each engineering undergraduate  with an
              understanding of manufacturing processes.  A year-long  course on product
              design and manufacturing will be developed using  a simulated factory floor
              facility.  An elective senior year design  course will be offered to give
              students experience in design for  manufacturing under the supervision of
              faculty and industrial  experts.  In addition, manufacturing principles will be
              introduced  into management and liberal arts courses offered to all NJIT 
              students.  Resources available to NJIT include the National Science 
              Foundation-sponsored Gateway Coalition and a feeder network of 19  community
              colleges.  Industry involvement in this effort will  include hosting student
              interns during the summer and a seminar  series by industrial experts.***
