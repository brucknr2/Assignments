Abstract    :
                            9413209  Lipscultz, F.  Improvements in the field-work
              infrastructure of the Bermuda  Biological Station for Research, Inc (BBSR) will
              be achieved  through the construction of a new facility.  BBSR has  sponsored
              marine research from the special perspective of a  mid-Atlantic Island since
              1903.  The institution has grown  dramatically in the past decade, during which
              it has have  maintained its commitment to visiting scientists in both  marine
              biology and oceanography.  BBSR has expanded that  commitment by creating a new
              molecular biology facility.  This growth has led to overcrowding and
              inefficiencies in  support of all types of field activities.  This project will
               support the upgrade some of the basic station infrastructure  that directly
              supports the entire suite of marine  activities.  BBSR will build a new 30' by
              95' scientific  support and maintenance building dedicated to the storage of 
              scientific equipment behind the present workshop and  oceanographic storage
              facility (Pew Building).
