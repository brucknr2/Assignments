Abstract    :
              Kassner  9413131       The research is to develop an efficient spheroidization 
              technology for several aluminum alloys.  Specific heating processes  and
              cycles, compositions, and forming operations will be developed  that allow
              effective production and fabrication of spheroidized  semi-solids as determined
              by cost and final material properties.  Traditional metal shaping processes
              such as casting and forging can  be dramatically improved in terms of cost and
              reliability using  novel semi-solids alloys.  However, this is possible only
              with  special processing of semi-solids to ensure a spheroidized 
              microstructure.  Semi-solids with a typical dendritic morphology of  the solid
              phase cannot be readily shaped due to cracking.  To date,  producing a
              spheroidized microstructure on a commercial scale has  been difficult.        
              The research is directed at the use of semi-solids in the  casting of aluminum
              alloys.  The reduction of casting temperatures  in foundries is a worthy goal. 
              The manufacturing process  development is a collaborative effort between an
              aluminum industry  and the university.  The commerical potential of the work is
              high.
