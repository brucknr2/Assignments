Abstract    :
              9413175  Bray  In this project, the PI will lead the data collection effort on a
               hydrographic section between Indonesia and Australia, designated as  line I-10
              of the Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE) of the World Ocean  Circulation Experiment
              (WOCE).  Conductivity, temperature, oxygen,  nutrients, Chlorofluorocarbons,
              and Helium/Tritium will be sampled.   In addition, Acoustic Doppler Current
              Profiles will be obtained,  and 10 ALACE (Autonomous LAgrangian Current
              Explorer) floats will  be deployed.  Line I-10 is crucial to understanding the
              amount of  flow entering the Indian Ocean from the Pacific Ocean, and its 
              measurement on this section, as well as on other sections by other  countries
              will provide a key to interpreting all the other  measurements made in the IOE.
