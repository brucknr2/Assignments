Abstract    :
              9413023  Smith    Description:  This project supports the  participation of a
              Pakistani scientist, Dr. M.  Saleh Ajaz, from the H.E.J Research Institute  of
              Chemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan,  in a collaborative project with
              Dr. David L.  Smith of the Medicinal Chemistry and  Pharmacognosy Department at
              Purdue University.   The project is intended to isolate and  determine the
              structures of certain proteins  and natural products.  Specifically, two 
              important classes of proteins will be examined:  casein isolated from camel
              milk, and  hemoglobins from several species of birds.  It  is intended to
              locate sites of phosphorylation  in the casein and to compare the three- 
              dimensional structural features and dynamics of  casein and hemoglobin from
              different species.   The utility of new mass spectrometric  ionization methods
              (electrospray and laser  desorption) for determining the molecular  weights of
              biologically active natural products  that cannot be analyzed by conventional
              mass  spectrometric methods will also be  investigated.    Scope:  This project
              seeks to accomplish two  objectives:  the analysis of specific proteins  using
              modern and innovative techniques; and  familiarizing the Pakistani scientist
              with the  modern techniques used in the U.S. to enable  him to maintain a
              parallel research activity at  the H.E.J. Institute in Pakistan, for joint 
              work with the laboratory of Dr. Smith.  The  long- term parallel activities
              will be  beneficial to both sides because of the access  in Pakistan to
              different species, and their  ability to do first-rate analytical chemistry 
              research.  The development of this long-term  linkage meets the objectives of
              the Division of  International Programs.  ***
