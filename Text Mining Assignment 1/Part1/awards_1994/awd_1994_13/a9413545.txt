Abstract    :
                This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at the University of Missouri-Columbia acquire an
              Automated Neutron Irradiation  Nuclear Spectroscopy System which will be used
              in research.  The research activity to be  supported includes  research and
              research training utilizing: (1) instrumental neutron  activation analysis
              (INAA), including variations such as epithermal INAA  (EINAA), cyclic  INAA
              (CINAA) and cyclic epithermal INAA (CEINAA), (2) radiochemical neutron 
              activation analysis (RNAA), and (3) radioisotope production.    Neutron
              Irradiation/Nuclear Spectroscopy systems allows scientists to determine the
              energies of  neutrons and their relative intensities by observing the gamma
              rays released in nuclear reactions.   Activation Analysis bombards a specimen
              with neutrons, where identification is made by  measuring the resulting ratio
              isotope.
