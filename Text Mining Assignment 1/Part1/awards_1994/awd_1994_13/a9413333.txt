Abstract    :
              9413333  Stone-Martin  Support for an NSF Backbone Transition Planning Workshop
              FARNET  (The Federation of American Research Networks) has requested  partial
              support for a planning workshop aimed at developing goals  for the transition
              and a model of the critical planning steps  needed.  It will also serve as a
              forum for team building.  The  workshop will bring together networking
              stakeholders from all  sectors to discuss issues related to the transition and
              the next  phase of the NSF backbone evolution.  This planning process is very 
              timely with regard to the overall interest in both the  Administration and
              Congress for the overall vision of the  Networking Information Infrastructure
              and the part that the current  Internet will play in it.    Funds will be used
              to partially defray travel costs of the academic  attendees and to pay for post
              forum editing and costs for  disseminating the resulting report.
