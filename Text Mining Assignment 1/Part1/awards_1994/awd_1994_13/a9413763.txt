Abstract    :
              A state-of-the-art advanced materials synthesis and processing  facility
              focusing on the growth and fabrication of ceramic-  based thin film materials
              will be funded with the assistance of  the Academic Research Infrastructure
              Program. The facility will  include a multi-technique thin film materials
              synthesis chamber  equipped with a microwave plasma source, effusion cells, 
              electron beam evaporators, magnetron sputter sources, and a  Kauffman ion
              source. Characterization capabilities will include  in-situ reflection high
              energy electron diffraction (RHEED),  mass spectrometry for controlling growth
              processes, X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and a novel Hall probe for
              in-  situ film characterization. Three major areas of research will  be
              impacted significantly by the facility, namely 1) solid  state micro-sensors,
              2) nanomechanics of materials, and 3)  surfaces and interfaces in
              hetero-epitaxial oxide systems. In  the sensor work, which has connections with
              local industry, the  synthesis and processing of well-defined doped metal-oxide
               films will be developed with the goal of understanding and  controlling the
              molecular scale mechanisms by which surface  microstructure, dopant type, and
              operating temperature  influence sensor performance.    A broad based advanced
              materials synthesis and processing  facility for the growth and fabrication of
              ceramic-based thin  films will be operated for the study of solid state 
              microsensors based on metal-oxide ceramic films. The  nanomechanics of these
              ceramic thin films will be studied, as  well as the surfaces and interfaces
              occurring in  heteroepitaxial oxide systems.
