Abstract    :
              9413375   Thomas   This award provides funds for the purchase of a
              state-of-the-art InSb focal-plane-array (FPA), high frame-rate infrared (IR)
              imaging system.  The FPA will consist of a 512 by 512 matrix of detectors with
              associated electronic hardware and software, which will be capable of reading
              out an image at a pixel rate of 18 megapixels/second.  The imager will be able
              to zoom in on selected areas of the image, while maintaining the same pixel
              rate.  It will also operate in the "snapshot" mode, in which all pixels of the
              array will integrate at the same time, making it possible to produce thermal
              images on a microsecond time scale, with no time delay for different areas of
              the image.   This equipment will enable research on delamination of ceramic
              coatings on pistons, impact damage on fiber-reinforced polymer and ceramic
              composites, corrosion and disbonds in aging aircraft, defects in metal castings
              and metal powder parts, wall thinning in nuclear reactor pipes, cracks in
              railroad rails, and many other applications.
