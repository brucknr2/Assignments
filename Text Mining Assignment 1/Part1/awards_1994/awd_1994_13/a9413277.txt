Abstract    :
              9413277  Ho  This project is for the collection of perishable data following 
              the Northridge, CA, earthquake of January 17, 1994.  It concerns  the
              performance of permanently reinforced earth structures (PRES)  and temporarily
              reinforced earth structures (TRES) under  conditions of strong ground shaking. 
              A significant number of  seismically-induced slope failures occurred over a
              large area  around the earthquake epicenter; however, permanently reinforced 
              earth structures and temporarily reinforced earth structures  suffered no
              damage, even though significant damage occurred to  structures in close
              proximity.    The objective of this project is to collect perishable data 
              concerning the performance of permanently reinforced earth  retaining walls and
              natural and engineered slopes, in order to  incorporate this knowledge into
              future earthquake hazard  mitigation procedures.  ***
