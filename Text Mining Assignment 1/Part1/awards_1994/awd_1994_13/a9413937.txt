Abstract    :
              9413937  Ernst  The equipment furnished here will substantially upgrade the 
              research-related computing capabilities in the Physics Department  of
              Vanderbilt University while providing additional resources for  teaching that
              are related to research.  Faculty members in the  fields of atomic, nuclear and
              high energy physics will implement  a workstation farm that would be operated
              by Vanderbilt's  computing center.  Each research group relies heavily on 
              computing power to be competitive in its field.  In addition,  both
              undergraduate and graduate students will be served by this  facility which will
              be used for specialized courses that involve  the use of the most up-to-date
              computers.  ***
