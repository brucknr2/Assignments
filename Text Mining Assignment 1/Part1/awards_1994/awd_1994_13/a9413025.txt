Abstract    :
              9413025  Pritchard    Taste is a critical sense for animal survival, determining
               what is good and what is not good to eat.  Yet compared with  our
              understanding of other sensory modalities like sight and  hearing , we have
              only a rudimentary knowledge of the  gustatory system.  Sight, hearing and
              touch are centrally  organized in a hierarchical fashion in the mammalian
              brain;  in particular, the thalamus is a major brain region above  the
              brainstem which processes and integrates sensory  information before it gets to
              the level of the cortex.  We  have little comparable information on central
              processing in  taste pathways.  This project uses novel experiments with 
              sophisticated behavioral tests to see what particular  processing occurs in the
              brainstem, without the  contributions from the thalamus.  The unique approach
              will  determine whether specific taste deficits represent a  sensory loss, a
              change in behavioral motivation, or a  perceptual deficit, each of which could
              influence taste-  guided behavior.  These results will provide needed 
              fundamental advances in our understanding of taste; results  will be important
              beyond chemosensory neuroscience, to  cognitive and perceptual issues of brain
              function, and to  the food industry.
