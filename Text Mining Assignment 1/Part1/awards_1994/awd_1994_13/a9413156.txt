Abstract    :
              9413156  Warren  This project is a contribution to the Indian Ocean Expedition
              (IOE)  of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  In it, the PI  will
              participate as a co-principal investigator on two separate  legs of the
              hydrographic survey:  line I-2 along 8 degrees South,  and I-3 along 20 degrees
              South.  In addition, the PI will  collaborate in the analysis and synthesis of
              the data on these and  other sections collected as part of the IOE, as well as
              with the  data from current meters deployed along line I-3.  Objectives 
              include studies of meridional overturning, and descriptions of  detailed paths
              and transports of deep currents in the tropical  South Indian Ocean that
              contribute to this overturning.  ***
