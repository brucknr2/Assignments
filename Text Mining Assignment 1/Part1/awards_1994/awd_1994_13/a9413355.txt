Abstract    :
              Many countries are currently instituting sweeping changes in  economic policy in
              areas such as liberalization of trade and  capital flows, monetary and fiscal
              policy, greater reliance on  markets, and privatization.  Countries which have
              a history of  highly variable economic policies have experienced booms in 
              economic activity, consumption, and imports following sharp  policy changes. 
              The purpose of this project is to analyze the  effects of uncertainty about the
              timing and nature of shifts in  economic policy on the dynamics of consumption,
              investment, asset  accumulation, and capital flows: and to determine how
              variability  of policy may influence these dynamics.  A general analytical 
              framework will be developed to study the effects of uncertainty  created by
              economic policy changes.
