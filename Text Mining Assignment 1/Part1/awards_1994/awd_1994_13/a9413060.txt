Abstract    :
              9413060  Petkovsek  Harford Community College requests support from NSF for 
              connection to SURAnet for their campus and the Higher Education  and Applied
              Technology Center (HEAT) campus which it shares with  Cecil County Community
              College.  The HEAT is the only institution  in the two county area that offers
              a four year degree.     SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the
              southeastern  United States.  It will provide operations management and 
              information services and it will give Eckerd College a 56  thousand bits per
              second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed  (1.5 - 45 million bits per
              second) National Backbone network.    The colleges has experienced a growth in
              auxiliary programs that  has added value to the basic mission that the college
              serves to  aid the education of all persons of all ages.  The networking  plan
              at Harford Community College and the Higher Education and  Applied Technology
              Center is the foundation for uniting all the  disciplines and campus groups.
