Abstract    :
              The  goal  of  this  project  is to develop  a  sound  basis  and  methodology 
              for  the  representation of corpora  and  linguistic  information  in  corpora,
               as well as for  the  design  of  text-  handling   tools,  for  use  in 
              corpus-based  natural   language  processing   (NLP)   research.  The   work  
              is   undertaken   in  collaboration with the Laboratoire Parole et Langage  in 
              Aix-en-  Provence, France. The project involves (1) analysis of the  needs  of 
              corpus-based  NLP research, both in terms of  the  kinds  and  degree  of
              annotation required and the requirements for efficient  processing,  
              accessibility,  etc.;  (2)  analysis   of   general  properties and
              configuration of corpora, analysis of the relevant  structural and logical
              features of component text types, and  the  design  of  encoding mechanisms
              that can represent  all  required  elements   and   features  while 
              accomodating  the  requirements  determined  in  (1);  and (3) specifications 
              for  text  software  design,  coordinated with (2), designed to avoid 
              redundancy  and  maximize  the  modifiability, extendability, and  reusability 
              of  corpus-handling software. The methods and materials developed  in  this 
              project  will  provide a comprehensive  framework  for  the  machine 
              representation and manipulation  of  large  corpora  for  corpus-based NLP
              research, thus enabling both software  and  data  to be easily shared, used,
              and re-used in the future.
