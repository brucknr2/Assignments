Abstract    :
              The projects discussed in this proposal represent  interdisciplinary work in the
              Department of Chemistry and  other Departments at Iowa State University dealing
              with a  common theme: the importance of protein structure and  dynamics for
              protein function.    The problem discussed in this proposal range from the 
              assembly and folding of proteins, the structural role of  proteins in
              determining efficient energy transfer among  naturally occurring photosynthetic
              pigments, and the way in  which proteins interact with surfaces.    In order to
              address these representative problems, dedicated  equipment is required. 
              Because proteins are the central  theme of proposal, instruments to synthesize
              and to purify  long-chain peptides on a large scale and to characterize  their
              structural integrity are requested.  The carefully  designed proteins will be
              subjected to studies described in  the text that characterize their
              interactions with surfaces  either by Fourier transform infrared and Raman
              techniques or  that monitor their reactivity on time scales from hundreds  of
              femotseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds by various time-  resolved techniques.
