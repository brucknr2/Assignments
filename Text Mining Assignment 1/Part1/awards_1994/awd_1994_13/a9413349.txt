Abstract    :
              9413349  Pohm   The SBIR Phase II project proposes several intermediate and long
              range research objectives to extend promising Phase I results obtained on
              multiple, giant magnetoresistance (GMR) read head sensors to the point where
              they can be applied commercially.  These objectives are to explore low
              temperature glasses and other materials to form a smooth surface at the top of
              the first half gap material deposited over the lower shield, in order to
              optimize the GMR material.  The use of cobalt-plantinum or other high
              coercivity materials at the edges of the sensors is to be explored for domain
              stabilization.  In addition, both sensor structures with one magnetic layer
              pinned by exchange and structures without pinning are to be examined and
              compared.  Read heads made with these GMR sensors are to be fabricated and
              evaluated on disks for signal output and noise.  Modeling will also be extended
              to the combined longitudinal, end-on structures.  Multiple folded head sensors
              are to be explored for use in longer range, extremely high density (1-5 billion
              bits/sq. in.), high performance (100 to 200 MHz), applications along with the
              required, optimized, integrated, SOS-CMOS or BiCMOS circuitry and connection
              channel.  A commercialization plan was developed which includes a follow-on
              commitment by the world's largest thin film head producer.
