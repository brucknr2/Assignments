Abstract    :
              A novel system, based on two video cameras, is developed to  quantify the
              position of a moving subject. Human operators  will track the subject with
              cameras that rotate.  The  innovative feature of the system is its ability to
              record  the pan and tilt directions  of each camera as the cameras  are moved.
              The direction angles are measured by  optical  shaft encoders and stored on the
              image at video frame rates  in bar code   format. These angles and the pixel
              coordinates  of the subject in the video images  will be used to  calculate the
              position of the subject in three-dimensional  space. The data gathered will
              establish the feasibility of  building a portable video camera system to study
              animal  locomotion out of doors.
