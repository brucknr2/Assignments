              Title; Aircraft Radiation Observations During TOGA COARE    Radiation data
              collected during TOGA COARE by NOAA-P3 Turboprops  will be processed, analyzed
              and synthesized.  I will be inter  compared with NCAR Electra and NASA DC-8
              radiation measurements.   Boundary layer cloud information and SST will be
              obtained from PRT-  5 data.  The aircraft data will be combined with the
              synoptic scale  analysis using ECMWF and NOGAPS models to define large scale 
              conditions.   Using BETTS-RIDGWAY scheme, radiative transfer  budgets will be
              calculated over the TOGA COARE area.  These results  will be compared with the
              results obtained for CEPEX area to  understand similarities and differences
              between the boundary layers  under similar large scale atmospheric radiation
              conditions but with  different SSTs.
