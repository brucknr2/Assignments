Abstract    :
                                  9413199  Burris, J.  The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL)
              will purchase  laboratory and multi-user equipment that will benefit  resident
              and visiting scientists and the educational  program.  The acquired equipment
              will support ongoing  efforts in environmental, cell, and organismal biology, 
              increasing capabilities in sample analysis and preparation  for a variety of
              studies.  The acquisition addresses the  capability to precisely and accurately
              measure the nitrogen  and carbon contents and to determine the carbon quality
              of  plant tissue, litter, soil and sediment samples that are  central to the
              research of the MBL's Ecosystems Center and  to visiting collaborators from
              other institutions.  In order  to achieve this capability MBL will obtain a
              near infrared  reflectance (NIR) analysis system for rapid, non-destructive 
              measurements of samples.  The NIR system would consist of an  NIR analyzer, a
              dedicated personal computer to run NIR  software, and a large capacity grinding
              mill for preparing  samples.  The second acquisition addresses the ability to 
              prepare biological samples and preparations in order to  apply modern molecular
              biology methods to their study.  Small quantity, high-quality, centrifuges are
              essential to  this preparation, and MBL will acquire a Micro-  Ultracentrifuge
              that will provide this capability for  visiting researchers and appropriate
              educational users.
