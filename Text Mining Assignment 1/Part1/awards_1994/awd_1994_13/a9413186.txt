Abstract    :
              9413186  Chua    The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project 
              between Dr. Leon Chua of the University of California, Berkeley,  and Dr. Tamas
              Roska of the Hungarian Computer and Automation  Institute, Budapest, is to
              determine the basic quantitative  properties of a cellular neural network
              analog processor they  have been working on together.  Specifically, they will
              examine:  1) the class of operations realizable with analogic cellular  neural
              network instructions; 2) the properties and conditions for  spatially
              propagating and non-propagating modes of operation; 3)  the classes of partial
              differential equations representable; and  4) global and local processing
              mechanisms for their cellular  neural network analog array computer.  Results
              are expected to  contribute to our basic knowledge of analogic nonlinear
              computing  structures.    This project in computer information processing
              research fulfills  the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by 
              enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to  combine
              complementary talents and share research resources in  areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.    ***
