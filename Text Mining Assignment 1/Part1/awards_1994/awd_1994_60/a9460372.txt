Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to use
              overlapped Cartesian grid and Body-Fitted (BF) prism grids for solving viscous
              flow problems. Given a geometry definition in the form of triangularized
              surfaces, a BF prism mesh will be generated using the advancing layers
              technology with grid clustering near body surfaces. This prism mesh is then
              overlapped with a coarse uniform Cartesian background grid. Initially the
              Cartesian grid will be refined to have similar resolution near the prism grid.
              A high-order flow solver based on linear reconstruction and Roe's
              flux-difference splitting will be developed. Grid adaptation according to the
              physical nature of the flow field will be carried out to place control volumes
              where required the most, achieving maximum accuracy with minimum resources. An
              explicit multi-grid procedure will be employed to speed up the simulation
              process. The interface between the Cartesian and prism grid will be treated by
              conserving mass, momentum and energy flux on the outer boundary of the prism
              grid. The overall algorithm integrates grid generation and flow solver into one
              complete system to obtain maximum solution accuracy, efficiency and user
              friendliness. In Phase I, the above methodology will be implemented and
              demonstrated for 2-D viscous flow problems. Extension to 3-D and moving body
              problems and implementation in a commercial code will be made in Phase II.
