Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims at developing novel
              adaptive signal processing techniques to be used in the design of hands-free
              telecommunication systems. Many of the telecommunication systems like car
              phones, desktop teleconferencing systems, videoconferencing applications depend
              heavily on the use of hands-free technology, that is, the ability to
              communicate without having to continuously hold a device. However, the
              elimination of the handset introduces some technical difficulties. The acoustic
              environment in which the hands-free system is placed is in general, much more
              complex than the line environment that the present technology is capable of
              handling. Two of the most important artifacts that accompany hands-free systems
              are acoustic echoes (which are more complicated than the line echoes, due to
              the complexity of the environment) and noise (which is a common problem in
              almost all kinds of communication systems, but is even more pronounced for
              hands-free systems). The techniques that will be developed in Phase I aim at
              solving the acoustic echo cancellation problem. The adaptive techniques
              developed are also expected to be applicable, with appropriate modifications,
              to noise cancellation. The main objective of the Phase I effort is to determine
              the feasibility of using the wavelet transform in adaptive echo cancellation.
              Better performance and a reduction in the complexity of the overall system is
              expected, together with a reduced cost.
