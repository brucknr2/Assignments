Abstract    :
              9460720   Lin    This SBIR Phase I project explores a holographic optical
              associative memory (HOAM) technology for asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
              communication network applications.  With the recent intensive development
              efforts in high speed optical transceivers and optical switching arrays, the
              bottleneck of future fiber optic ATM networks will be in the data processing of
              header information of incoming ATM cells (rather than in the transceiver and
              switch array).  In other words, an ultrafast processor is needed to determine
              the routing decision and provide the decision to the switching array for
              physical switching operations.  It is found that the processing time of the
              processor should be much shorter than the data packet duration of an ATM cell. 
              In such a way, the processor enable an ATM switch node to handle incoming ATM
              cells on-the-fly, and requires a very small buffer memory in the node.  A small
              network testbed with a preliminary HOAM based switch node will be constructed
              in Phase I to examine the feasibility of the proposed technology.  Packaging
              issues will also be evaluated because the ultimate goal is a compact HOAM
              processor chip that can be mounted on a circuit board.
