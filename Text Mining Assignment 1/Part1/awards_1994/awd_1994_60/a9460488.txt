Abstract    :
              Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) proposes to develop a clean-starting, high
              turndown advanced technology catalytic combustor as the combustor for small gas
              turbine engines for use in hybrid range-extended electric automotive vehicles.
              The low NOx (e.g., l-2ppm) offered by an efficient lean burn catalytic
              combustor together with the ability of clean starting (minimizing hydrocarbon
              and carbon monoxide omissions) would make a range-extended (and hence
              commercially attractive) electric vehicle with low enough emissions to satisfy
              air quality needs. In this Phase I, PCI will seek to experimentally establish
              the viability of its concepts for clean cold starting in an advanced catalytic
              combustor. The emissions goal is to achieve better than California ULEV
              standards, and to explore the potential for achieving emissions, especially of
              NOx, in the same range as electric utilities with state-of-the-art
              aftertreatment.  Such an engine could legitimately be considered a `Zero
              Emission Vehicle` engine.
