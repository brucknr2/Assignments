Abstract    :
              New in situ soil treatments are needed to remediate soil contaminated with toxic
              metals. Electrokinetics is an in situ soil remediation technique that involves
              the transport of contaminants by applying an electric field between electrodes
              inserted in soil. The method involves no excavation or off-site transportation
              of contaminated material, and, should be very acceptable to the public in
              adjacent communities as a remediation method. However, there are considerable
              technical problems to be overcome before this technique can be considered as an
              effective means of soil decontamination. The first problem is that during
              electrokinetic processing the soil pH around the negative electrode (i.e.,
              cathode) rises causing the transport of contaminants to drop and the energy
              required to drive the process to increase. A second problem is how to achieve
              efficient contaminant migration through the soil. This proposal describes
              research to demonstrate the feasibility of two electrochemical innovations that
              when applied together will eliminate important technical barriers preventing
              the efficient use of electrokinetic processing for soil remediation. These
              innovations will prevent high pH at the cathode and will provide a
              fundamentally new mechanism for achieving rapid contaminant migration in soil.
              Phase I experiments will be carried out using bench scale systems with natural
              soils contaminated with heavy metals.
