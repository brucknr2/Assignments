Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase I project will investigate a new phenomenon discovered recently
              at Ultramet while fabricating thermionic emission devices using thin films of
              lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6), a low work function thermionic emitter. This
              phenomenon, designated giant impedance transition (GIT), is represented by a
              large and very fast change in impedance (or resistance in DC) in response to
              external electromagnetic and electrostatic radiation. It should be noted that
              all observations of the GIT phenomenon have been extremely preliminary,
              obtained merely as a byproduct of the thermionic emission work being performed,
              with no focus having been given to the phenomenon itself. As such, much
              additional work is required to understand the physics of the GIT phenomenon and
              quantify it before proceeding to the device design stage. In this program,
              Ultramet will investigate the GIT phenomenon to achieve an understanding of its
              physics, perform quantitative analysis, and relate the behavior of the
              impedance change in the LaB6 deposit to its microstructure and thus, the
              processing technique. Ultramet will team with the Electrical Engineering
              Department of the University of Utah for characterization of the electrical and
              optical properties of LaB6 thin films produced at Ultramet. The successful
              completion of this effort will result in an understanding and quantification of
              the GIT phenomenon, as well as a direction for device design and fabrication to
              be pursued in follow-on work.
