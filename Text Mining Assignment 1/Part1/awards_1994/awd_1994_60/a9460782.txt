Abstract    :
              Physical Optics Corporation proposes a new real-time true 3D (volumetric)
              display, based on switchable binary optical elements (SBOEs). Here, a 2D array
              of surface printed binary optical elements (BOEs) are coated with a rapidly
              switchable liquid crystal layer covering the entire BOE array. A stack of such
              arrays form the volume medium of the display. Each BOE, which forms a volume
              pixel (voxel) element, can be rapidly switched on and off, while a 3 color
              (RGB) low power laser beam is scanned across the display volume. When in an
              unswitched state, the medium will be transparent, while in a switched state,
              the scanning laser beam will be diffracted into a cone shape from the switched
              voxel elements. In order to produce a 3D image, the scanned laser beam is
              modulated while scanned over the BOE plane, which is sequentially switched over
              the whole stack. Using a fast switching Ferroelectric liquid crystal and
              acoustic optic modulators and beam deflectors, a real-time, flicker-free 3D
              volume display can be achieved without any moving parts. This research will
              investigate the feasibility of the proposed concept and lay the groundwork for
              the development of a unique volumetric 3D display for commercial applications.
