Abstract    :
               III-V nitride semiconductor materials technology is important to  the United
              States in the next generation of power semiconductor and short wavelength
              optoelectronics.  However, the quality and availability of substrates -- the
              basis of any semiconductor technology - has not kept pace with either technical
              or commercial requirements.  This SBIR Phase I project, explores the growth of
              single crystal aluminum nitride (AIN) using modified sublimation techniques.  
              In Phase II, the design and process parameters for the production of AIN single
              crystals are expected to be optimized, and high quality AIN single crystal
              substrates will be used for the fabrication of prototype blue LED devices.  A
              fundamental III-V nitride technology advance is expected by correlating growth
              conditions with the occurrence and subsequent elimination of specific defect
              structures.  In Phase III, the grantee expects to scale the crystal growth
              process to enable the manufacture of specific devices and to supply substrates
              in order to accelerate the growth of a III-V nitride based semiconductor
              industry.
