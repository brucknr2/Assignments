Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate
              techniques for dynamic load balancing in parallel finite element analyses. The
              techniques will be particularly suitable for distributed analyses on
              heterogeneous networks.  In the area of high performance computing, significant
              efforts are underway to effectively use the idle computing power of workstation
              networks. One of the key issues in designing algorithms for such systems is
              that of load balancing. The proposed project offers to devise techniques for
              dealing with this problem. The prevalent balancing methods aim to achieve a
              balanced state at discrete instants in time by rebalancing the whole system.
              This project will explore methods to maintain a continually (near) balanced
              state by exploiting balancing opportunities as and when they occur.  Imbalances
              that occur in distributed analyses due to the dynamically varying capabilities
              of participating processors and nonuniform adaptations of meshes (as a result
              of using solution adaptive techniques of analysis) will be dealt with. A
              two-level approach is suggested to efficiently correct these imbalances with
              minimal communication overhead while maintaining the data locality that is so
              important for the efficiency of distributed implementations of finite element
              type discretizations.
