Abstract    :
              Commercial aquaculture of the hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, is practiced
              throughout the Atlantic coast of the United States. The development of this
              industry is based on hatchery produced seed. Growout success is dependent on
              the initial size of the planted seed, predator protection and the timing of
              that planting. Seed placed in the field late in the planting season yields
              variable success. The reasons for the variable success of these late plantings
              has not been investigated, but is believed to be related to the "health" or
              "condition" of the seed. A second, but related source of economic loss is the
              variable success experienced when small clams are overwintered in onshore
              nursery systems. Once seed begin to die, losses can be at a rate of 5% or more
              per day compounded. Such losses impose a large economic burden on clam
              culturists.  The researchers propose developing and testing a method that could
              be used by hatcheries or planters to evaluate the general "condition" of seed
              clams. This technique, once calibrated, could be used to make economic
              decisions on supplemental feeding or other techniques to improve condition of
              the seed.
