Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase I project will explore the potential silver telluride/arsenic
              sulfide, an inorganic resist system, as a photoresist for the new lithographic
              wavelength of 193 nanometers (nm). This system exhibits high contrast, is a
              top-surface imaging resist and exhibits an edge effect not observed in other
              resist systems. All of these features can contribute importantly to the
              lithography of sub 0.5 micron linewidths. High contrast can extend the
              high-frequency capability of a deep UV optical system as well as contribute to
              linewidth control.  Top-surface imaging will permit good lithography with the
              limited depth of focus available from a deep UV lithography system.    The edge
              effect which has only been observed in inorganic resist systems has played an
              important role at longer wavelengths in achieving submicron linewidths.  This
              may play an important role at 193 nm in obtaining sub 0.5 micron linewidths. 
              Having examined the inorganic resists at g-line (436 nm), the proposing firm
              has examined the proposed  system at I-line (365 nm) and measured its
              sensitivity at 193 nm. Results suggest that the proposed system is a reasonable
              candidate for exploration as a 193 nm resist.
