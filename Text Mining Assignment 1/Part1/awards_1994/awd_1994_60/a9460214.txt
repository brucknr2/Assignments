Abstract    :
              For both the United States and the World coal is the most abundant fossil fuel
              but it is also the most polluting. Coal's pollution problems include the
              emissions of NOx, SO2, mercury, submicron particles containing toxic heavy
              metals, carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic compounds, and massive emissions of
              the greenhouse gas CO2. While technologies to limit some of these problems are
              available, they are individually expensive and that expense is additive.
              Gasification of coal with oxygen, CO2, and H20 has been suggested as a
              technology which would solve all of coal's pollution problems, but this
              approach suffers from the high cost of oxygen and from the fact that
              gasification is a slow and hence expensive process. EER has discovered a
              radically new method of combustion which, like oxygen gasification, solves all
              of coal's pollution problems, but without the expense of producing oxygen and
              with greatly reduced cost for the gasification step.
