Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a novel liquid
              photoresist chemistry to produce printed circuit boards (PCBs). This chemistry
              permits 100% solids application, eliminating objectionable solvents used in the
              application of currently available photoresists. The innovative chemistry uses
              a hardener blocked with a reactive component. This hardener is combined with
              suitable monomers, oligomers containing acid (COOH) functionality, polymeric
              binders, photoinitiators and photosensitizers. Following coating the material
              is heated to dissociate the blocked hardener, resulting in a partial cross
              linking of the reactive component, forming a tack-free (B-Stage) surface. The
              coating is patternable with U.V. light which through a free radical
              photoreaction results in selective polymerization of the coating. The unexposed
              material is developed with a 18 sodium or potassium carbonate water solution.
              The patterned photoresist is then used to define the negative image for
              subsequent etching, plating and electroplating. The photoresist is subsequently
              removed by stripping in a 108 sodium or potassium carbonate water solution. 
              This program will demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by demonstrating
              this material on real circuit board substrate at a commercial printed circuit
              board vendor.
