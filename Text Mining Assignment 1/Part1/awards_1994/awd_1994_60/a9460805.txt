Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this proposed work is to study the feasibility and
              build a prototype of a high speed, low-cost, multi-mode 3D ranging system for
              robotics and other applications. The Color-ranger system provides capabilities
              that no other currently available 3D rangefinder achieves. This system is able
              to capture full frame 3D range data at the frame rate of the camera. Therefore,
              it is suitable for high speed, real-time robotics applications. Since there are
              no mechanical moving parts in our Color-ranger system, the mechanical design
              can be very simple and reliable. All components in this system are available
              off-the-shelf which leads to low cost. With the active light source turned on,
              the color camera can provide 3D range data, and with the active light source
              turned off, the same camera provides normal intensity images. This multi-mode
              capability greatly simplifies the problems of multiple sensor integration and
              sensor data fusion. Depending on the applications, the scope of the color
              spectrum of LVWF can be selected from 400 to 750 nm in visible light region.
              The Color-ranger system is not based on a laser therefore there are no eye
              safety problems. This is certainly desirable for wide range of medical
              applications, for collision avoidance in mobile vehicles, and for other
              applications.
