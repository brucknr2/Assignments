Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Project focuses on producing novel
              plastic optical fiber (POF) core materials. The fiber core polymers must be
              transparent in the visible region and in the near IR region of the
              electromagnetic spectra. The proposed concept is to use styrene monomers which
              have bromine and chlorine atoms attached to the polymer side group. These
              halogens increase the refractive index of the polymers and increase near IR
              transparency. Optical, thermal and mechanical properties of the materials will
              be evaluated. This proposal describes novel, but highly feasible ways to design
              optimum fiber core materials. It is a very timely proposal because new light
              sources have altered fiber core transparency requirements. In the past most
              plastic fiber optic devices were coupled to low cost LEDs that operate on the
              650 nm range. PMMA plastic was optimum for these devices because it is
              transparent at 650 nm. The recent development of fast LEDs and inexpensive
              lasers shifted the transparency needs for POFs. Plastics that are transparent
              in the near IR region are now of great interest. PMMA has CH stretch overtones
              in the near infrared that limit its use with the new light sources. A recent
              market study predicts that the market for plastic optical fiber (POF) will
              increase from the current annual level of $50 million worldwide to $264 million
              by 2001.  POFs are used in scientific instruments, nuclear radiation detectors,
              displays, signals, industrial control, data transmission, consumer electronics,
              and medical and automotive lighting applications. Japan is the leader in
              optical fiber production - 90% of the 300,000 km of plastic optical fiber being
              used today was manufactured by Japan. Japan has clearly been more aggressive in
              commercializing high end uses of POF than the U. S. This Phase I research will
              allow OPRI to penetrate this market.
