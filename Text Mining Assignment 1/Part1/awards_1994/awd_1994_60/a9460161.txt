Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
              novel laser pumped helium 4 magnetometer for observation of geomagnetic fields
              and magnetic geophysical exploration. The magnetometer employs a dual mode of
              operation to measure both the magnitude and direction of the geomagnetic field.
              The key technical component is a patented tunable diode laser (TDL) pumping
              process developed by Polatomic for NASA. TDL pumping permits use of a single
              helium cell to measure scalar fields with a projected resolution of 0.1 pT/¬Hz,
              an order of magnitude greater than conventional resonance magnetometers. The
              small sensor and large resonance signals allows extraction of three-axis vector
              information. In Phase I Polatomic, Inc., proposes to define a concept for a
              portable Geomagnetic Vector Scalar (GVS) magnetometer including the sensor and
              electronics modules for high resolution scalar mode and three-axis vector mode.
              They will establish the feasibility of the selected GVS design concept and
              prepare a plan for designing, fabricating and demonstrating a breadboard GVS
              instrument in Phase II.
