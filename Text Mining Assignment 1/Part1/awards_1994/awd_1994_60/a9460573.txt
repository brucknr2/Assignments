Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a novel
              method for bioagent immobilization since the bottleneck of nanotechnology is
              the ability to immobilize proteins or biomolecules on the micro-or nanometer
              scale.  Physical Optics corporation (POC) proposes to utilize the optical
              trapping of latex particles for immunoassay applications.  The novelty of the
              proposed concept is to apply particle trapping capabilities in order to
              manipulate and deposit single or plural latex particles (coated with a reagent)
              for clinical or biomedical sensing applications.  By doing this, a single
              antibody-coated particle (0.1 - 10 micrograms in diameter) can itself become an
              immunosensor.  For a group of particles, a laser device with a scanning
              mechanism can rapidly align and organize a group of particles into any desired
              spatial pattern and dimension.  As a result of this well-defined deposition
              technique, microsensing elements can be fabricated with extreme accuracy,
              sensitivity, and high multiplexity.
