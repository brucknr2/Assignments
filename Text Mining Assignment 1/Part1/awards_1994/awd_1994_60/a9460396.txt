Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate an
              innovative alternate approach to the evaluation of the Coulomb interactions in
              large molecules. Recently there has been a rapidly growing interest in Density
              Functional Theory (DFT) as a general procedure for predicting physical
              properties of molecules, which is relatively inexpensive compared to
              traditional correlated methods. For the largest molecular systems whose study
              is feasible by the current DFT programs (several hundred atoms), the treatment
              of the Coulomb interactions, with its quadratic cost is system size, is
              computationally dominant. In order to be able to perform calculations on truly
              large molecules, a breakthrough in the scaling of the Coulomb contribution is
              required. There is a significant opportunity for considerable advancement
              beyond current technology in this area. Recent research in finite-population
              sampling theory has yielded a breakthrough method, the QCKR algorithm, which
              yields the solution to certain combinatorial problems extremely efficiently
              relative to standard techniques, often affording several orders of magnitude
              improvement. Interestingly, it is possible to express the Coulomb problem in a
              form which is closely related to these combinatorial problems. During the Phase
              I effort, the QCKR method will be extended to solve the Coulomb problem, and
              the potential of the method for facilitating DFT calculations on very large
              molecular systems will be assessed.
