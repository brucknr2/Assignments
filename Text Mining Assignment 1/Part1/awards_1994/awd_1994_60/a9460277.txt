Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
              feasibility of developing a successful state estimation based system for fault
              detection, fault isolation, and service restoration in power distribution
              networks. Electric utilities will use the products to reduce M&O costs due to
              faster and more efficient responses to system outages, increase revenues and
              equipment utilization due to faster service restoration, and defer of capital
              investment due to improved reliability. The major component of the system is
              the three-phase Distribution System State Estimator (DSSE) which will use
              real-time telemetered data, forecasted data, and off-line planning data to
              estimate distribution system voltage magnitudes and angles, feeder flows,
              transformer loadings, and service load injections. The results from DSSE will
              provide the best estimate for the purposes of fault detection, fault isolation,
              and also service restoration. State-of-the-art technologies in the power system
              computer applications and statistics will be used in the deviation of the DSSE.
              The three end-use functions, fault detection, fault isolation and service
              restoration, will also be developed using analytical and rule-based algorithms.
              A special purpose measurement placement algorithm will also be developed to
              ensure the quality of the real-time DSSE solutions.
