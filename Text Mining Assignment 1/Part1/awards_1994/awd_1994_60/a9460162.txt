Abstract    :
              Recently it has been shown in the laboratory that various organic contaminants
              can be mineralized in the aqueous phase using dioxygen over noble metal
              catalysts at temperatures between 120o - 160Ý C. The work to date has been an
              outgrowth of regenerative life support research funded in support of manned
              space exploration. Contaminants studied have been those typical of contaminated
              water streams aboard spacecraft such as hygiene waters, humidity condensates,
              and urine distillates. The organic compounds occurring in highest quantity in
              these contaminated waters are low molecular weight alcohols, carboxylic acids,
              and urea. The experimental results have indicated deep oxidation of mixed
              contaminant streams containing dissolved organic compounds at concentrations
              between 10 - 50 mg/L in a single pass through a plug flow reactor. Studies
              comparing this technique with other methods of organic contaminant reduction
              such as photocatalysis, UV oxidation, and photoelectric oxidation have shown
              heterogeneous catalysis to be vastly more effective in terms of reactor size
              and residence time requirements. The extension of this technique to organic
              contaminants which commonly pollute ground and surface waters is proposed.
              Following demonstration of feasibility in Phase I, the Phase II program will
              study a wider range of contaminants, evaluate alternative oxidants such as
              hydrogen peroxide and ozone, work toward maximization of catalyst activity,
              investigate minimization of vulnerability to catalyst deactivation, and
              optimize reactor design and operational factors.
