Abstract    :
              Current methods used in the manufacturing of advanced composite materials
              contribute to long delivery times and high component costs, and limits
              widespread usage of composites in commercial applications. A new technology has
              been developed for forming silicon carbide using thermal spray techniques in
              open air. The goal of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to investigate this silicon
              carbide forming technology for low cost fabrication of composite structures.
              The sic technology will be evaluated as (1) a surface coating for fiber
              reinforced composites and (2) as a matrix material for incorporating various
              high strength fibers into composite structures. If successful, this technology
              has the potential for an order of magnitude reduction in composite
              manufacturing cost and time. This proposal is a 6 month effort which focuses on
              experimental evaluating using small prototypes to assess technical feasibility.
              The total cost of the Phase I activity is $61,500.00
