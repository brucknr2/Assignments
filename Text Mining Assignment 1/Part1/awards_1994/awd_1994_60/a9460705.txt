Abstract    :
              The objective of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a Photogrammetric Laser
              System (PLS) to significantly reduce the cost of rapidly measuring
              three-dimensional surfaces for civil engineering purposes; to monitor potential
              landslides, seismological measurements, and other ground failures; to rapidly
              assess the results of disasters; and other similar surface measurement
              applications. The reduction in costs is achieved through an integration of
              Global Positioning System (GPS) devices with an approach of performing
              automated stereoscopic measurements using conventional terrestrial
              photogrammetric methods. The unique characteristic of this system is the use of
              a laser to illuminate a small area on the surface being measured to form a
              target. The laser is programmed to scan the surface in a variety of patterns,
              depending upon the type and density of surface information desired. The
              position of the target is automatically determined by the modified stereo
              cameras and recorded simultaneously with a digital image of the scene. The PLS
              produces data that are directly compatible with most three-dimensional data
              processing systems such as: Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Geographic Information
              Systems (GIS), and others. This system greatly increases the speed and accuracy
              of remotely measuring surface data, reduces costs through automatic
              measurements, and does not deviate from conventional photogrammetric processes.
