Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is concerned with the
              research and development of a hand-held biosensor based on immunoassay
              principles. Currently available immunoassay methodologies require sophisticated
              equipment and trained laboratory personnel, and can take up to six hours to
              complete.  Hawaii Biotechnology Group, Inc. proposes to develop a simple device
              which can be used in locations ranging from a sophisticated laboratory to `in
              the field`. The assay system will be based on standard ELISA technology
              performed in a capillary tube, followed by electrochemical analysis. Capillary
              modification, immunoreagent generation, and detection methodology will be
              demonstrated. Further refinements of the device such as prefilter construction
              are expected to increase the specificity of the device. Optimization of the
              various components, will be pursued. As a result of the dimensions of the
              capillaries used, low level detection is expected. The total assay time is
              expected to take 30 minutes and be performed in a semi-automated fashion. For
              commercial reasons we are targeting dengue viral diagnostics as our initial
              device.
