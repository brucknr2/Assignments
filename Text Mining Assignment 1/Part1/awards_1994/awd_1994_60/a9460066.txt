Abstract    :
              Zirconia has been found to produce one of the lowest rates of polyethylene wear
              debris when used with ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene for the
              articulating surface of a prosthesis. A zirconia coating can combine these
              useful surface properties with the well known bulk properties of common medical
              alloys. Due to the lack of chemical cohesion of zirconia with the elements of
              cobalt chromium alloy, even deposition techniques which blend the interface
              between coating and substrate (functionally gradient interface) are not
              producing sufficient adhesion. Implant Sciences Corporation proposes to
              demonstrate that a combination of a chemical bonding layer with fully blended
              interfaces is a solution to the adhesion problem when the layers are formed
              using energetic metal ions of the appropriate species. The proposed coating
              process is omni-directional, has a very high rate of throughput, and is proven
              for large batch commercial production. Orthopedic manufacturers are greatly
              interested in extending the working lifetimes of their total joint replacement
              components. The proposed coating method combines the wear rates of ceramic
              surfaces with the established manufacturing capability of traditional alloy
              prostheses. The combination results in maximum gain in performance for minimum
              cost impact. Several hundred thousand total joint replacement operations are
              performed each year.
