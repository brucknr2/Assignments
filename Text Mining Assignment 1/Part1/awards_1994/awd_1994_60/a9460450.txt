Abstract    :
              Under this proposed research, GWR Instruments, Inc. will introduce to the
              geophysical market a new portable gravimeter with unprecedented sensitivity,
              stability, and extremely low drift rates resulting in fast reading. The
              technical approach uses a quartz constraint to shock harden an existing GWR
              Superconducting Gravity Sensor (SGS). The gravity sensor uses a 3/8` diameter
              niobium sphere levitated in a magnetic field produced by superconducting coils.
              The production of a shock hardened gravity sensor will be an important step
              toward the development of a portable gravity gradiometer in Phase II. A
              portable superconducting vertical gravity gradiometer will be assembled using
              two shock hardened GWR SGSs mounted with their sensitive axes co-linear and
              configured in a differencing signal mode. The success of this research would
              lead to a portable vertical gravity gradiometer at least one or two orders of
              magnitude more sensitive than existing technologies.
