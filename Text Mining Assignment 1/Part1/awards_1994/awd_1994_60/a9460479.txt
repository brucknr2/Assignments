Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop emission
              control strategies based on on-line FT-IR diagnostics and improved combustion
              modeling. Many technologies are emerging for improved incineration of hazardous
              wastes including turbulent spray flames, spouted bed or fluidized bed
              combustors, dump combustors or rotary kilns, and more innovative technologies
              such as plasma torch, circulating combustion bed, and solar assisted
              incineration. For wastes considered hazardous under RCRA, 99.99% DREs are
              required for incineration. Destruction of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are
              also covered under the TSCA, requiring 99.9999% DREs. The environmental impact
              of thermal destruction systems can be compounded by the fact that thermal
              treatment of halogenated wastes may result in the production of secondary
              wastes more toxic than the primary waste. In order to properly control the
              destruction efficiency of thermal treatment systems and prevent potential
              environmental contamination, instrumentation is needed to provide real-time
              control of particulate and volatile air toxics. Current analysis methods rely
              on laboratory procedures which may take up to two months for results, not
              providing any feedback for control or environmental protection. The resulting
              control system will be capable of ensuring that regulated DREs are met and
              environmental health is protected.
