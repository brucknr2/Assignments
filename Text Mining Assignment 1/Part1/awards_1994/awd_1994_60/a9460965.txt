Abstract    :
              Cutting tools form the backbone of manufacturing operations for metals,
              polymers, and advanced materials such as intermetallics and composites of all
              types. Recently, the impetus for manufacturing has increased the focus of many
              overseas companies on efficient methods of manufacturing. Hardness and
              high-temperature strength of the cutting tools increase with a decrease in WC
              particle size and improved dispersion of the hard second phase in the matrix.
              Contiguity of the tungsten carbide grains also plays an important role in the
              tools' performance. Hence, a variety of methods have been proposed to decrease
              the particle size including coprecipitation of tungsten and cobalt and
              subsequent carburization. However, these techniques result in the formation of
              embrittling (-phase complex carbide thereby resulting in inferior mechanical
              properties. In order to solve these problems, Materials Modification Inc.,
              proposes the use of a synergistic combination of novel technologies that can be
              used to tailor properties in cutting tool inserts so that several of the
              problems such as contiguity between WC particles, presence of light elements at
              grain boundaries, and non-uniform matrix distribution will be eliminated. Phase
              I will concentrate on synthesis, consolidation, and evaluation of properties
              while Phase II will focus on further process, optimization, prototype
              development, field evaluation, and coordination with major manufacturers for
              commercialization of this technology.
