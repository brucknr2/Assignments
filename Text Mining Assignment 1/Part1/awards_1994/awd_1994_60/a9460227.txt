Abstract    :
              World-class manufacturing systems of the future will satisfy diverse customer
              demands with extremely low lead times at minimal costs. Virtual manufacturing
              systems will be developed as surrogates for today's manufacturing organization
              to achieve this world-class distinction. This proposed research supports the
              movement toward this goal by investigating the feasibility of the
              `Factory-in-the-Computer`; a decision support/status reporting system which
              integrates status with predictive technologies. The Factory-in-the-Computer
              will be designed to inform different types of managers of current and past
              system status as well as projecting the effect of any decision he or she makes
              in a consistent and understandable manner. Thus, it will have significant
              commercial value to manufacturing companies. In this proposed research,
              Pritsker Corporation will characterize and classify the types of problems for
              which managers require status and predictive information. They will investigate
              how existing data review, interactive graphics, object oriented query, and
              other analysis technologies can be applied to these problem classes. This
              research (Phase I) will lead to a specification for capabilities of the
              Factory-in-the-Computer.
