Abstract    :
              Nanocrystalline materials are stronger, tougher, denser, and more easily
              fabricated than conventional large grain materials. They also offer increased
              strength/corrosion resistance/ electrical conductivity besides significantly
              improved ductility and hardness. They can be sintered and hot pressed to
              theoretical density at lower temperatures and are hence desired in numerous
              structural applications. In this Phase I effort, MMI will use the pulsed
              reactive electrode (PRE) technique that has been developed by MMI to form
              nanocrystalline powders (5 - 100 nm). The powders can be separated using
              standard centrifuge methods and washed to remove any organic ingredients. The
              technique has the possibility to produce unique compositions of nanocomposites
              in large quantities (1-5 kg/hr) that cannot be produced by any of the other
              currently available methods such as sputtering, laser ablation or evaporation.
              The nanopowders will be rapidly compacted using a novel technique that produces
              near theoretical density and retains the original grain size. We will
              demonstrate greatly improved mechanical properties for eventual use in elevated
              temperature applications.
