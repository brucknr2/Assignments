Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for
              improved accuracy in the observation of atmospheric water vapor, temperature,
              and pressure profiles to permit better modeling of the atmosphere for weather
              forecasting. This can be accomplished using Differential Absorption LIDAR
              (DIAL) of water molecules at 1.9 ªm with a narrow bandwidth (ca. 50 MHz),
              tunable infrared diode laser as an injection seed to a Q-switched, solid state
              laser. As the first step in the development of this laser instrumentation,
              pulse amplification of a tunable DFB diode laser over the range from 1.85 ªm to
              1.95 ªm using a solid state amplifier will be investigated. In addition,
              overlap of the solid state laser gain profile with water absorption rotational
              lines suitable for accurate temperature measurements will be investigated. In
              addition to use for obtaining atmospheric water vapor, temperature, and
              pressure profile measurements using the 1.9 ªm water absorption band, the diode
              laser seeding will be an improvement over the current laser technology for use
              in Doppler LIDAR wind measurements operating at 2.01 ªm, which are not tunable
              and require an intricate ring laser as the injection seed.
