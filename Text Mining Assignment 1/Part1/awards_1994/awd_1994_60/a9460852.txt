Abstract    :
              Active magnetic bearings (AMBs) employ electromagnets to levitate the rotor in
              rotating machinery so that it spins without contacting the stator.
              Conventionally, magnetic forces are controlled using feedback from sensors that
              measure shaft position. Although rotor position sensors work well in most
              applications, their cost can be prohibitive. Additionally, it is often
              necessary to operate sensors in extreme environments, which increases sensor
              cost. Sensors also cannot be placed at the same location as the bearings
              (colocation), which can be a source of control problems and even control
              instability. A further disadvantage in utilizing sensors in AMB applications is
              that they increase the number of points of potential failure.  The sensorless
              AMB exploits the fact that the magnetic actuators themselves can act as
              sensors. That is, the relationship between magnetic coil driving current and
              voltage is affected by the electrical inductance, which (ideally) is inversely
              proportional to the clearance between the stator and the rotor. Neural networks
              can learn this nonlinear mapping between the driving current and voltage and
              rotor position. By training the neural network on data from an operating
              machine, the mapping will necessarily also account for the effects of flux
              leakage, magnetization curve nonlinearity, eddy currents, and hysteresis.
