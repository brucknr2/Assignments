Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop
              parallel numerical solution methods for use on distributed computers for
              solution of the model equations encountered in computer codes used in the
              electric utility industry. Computer codes used to perform design and safety
              analysis of electricity generators based on nuclear steam supply systems are an
              integral part of the electric utility industry in the United States. These
              codes typically contain complex two-fluid models for the fluid flow,
              multidimensional neutron kinetics models, one- and multidimensional heat
              conduction modeling, and models for equipment components that make up the steam
              supply system.  The major objective of the proposed research is the development
              and demonstration of numerical solution methods for a parallel computing
              environment made up of distributed workstations. The first objective will be
              parallel solution methods for large matrices. Solution of these matrices
              usually accounts for the largest single share of the CPU time used by the
              codes. Other parts of the numerical solution methods, such as the equation of
              state and engineering correlations for friction and heat transfer, are more
              nearly naturally parallel although load balancing will be required for these
              parts.
