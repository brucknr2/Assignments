Abstract    :
              Avyd Devices proposes to develop a technology to prepare high conductivity
              p-type GaN crystals with an extremely novel and innovative approach. The
              approach entails the creation of shallow acceptor levels via coulombic pairing
              of a double acceptor A--  with a single donor D+ with the resulting pair (A--
              D+)- acting as a single acceptor with an energy level shallower than that of
              either A- or A-- in their unpaired state. Specifically, GaN crystals will be
              simultaneously doped with an element from Group I and an element from Group VI
              and then the crystals will be annealed under well controlled thermodynamic
              conditions which would promote the coulombic association of the Group I element
              occupying gallium lattice sites, acting as a double acceptor, AGa--, with the
              Group VI element occupying nitrogen lattice sites, acting as a single donor,
              DN+. The resulting pair, (AGa-- DN+)- would act as a single acceptor with an
              expected energy level much closer to the valence band edge than that of either
              AGa- or AGa-- in their unpaired state. Phase I research will focus on
              demonstrating the feasibility of coulombic pairing as an approach to produce
              high conductivity p-type GaN. At the end of Phase II of the program, Avyd
              Devices expects to reproducibly produce high conductivity p-type GaN and high
              power blue LEDs for commercial applications. The technology can also be
              extended to Ga1-x Alx N alloys to produce solar blind detectors.
