Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes new
              electrochemical measurements in supercritical water environments for material
              corrosion studies. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is a unique and
              promising approach for neutralizing a wide variety of wastes. However, the SCWO
              reactors are susceptible to corrosion failure leading to contamination of the
              effluent stream with corrosion products or catastrophic failure of the reactor
              itself. In order for SCWO reactor technology to be scaled up and commercially
              implemented, in-situ/real-time corrosion monitors are required. The proposed
              measurements will yield the basic information necessary for corrosion sensor
              development for SCWO reactors. The Phase I program will demonstrate the
              feasibility of an in-situ/real-time corrosion monitor for SCWO reactor by
              correlating our measurement technique with weight loss measurements. This
              provides the basis for further development of two sensing methodologies for
              continuous monitoring of corrosion in SCWO reactors. The corrosion monitoring
              in real time is essential for SCWO reactors for (a) scale-up, safe, and longer
              operation, (b) optimization of process parameters for maximum waste stream
              treatment, (c) elimination of effluent stream contamination with corrosion
              products, and d) avoidance of catastrophic failures.
