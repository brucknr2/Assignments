Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a
              low-cost thermal process for commercially producing nano-alloys. Nano-alloys
              are a broad new class of nonequilibrium materials with unprecedented
              microstructures (and novel properties) that have been artificially modulated in
              zero to three dimensions on scales less than 100 nm. These materials are
              gaining much attention owing to their considerable commercial potential both in
              monolithic materials and in device applications. The ultimate realization of
              the commercial potential and the rate at which the applications develop
              significantly depends on the availability and the price of nano-alloys. This in
              turn depends on the development of an economical process to produce nano-alloys
              in commercially viable quantities. Nanomaterials Research Corporation proposes
              to demonstrate such a process. The program's technical approach is to
              synthesize nano-alloys by controlled particulate growth in a proprietary
              venturi reactor followed by adiabatic termination of the growth process. The
              significant advantages of such a route are: continuous production, robust
              process control, higher yield and selectivity, minimal energy costs and
              product-flexibility. They expect to establish the proof-of-concept of the
              process during Phase I (their focus: TiFe and MgNi), optimize the process and
              commercialize a wide range of nano-alloys in research/test quantities during
              Phase II, and during Phase III, commercialize nano-alloys in bulk quantities.
