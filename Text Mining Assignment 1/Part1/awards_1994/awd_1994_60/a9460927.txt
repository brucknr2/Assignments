Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a technique
              for automated monitoring of SNMP data. Profiles of behavior for many variables
              defined in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Internet Management
              Information Base (MIB I and II) will be constructed and evaluated using
              statistical analysis. In our exploratory analysis, data for selected variables
              will be collected at 15 second intervals for devices attached to a university
              LAN and downloaded for later analysis. Methods will be employed to handle the
              noisy or bursty nature of the variables and to deal with the dynamic and
              non-stationary aspects. The techniques we develop are likely to be applicable
              to diagnostic problems in many other industries that face non-stationary,
              highly complex behaviors in the data that can be monitored. Even if the
              research is not successful and Intellinet, Inc., is unable to identify profiles
              or multivariate measures with sufficiently stable predictive power, the results
              of this work and the methodologies they examine will benefit the research
              community. Moreover, data that they collect concerning the behavior of a broad
              class of SNMP variables in both normal and faulty conditions and the relative
              predictive power of these variables are likely to be of value to network
              operators and device manufacturers in the future.
