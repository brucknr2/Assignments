Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves research in the
              area of synthesis and processing of advanced superconducting ceramic materials.
              The principal objective of the proposed work is to optimize the stoichiometry,
              phase composition, morphology, and other characteristics of high-temperature
              superconducting ceramic (HTSC) powders used to produce high-quality single
              crystals having high critical current densities necessary for flux-trapping
              applications. An important additional objective is to contribute to the
              development of an improved understanding of certain crystal growth process
              parameters thought to be of prime importance in controlling growth rates and
              single crystal properties. The work will be concentrated on YBa2Cu3O7 (123)
              materials known to have useful superconducting properties and which have
              already been successfully fabricated as single crystals, both in the United
              States and in Japan. The powders will be produced using a proven combustion
              spray pyrolysis (CSP) method capable of providing high-purity, ultra-fine,
              stoichiometric powders with consistent reproducibility. Y2BaCuO5 (211) powders
              used in the growth of 123 single crystals, as well as 123/211 composite
              compositions, will also be produced. The recognized role of small additions of
              platinum to the crystal growth process will be explored by examining
              appropriate means for introducing the metal into the precursor powders.
              Required modifications to the CSP process required to produce preferable
              precursor powders will be established. Selected powders will be used in
              subsequent single crystal growth experiments (modified Czochralski growth
              method) to be conducted at Princeton University. Single crystal growth
              technology will be transferred from Princeton University to SSC, Inc. for
              continuing development and eventual commercialization as progress warrants.
