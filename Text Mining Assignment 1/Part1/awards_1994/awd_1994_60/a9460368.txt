Abstract    :
              The Virtual Model Interlocking (VMI) concept is created to describe geometric
              objects and their relationships with maximum flexibility in topologic
              definition, geometric relations and heterogeneous information for complicated
              engineering processes, such as concurrent engineering, manufacturing processes,
              assembly analyses, and geometric reasoning. The Virtual Model Interlocking
              system is based on a new non-manifold modeling in Boundary Representation
              (B-Rep) topology, which allows detached components, partial topology or pseudo
              objects (Virtual Model). Each face, edge, and vertex in the topology can be
              interlocked to a construction plan, parameter-driven dimension, or graphic
              rule. These attached relationships can modify the orientation and position of
              the solid object, the solid topology and its dimensions by the changes
              propagated from other objects. VMI provides a modeling framework for engineers
              to describe single or groups of objects with incomplete topology during the
              design process. The current Solid Modeling systems are commonly used to
              describe 3-D objects with Boolean operations. These solid models are difficult
              to create and difficult to manipulate, and all the geometry entities within the
              solid topology cannot be accessed or manipulated directly. Virtual Model
              Interlocking is developed as a design and manufacturing tool to remove these
              restrictions.
