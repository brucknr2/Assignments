Abstract    :
              Novel phosphoramidite reagents are proposed which will be used to incorporate
              gold cluster complexes and combined fluorescent/gold labels into
              oligonucleotides during automated solid state synthesis. The labels will be
              synthetically modified to withstand the synthesis and deprotection conditions.
              Gold and fluorescent/gold conjugated phosphoramidites will be prepared in forms
              specific for labeling at the 5' end of the oligonucleotide, at the 3' end via
              derivatization of a controlled pore glass support, and at any intermediate
              position; the synthesis of an adenosine phosphoramidite labeled in the 2'
              position is also proposed. The labels will be incorporated into oligonucleotide
              probes which will be tested in hybridization studies on blots, and in situ
              electron microscopy hybridization studies. The sensitivity, penetration and
              resolution of the labeled nucleotides will be evaluated relative to analogous
              biotinylated probes detected by a secondary probe bearing the same label. It is
              anticipated that synthetic probes which incorporate the new labels will achieve
              unprecedented resolution in the electron microscope, and blot sensitivities
              equal to or better than current radioisotopic or chemiluminescent techniques.
