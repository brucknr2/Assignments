Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
              potential for a one to two order of magnitude improvement in three-dimensional
              (3-D) image reconstructions by applying an innovative parallel-processing
              architecture to the NSF-  developed VOIR?  and other 3-D image reconstruction
              algorithms. By drastically reducing reconstruction time, the Image Matrix
              Processor (IMP) will remove a major obstacle in the development of
              high-resolution medical and industrial 3-D CT.  The IMP operates on matrices
              the way an array processor operates on vectors. Designed to be installed in an
              expansion slot of a high-end workstation, the IMP makes it possible for the
              first time to perform rapid volumetric reconstructions and 3-D segmentations of
              large data sets, such as those generated by computed tomography (CT) or
              magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. The IMP's architecture will also
              support the volumetric visualization and real-time manipulation of large 3-D
              images, providing an ideal desktop environment for scientific and medical
              applications of the future.   The Phase I Program will do a step-by-step
              microcode simulation of an IMP processor running 3-D CT reconstruction
              algorithms to demonstrate that, using commercially available technology, an
              affordable IMP/workstation could be capable of performing 5123 reconstructions
              in less than 2-hours. A conceptual design of an IMP/workstation architecture
              capable of meeting this goal will be developed. The Phase III commercial goal
              is to offer an affordable, workstation-based capability (IMP/workstation) with
              the power to reconstruct 10243 images in less than 2 hours.
