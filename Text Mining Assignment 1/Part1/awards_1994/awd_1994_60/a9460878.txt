Abstract    :
              9460878  Nardi    This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project deals 
              with development of novel neural algorithms for adaptive  demodulation of
              spread spectrum communications.  Direct-Sequence  Spread-Spectrum
              Multiple-Access (DS/SSMA) has long been the  technology of choiae in a wid
              evariety of satellite and military  radio networks where multiple-access
              capabilities, anti-jamming,  low probability of interceptm, and dynamic
              topologies are  important.  DS/SSMA technology is emerging as a likely
              modulation  choice in emerging space and third-generation commercial mobile 
              radio networks (e.g. personal communication systems) and in  indoor wireless
              communications.  The performance degradation  casused by the dissimilarity of
              the received powers of a set of  users who transmit simultaneously through the
              same channel.  Multiuser detection promises substantial gains in
              bit-error-rate,  which in turn afford the possibility of eliminating the need
              for  power control and a significant reduciton in the number of chips- 
              per-symbol (spreading ratio) necessary to sustain a desired level  of multiuser
              capability.  Neural algorithms are naturally suited  to the training and
              adaptation of multiuser detection algorithms  to realize those gains in
              practice.  The proposed project will  develop neural-network-based adaptive
              signal processing  architectures for near-far-resistant demodulation of spread-
               spectrum multiple-access signals.  This approach will lead to  significant
              advances in the ability to use direct-sequence spread-  spectrum formats in
              emerging radio networks    ***
