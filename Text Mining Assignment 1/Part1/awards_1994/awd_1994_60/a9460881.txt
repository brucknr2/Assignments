Abstract    :
              The need for faster, smaller, and more efficient electronic devices has grown
              considerably owing to the miniaturization of a variety of electronic
              components. Hence, computer chips and other microelectronic components are
              currently undergoing an explosive growth in the number of devices packed per
              unit area. As the packaging density (number of devices) of these
              microelectronic devices advances from very large scale integration (VLSI) to
              ultra-large scale integration (ULSI), the heat dissipated by these devices has
              also increased substantially. This has necessitated the research and
              development of low thermal expansion/high thermal conductivity composites for
              thermal management applications. In this Phase I effort, Materials
              Modification, Inc. will develop nanocrystalline tungsten-based (W-Cu)
              composites using a dual stage process followed by rapid consolidation. Phase I
              will focus on optimization of synthesis, consolidation, and characterization of
              the properties. Phase II will concentrate on optimization of
              process-structure-property parameters and the production and testing of
              prototypes (substrates) in both laboratory and field equipment in conjunction
              with two major manufacturers. Coordination has already been initiated with each
              of these manufacturers for this effort.
