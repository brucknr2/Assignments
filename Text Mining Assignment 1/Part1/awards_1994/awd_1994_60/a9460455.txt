Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project examines holographic
              data storage based on photorefractive recording materials as a promising
              approach to overcoming the present I/O bottleneck that exists between
              high-speed microprocessors and mass storage peripherals. Many of the needed
              optical systems components (SLMs, CCDS, and tunable diode-lasers) are now
              available with sufficient performance specifications; however, the lack of a
              suitable volume recording medium is the primary problem. The medium should
              possess high sensitivity, large dynamic range, and a reliable mechanism for
              nondestructive readout. No single material to date satisfies all of these
              important criteria. Com:One Devices, Inc., proposes to overcome this limitation
              by using novel doping schemes to provide optimized two-photon photorefractive
              recording. Evaluation of the dopants is based on detailed spectroscopic and
              photoconductivity measurements. This approach is designed to provide a viable
              two-photon recording material that will ultimately be used in a
              first-generation read-write mass storage demonstration device.
