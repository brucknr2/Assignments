Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to prepare a
              new class of ultrafast, efficient phosphor and scintillator materials. To
              regain the competitive edge in displays, the phosphors must be fast and
              efficient at low voltages and high currents. The efficient and ultrafast
              phosphors developed by Nanocrystals Technology (NCT), will improve the above
              properties significantly. The NCT will develop efficient and ultrafast blue,
              green and red line-emitting rare-earth doped nanocrystalline (DNC) phosphors.
              The unique properties of the DNC phosphors could lead to a cost-effective,
              flat-slim, bright display with high-contrast and high-resolution. In addition
              to display applications, the ultrafast speed in efficient DNC phosphors can
              lead to extremely fast scintillator materials. During the proposed Phase I
              effort, NCT will develop and characterize the visible line-emitting phosphors
              using room temperature chemical preparative techniques. The extension of this
              work to Phase II will include the performance evaluation of these phosphors in
              display and scintillator systems.
