Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has the potential to
              substantially reduce the mean cycle-time as well as the variance of cycle-times
              in semiconductor integrated circuit manufacturing plants. Semiconductor
              manufacturing plants possess a special type of re-entrant process flow that is
              unlike that found in traditional manufacturing operations such as flow shops
              and job shops. This project proposes the development of new scheduling policies
              based on what we call the First Law of Queueing Systems, that reducing
              fluctuations in flows reduces delay. In preliminary studies these policies have
              shown the ability to reduce mean waiting time by about 20% and standard
              deviation cycle-time by 40% on single process flow plants. The scheduling
              algorithms will address issues related to batch operations and set-up times in
              addition to the diverse random disruptions occurring in a production facility.
              The performance of this new class of scheduling policies will be evaluated
              through the development of a stand-alone simulation environment that will
              incorporate realistic models of semiconductor production facilities.
