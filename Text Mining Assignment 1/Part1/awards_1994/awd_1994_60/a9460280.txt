Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the use
              of Forward Error Correction and robust fault handling in order to improve the
              performance of MPEG-1 encoded audio and video transport in multicast computer
              networks. The advent of MPEG-1 has resulted in a standard method for
              compressing audio and VCR-quality, 30-frame/s, full-motion video information to
              1.5 Mbits/sec for CD-ROM usage. The natural extension to the transport of
              MPEG-1, and in particular the multicast of MPEG-1, over computer networks
              reveals a new set of issues. Decoding of compressed audio and video is
              extremely sensitive to lost data. Selective retransmission may result in
              latencies which are incompatible with interactive applications such as virtual
              reality. An innovative approach is required which combines Forward Error
              Correction and robust lost data handling to achieve the multiple goals of low
              latency, minimal lost data, maximum bandwidth utilization, and highest possible
              image quality. This Phase I effort will design a transport protocol based on an
              analysis of the characteristics of MPEG-1 traffic and experiments into the
              effects of errors on MPEG-1 image quality. The project will also include a
              development plan for testing in a multicast network to verify performance and
              robustness under multimedia applications.
