Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the
              exploratory development of electrochemical machining (ECM) technology based on
              the employment of dispersed microparticles in aqueous electrolytes. The
              methodology utilizes suspended particles of C, WC, Ag, or zeolite Y
              incorporating Ag, in aqueous solutions containing compatible supporting
              electrolytes such as NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaClO3, NaBrO3, NaOH and NaNO3. These
              electrolyte mixtures will be used in the ECM of selected refractory materials.
              Materials to be studied during Phase I will include W, Ta, Mo, Nb, WC, Inconel
              718 and Hastelloy C. Enhanced ECM performance will result because the suspended
              particles will function as microelectrodes in the applied electric field, and
              exhibit microscopic electrical-discharge phenomena. This will result in
              perturbation of the local ionic and chemical environments in the presence of
              microparticles which will enhance the ECM process. Thus, the presence of
              suspended electronically conductive microparticles in the electrolyte is
              anticipated to mitigate catastrophic sparking, Joule heating, cathode
              polarization, and anode shape changes due to these effects. Additionally, it is
              expected that resulting surface tolerances will be on the scale of
              microparticles. The approach is not expected to require significant
              modification of hardware used with current aqueous electrolyte based
              technologies.
