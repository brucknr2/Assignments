Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project shall develop a
              computational sensor array for 2D real-time acquisition and tracking of moving
              objects. The Phase I prototype system is implemented in CMOS VLSI and consists
              of a foveated, spatially variant array of photoreceptors (retina) with
              resistive coupling for contrast (edge) detection, circuits for the measurement
              of local, directional motion velocity in the foveal array and circuits for the
              acquisition and tracking of a moving object boundary. The velocity signal
              generated in the fovea is independent of illumination and contrast. The sensor
              is fitted with appropriate optics and mounted on an electromechanical
              positioning assembly which in tracking mode sets the relative velocity of the
              target and retina to zero. The acquisition signal codes the location of
              temporal changes of contrast in the periphery and serves to position the retina
              such that the moving feature is projected on the fovea. The retina and the
              ancillary circuits are placed on a single chip and the entire system, including
              the positioning mechanism, could be housed in a volume of less than two cubic
              inches.
