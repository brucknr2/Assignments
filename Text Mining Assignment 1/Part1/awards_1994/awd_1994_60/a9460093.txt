Abstract    :
              The unique product described in this proposal has the potential to greatly
              improve the current procedures used to obtain hemostasis and control trauma
              during invasive surgery. It is estimated that by 1998 there will be in excess
              of 1.5 million surgical procedures that will use some type of hemostatic
              device. Currently, there are no products on the market that adequately address
              all the surgeon's needs. The major complaint is that present devices cannot be
              effectively sutured or stapled in place. This is due to the low tensile
              strength and poor tear resistance of the materials. It is the objective of this
              program to prepare bioresorbable laminated structures that can be sutured in
              place and provide a high degree of support to traumatized organs and tissues.
              The program will involve an initial screening of bioresorbable polymers as well
              as a preliminary investigation into the best methods of attaching the
              reinforcing polymer film to the rather delicate collagen hemostat. Once this
              screening process is completed the best candidates will be tested in vivo under
              surgical conditions. If the Phase I study is funded, Kensey Nash Corporation
              will be able to move to Phase II which will include an evaluation of polymer
              structures and collagen pore sizes (lyophilization technique) relative to the
              overall tensile strength of the device.
