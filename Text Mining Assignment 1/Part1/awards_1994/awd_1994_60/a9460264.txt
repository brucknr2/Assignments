Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to demonstrate
              the viability of an innovative, compact and very cost effective rectangular
              discharge geometry for CO2 lasers with output powers in the 25 to 150 watt
              range. The proposed discharge geometry requires only five intravacuum elements
              and employs low frequency, transverse RF excitation. Therefore the reduced
              parts and fabrication cost enjoyed by this device approach has the potential to
              expand the size of the CO2 laser market via increasing device performance
              without a corresponding price increase. QSource believes this proposal concerns
              an innovation that falls within the `National Critical Technologies` definition
              as described in Section 1.3 of the Solicitation. The specific Phase I
              experimental goals will be to demonstrate a laser output of 36 W with a
              discharge efficiency of 15% using existing proof-of-principle hardware. This
              level of device performance has been identified by our potential Phase III
              partner as that required for a future medical laser product.
