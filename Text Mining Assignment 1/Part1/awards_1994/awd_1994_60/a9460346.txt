Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will: determine
              variables important to quality control of DNA sequencing such as error
              dependency on sequence content; design optimal testing protocols and sampling
              plans for assessing precision and accuracy of DNA sequencing laboratories; and
              develop methods for predicting insertion and deletion errors (frameshifts) in
              sequence data. The power of statistical tests will be studied using results for
              sequencing combinatorially designed, synthetic DNA fragments. This
              investigation will be based on theoretical analysis, computer simulations, and
              on data provided through our collaboration with the Yeast Genome Center at
              Stanford University.  The growing use of DNA sequence data in research, 
              databases, diagnostic and therapeutic biotechnology, and even litigation
              requires that the quality of data being used by objectively assessable. The
              proposed research addresses the following problems associated with sequence
              data:  the inability to associate consistent, quantitative error rate estimates
              with sequence data; the concomitant lack of quality control on the sequence
              data; and the inability to make informed decisions balancing cost per base of
              different methods (or laboratories) against the relative stringency of quality
              requirements imposed on different sequencing tasks.
