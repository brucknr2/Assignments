Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a new,
              advanced, rapid nondestructive inspection technique for use on composite
              materials during manufacturing and in-service inspection. Composite materials
              are rapidly becoming strong, lightweight substitutes for a great variety of
              traditional metallic structural components. However, composites are often
              difficult to inspect for discontinuities or impact damage due to their high
              electrical resistivity and/or high ultrasonic attenuation. It is proposed that
              composites be tagged during manufacturing with trace quantities of magnetic
              powders in the binding matrix and/or with ferromagnetic or electrically
              conducting wire screens among the fiber layers - such screens are already
              commonly employed in existing aerospace composites for deicing heaters and
              lightning protection. It is further proposed that an electrically noncontacting
              magneto-optic/eddy current imaging system, the MOI, then be used to form
              rapidly scanned, real-time images of voids and impact damage deliberately
              introduced into these materials. With an appropriate choice of tagging
              materials, composite samples and controlled experiments involving the MOI and
              SQUID magnetometers, Physical Research, Inc., will demonstrate the feasibility
              of rapidly imaging and detecting otherwise hidden discontinuities and impact
              damage.
