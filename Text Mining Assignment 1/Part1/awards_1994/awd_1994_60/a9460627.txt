Abstract    :
              Acorn NMR proposes to create a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer
              "flight simulator" which would run on a personal computer. This would be used
              as a teaching tool, so that students could explore the effects of numerous data
              acquisition parameters on the resulting data without monopolizing expensive
              instrument time. All major aspects of instrument control could be included, as
              well as data processing and interactive spectral interpretation. Such a
              teaching tool would give students a solid understanding of NMR spectroscopy
              which does not depend on access to an actual spectrometer. The Simulator will
              build on Acorn NMR's existing software products to form a complete educational
              package. Their existing PC-based software includes a comprehensive NMR data
              processing program and an NMR shimming simulation program.
