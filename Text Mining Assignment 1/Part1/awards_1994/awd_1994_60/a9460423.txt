Abstract    :
              The control of electric motors using intelligent techniques is important in
              improving the motor's efficiency, to make alternative fuel vehicles a realistic
              consumer option. Until recently, electric motors used in automotive
              applications were not designed to operate at their peak efficiency at various
              output torques, and mechanical transmissions can consume a lot of the energy.
              Recent improvements in motor technology would permit motors to function at or
              near peak efficiency for a wide variety of parameters. However, the parameters
              are varying constantly, so that only an adaptive control scheme would be able
              to achieve such efficiency. ORINCON proposes to develop an artificial neural
              network (ANN) model reference control scheme that will adapt the motor to
              behave in the most efficient manner possible given the current conditions.
              Unlike most ANNs, this neuro-controller will be trained on-line using an
              extended Kalman filter trainer that has shown great potential.
