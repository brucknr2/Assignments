Abstract    :
              Hundreds of thousands of orthopedic implantations are performed each year in the
              U.S., yet failure rates of these replacements remain significant. Second
              generation cementless prostheses, the hopeful alternative to
              poly-methylmethacrylate fixation, have not fulfilled their promise of long term
              stability. The cause remains essentially the same: differential stress at the
              bone-implant interface which impairs osteointegration and results in the
              formation of particulate debris and the reactive formation of poorly defined
              and mechanically unstable fibrous tissue. Lynntech, Inc., proposes to develop a
              bioelectronic coating for porous prostheses which combines the osteoconductive
              properties of a biological matrix with a piezoelectric polymer (polyvinylidene
              difluoride) that has proven osteoinductive capability. It is anticipated that
              this combination will not only lead to improved initial osteointegration of
              implants, but that PVDF, being bioinert, will remain associated with newly
              formed tissue at the bone-implant interface. Being permanently piezoelectric,
              it may then provide the basis for response to changes in stress at this
              interface by electrically stimulating further bone remodeling. The result would
              be a prosthetic surface capable of active response to a dynamic environment,
              thus decreasing failure rates.
