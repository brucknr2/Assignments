Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore the
              feasibility of building a practical tool for software maintenance based on
              theory. Maintenance presently consumes most of the lifecycle costs of most
              software, yet current methods used for this work are at best ad hoc. Building
              on a formal theory of Transformational Maintenance by Design Reuse 0, Semantic
              Designs (SD) intends to demonstrate, by construction and validation, the
              utility of a semantics-based Design Maintenance System (MS) in installing
              incremental changes to software for functionality, performance and portability.
               DMS would enable a nearly continuous software modification process, unifying
              both software design and software maintenance activities. While the theory 
              requres software generated transformationally from a specification, DMS would
              be augmented with (transformational) design recovery mechanisms to enable  its
              application to existing code.   During the SBIR Phase I research effort, SD
              will establish the feasibiity  of a practical DMS by designing `nonlinear`
              transformation dependency networks, choosing suitable internal representations
              for code schemas and translation methods for converting code transformations
              to/from those schemas, defining an initial ar chiteture for the DMS, and
              evaluating it by manual  simulation on sample real codes.
