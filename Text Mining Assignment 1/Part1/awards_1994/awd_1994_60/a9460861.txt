Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is an investigation of
              two-phase (slackline) flow in pipelines. The objective is to develop a simple,
              robust, numerical model of slack-line flow which can be incorporated into
              real-time transient simulations of pipeline flow used for leak detection, batch
              tracking, and inventory management. An approximate theoretical model of
              slack-line flow will be developed which makes use of known (or suspected)
              features of slack-line flow which makes it simpler than the general two-phase
              flow problem. The assumptions of the model regarding the two-phase topology
              will be checked by a laboratory experiment with small, clear pipes in which
              slack-line flow can be created and controlled. The model will be programmed for
              numerical integration in conjunction with a single-phase model for the rest of
              the pipeline. The numerical results will be checked against a rigorous
              transient two-phase flow model which has already been developed. Experiments
              will be conducted with an operating pipeline on which slack-line flow can be
              created by the operators, with the objective of testing the accuracy of the
              slack-line flow model in calculating bubble growth and shrinkage rates. It is
              anticipated that the model will be correct, or correctable by minor adjustments
              of parameters.
