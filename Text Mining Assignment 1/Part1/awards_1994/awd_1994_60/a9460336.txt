Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to determine the
              feasibility of a novel turbine, forced convection reactor for high rate
              synthesis of diamond by chemical vapor deposition. The low growth rate of
              diamond by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the largest factor hindering the
              commercialization of CVD diamond products. Based on experimental and computer
              simulated results from a rotating substrate hot-filament assisted CVD reactor
              and an oxy-acetylene torch reactor, the rate of diamond growth is limited by
              the rate of mass transport of growth species to the diamond surface. Phase I
              work is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of high rate diamond growth by
              increased mass transfer rates in a turbine, forced convection CVD reactor. The
              scope of this work includes: 1) designing and building a turbine, forced
              convection CVD reactor, and 2) performing experiments to demonstrate an order
              of magnitude increase in diamond growth rates. Increased mass transport, i.e.,
              forced convection, will be achieved by using a turbine to pump process gas from
              the activation zone, i.e., the filament, to the substrate. Experiments will
              concentrate on both standard and non-standard conditions known by the proposer
              to grow good quality diamond. Computer modeling of the fluid mechanics and mass
              transport rates will support the experimental program. The proposed work will
              be performed by one full-time engineer at North Coast Crystals, Inc. and one
              subcontract by Case Western Reserve University to perform the computer
              modeling.
