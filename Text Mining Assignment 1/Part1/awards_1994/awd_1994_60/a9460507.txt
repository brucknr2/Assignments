Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the development
              of an innovative air pollution control device for the destruction and removal
              of hazardous chemical compounds from industrial stack emissions. Currently, air
              pollution control technologies are limited either by cost per pound of
              pollutant destroyed (thermal oxidation) or by space requirements (catalytic
              oxidation). The proposed process will very efficiently oxidize hazardous air
              pollutants to such innocuous by-products as CO2, HCl, and H2O and other easily
              scrubbed compounds. These hazardous air pollutants will be oxidized by reaction
              with oxidative free radicals which are generated by the application of
              microwave radiation and formed in the stack. Radical injection techniques are a
              promising strategy for air pollution control and abatement. Phase I will entail
              the development of a novel concept: gas phase injection of a single oxidative
              chemical radical to completely oxidize halohydrocarbons which are present in
              the stack of an actual ground water pump and treat system. A full-scale process
              model will be constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of the oxidative
              process. Experimental data currently available from the literature and chemical
              kinetics calculations show that chemical radical oxidation is a very effective
              technique for the complete oxidation of most hazardous air pollutants. Finally,
              this experiment will provide critical data such as radical lifetimes, reaction
              rates, and control efficiencies which can be used to design a variety of
              control systems.
