Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to design and
              test a tailored composite sacrificial anode for galvanic cathodic protection
              systems for reinforced and prestressed concrete. This anode system can be
              tailored for each application to provide the desired performance
              characteristics by changing the composition and form of the finished composite.
              The composite sacrificial anode will contain all of the necessary components in
              a single unit, minimizing the need for special installation procedures.
              Galvanic cathodic protection systems have not been extensively developed for
              corrosion control of reinforced concrete due to voltage and current limitations
              of single-component solid metal ribbon or plate anodes. Interest has been
              renewed due to the need for cost-effective rehabilitation of the nation's
              deteriorating infrastructure. Galvanic cathodic protection is also being
              considered for prestressed concrete structures to avoid risk of hydrogen
              embrittlement caused by overprotection of the steel by electrically driven
              systems. The focus of the proposed program will be on development and testing
              of composite sacrificial anodes in wet alkaline sand and 3 m concrete slabs for
              galvanic protection of reinforcing steel and prestressing wires. The effects of
              fabrication methods, anode composition, physical characteristics and form, and
              concrete chemistry on galvanic performance will be evaluated.
