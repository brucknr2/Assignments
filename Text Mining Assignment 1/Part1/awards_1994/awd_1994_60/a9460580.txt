Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will apply emerging
              multispectral acousto-optic imaging technology and a specially devised
              unsupervised learning neural network to enhance microscopic imaging. Various
              spectral systems employing fluorescence, absorption, and Raman effect are
              currently in wide use in the microscopic investigation of biological
              structures. Physical Optics Corporation's R&D Division proposes to develop a
              novel spectrally adaptive system to enhance image quality and to improve the
              amount of light collected by an imaging camera as compared with single line
              filtering. At the same time, the signal-to-noise ratio will be drastically
              reduced since the system's spectral response will automatically be matched to
              the spectrum of the object of interest. The proposed system will also reduce
              the required observation time and the illumination of the sample under test,
              permitting real-time tracking of dynamic events in the sample without its being
              damaged by intensive illumination.
