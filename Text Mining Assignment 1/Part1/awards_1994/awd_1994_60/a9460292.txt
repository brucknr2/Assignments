Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to use the
              solubilized membrane as the electrolyte in internally humidified proton
              exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and to develop a rapid method for its
              application on electrodes. The solubilized membrane forms tenacious deposits on
              electrodes and have the desirable properties of an electrolyte for the said
              purpose. The research objective is to develop an appropriate and rapid method
              for application of electrolyte on electrodes. The method of brushing produces
              nonuniform deposits. The method of spraying can be developed as a viable method
              that can be made rapid and automated. Two solubilized membranes of different
              equivalent weights will be used in the experiment. The quality and
              characteristics of the electrolyte deposits will be evaluated in 25 and 50 cm2
              active electrode area fuel cells and also in a three-cell stack. Cells will be
              tested without external humidification at 30-70ÝC and 0-20 psig pressure. Fuel
              cells will be assembled with a proprietary plastic film gasket that will be
              placed symmetrically around the electrode edges. Estimation will be made on the
              amount of active Pt surface area and the extent of cross-leaks, if any, across
              a fuel cell. Anticipated benefits include the availability of a high
              performance polymer electrolyte for the PEMFC and the use of much less
              electrolyte material for the fuel cell.
