Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is designed to evaluate
              the use of One Cell Systems' microencapsulation technology in the assessment of
              transfected cells. The current commercial importance of genetically modified or
              transfected cells in the development of vaccines, diagnostics or drug delivery
              systems as well as the treatment of malignant, infectious and genetic diseases
              is well recognized. Obtaining and characterizing a pure population of
              transfected cells or evaluating the efficacy of different transfection methods
              usually requires including a drug-resistance gene and clone selection. The
              ability to encapsulate single cells into agarose microdrops would allow the
              expression of the desired protein to be measured in individual cells using
              automated methods such as flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell
              sorting. This proposal is designed to determine the feasibility of using the
              encapsulation system to evaluate transfected cells. These initial studies will
              utilize two different transfected cell lines; a Chinese hamster ovary cell line
              (CHO l-l5500.  ATCC CRL 9609) which secretes tissue plasminogen activator and a
              mouse mammary line (CSM a  b lH, ATCC CRL 8401) secreting human chorionic
              gonadotropin. Successful completion of these phase I studies would provide the
              basis for the development of a new and potentially more efficient technology
              for the evaluation and selection of transfected cells.
