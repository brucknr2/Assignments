Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a new approach
              to the growth of large-area, low-cost, high-quality beta silicon carbide
              ((-SiC) epitaxial layers grown on silicon wafers. The proposed process is based
              on a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth technique. In VLS growth, a solvent layer
              is supplied with carbon by reaction with vapor-phase hydrocarbons, while
              epitaxial growth occurs from the liquid phase. Thus, the process may be viewed
              as a hybrid CVD/LPE technique. To overcome the 20% lattice mismatch, a thin (10
              to 100 nm) (-SiC buffer layer is formed on a silicon substrate using a chemical
              conversion process. This approach has many potential advantages that stem from
              the hybrid nature of the technique. It combines many of the advantages of
              liquid-phase epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition. An important feature of
              this technique is the flexibility with which doped epitaxial layers can be
              grown. Beta silicon carbide is widely recognized as the most promising
              semiconductor material for high-temperature electronics and high-power
              microwave electronic devices.
