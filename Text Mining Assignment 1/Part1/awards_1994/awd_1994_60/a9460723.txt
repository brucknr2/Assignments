Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the
              feasibility of developing a series of tools which can be used in the submission
              of a Computer Assisted New Drug Application (CANDA). The United States Food and
              Drug Administration (FDA) was created to control the testing and approval of
              new drugs for marketing to protect individuals from harmful compounds. This
              process has contributed significantly to the increase to the cost in developing
              a new drug to between $125 million and $500 million, requiring as many as ten
              to twelve years before it can be introduced into the market. The implications
              of reducing this time to market are staggering with regard to the positive
              impact on the cost and quality of health care to say nothing of the human lives
              that could be saved. The Lotus Notes software platform will provide the
              formulation of a user-friendly, efficient software package that will expedite
              and facilitate the task of submitting CANDAs to the FDA and the analysis of the
              data by the individual reviewers. As a first step, BIOSOFT believes that the
              power of Lotus Notes can greatly simplify the development of an electronic Case
              Report Form (CRF) for use at clinical sites, and the validation and
              certification of information. In the future, BIOSOFT believes that this
              electronic CRF will be complemented with electronic lab notebooks to create an
              extremely powerful basis for a submission to the FDA exceeding current
              standards and expectations. This approach can become the basis for
              re-engineering the drug development process, reducing the time to market by as
              much as 50 percent.
