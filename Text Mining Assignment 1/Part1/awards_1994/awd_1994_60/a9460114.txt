Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an
              efficient algorithm for approximately computing nonlinear H( control laws. The
              design of a nonlinear H( control law is reduced to solving two
              Hamilton-Jacobi-lsaacs (HJI) equations, an extension of the algebraic Ricatti
              equation. Due to their nonlinear nature, it is almost impossible to obtain the
              closed-form solution of the HJI equations. An innovative algorithm and data
              structure is proposed to find a numerical solution of the HJI equations.
              Assuming the solution of the HJI equation in the Taylor series form, this
              algorithm will obtain the coefficients of the Taylor series by iteratively
              solving an algebraic Ricatti equation and a sequence of linear algebraic
              equations. American GNC Corporation's approach is the first-ever effort for
              providing a systematic procedure to approximately solve the HJI equations. This
              procedure can be easily implemented in routine computer languages and software
              packages. Their approach may be the only feasible method for making the
              nonlinear H( control a practical design tool and can find a wide range of
              applications for controlling highly uncertain nonlinear systems such as high
              performance missile and/or aircraft systems, high accuracy robot manipulators,
              and large maneuvering spacecraft. The effectiveness of the proposed approach
              will be illustrated by a high performance missile autopilot design experiment
              in a real-time control/simulation environment.
