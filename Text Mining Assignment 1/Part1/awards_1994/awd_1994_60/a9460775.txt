Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the
              development of Pockels transverse type UV modulators from E-O materials of the
              borate family. The half-wave voltage decreases as the wavelength is decreased
              and the length is increased. It is proposed to demonstrate a UV modulator with
              a half-wave voltage of less than 1000 volts at 266nm. UV modulators are
              required for high density information storage and retrieval with high
              resolution. Quantum Technology (QT) proposes in Phase I to investigate new
              members of the borate family, namely Lead Tetraborate (PBO) and Strontium
              Tetraborate (SBO). These materials were grown for the first time by Prof. Bruce
              Chai of the University of Central Florida Center of Research and Education in
              Optics and Lasers (CREOL). These materials have the potential as UV modulators
              because of their basic properties:  (1) UV transmission down to 130nm (SBO) and
              280nm (PBO); (2) high refractive index; (3) not soluble in water; (4) growth
              characteristics of congruent melt, which enables them to be grown by
              Czochralski method; and (5) low piezo-electric resonance, typical of the borate
              family. Large crystals, 8 x 40 x 120nm3, were grown in seven days. The current
              growth process is not fully optimized. In the Phase I proposal, QT will
              investigate the electro-optic coefficients rc1 and rc2  and measure the
              parameters of PBO/SBO as a transverse E-O amplitude modulator in the UV.
