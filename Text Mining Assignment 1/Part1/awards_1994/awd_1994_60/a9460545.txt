Abstract    :
              Ion implantation can change the properties of a surface without changing the
              underlying substrate.  This technology has growing applications to wear
              reduction and corrosion reduction of metal surfaces.  Many of these
              applications have been limited by the fact that implantation is usually a `line
              of sight process`. Plasma source ion implantation (PSII) has the potential to
              overcome this limitation as long  as the plasma can be made to `conform` to the
              surface throughout the implant's duration. Limitations in plasma density and
              power system drive conditions often limit the degree to which the implant
              conforms to the surface. By increasing the plasma density and power system peak
              power, those limitations can be overcome, leading to a significant improvement
              in the uniformity of the implant and a subsequent increase in implant utility
              as a surface modification technique. By combining NSRC's expertise in high
              current pulse transformer design with improved high density plasma sources
              North Star Research Corp.,  can develop a system which overcomes the present
              limitations of PSII. In this Phase I program, the researchers will use existing
              pulsed power equipment at NSRC along with a high density plasma source to make
              an initial study of the high density, high power PSII regime.  Preliminary
              implants will be performed to validate this new technique.
