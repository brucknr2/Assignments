Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at producing
              high-value metal/metal oxide composite powders (Ag, Pd, Au, Pt) by spray
              pyrolysis. These powders are used extensively in the electronics industry for
              manufacture of circuit boards and capacitors. Current methods of powder
              synthesis cannot adequately control the size distribution of the powders, nor
              give controlled phase and elemental composition and in the case of Palladium
              give useful oxidation resistance. Nanochem Inc. proposes to develop novel
              chemical routes to form composite particles containing the metal and an
              inexpensive filler materials such as metal oxide. The proposed research will
              result in a process for the generation of metal powders with high purity,
              narrow size distribution, smaller particle size, and controlled elemental and
              phase composition at a cost less than is possible with the current
              manufacturing process. The Phase I effort will prove the feasibility of this
              approach by using currently available aerosol techniques to produce Ag, Pd, Au
              and Pt particles with vastly improved properties relative to existing
              materials. In addition, there will be a significant cost reduction associated
              with the manufacture of these composite powders due to the replacement of the
              metal with the inexpensive filler material.
