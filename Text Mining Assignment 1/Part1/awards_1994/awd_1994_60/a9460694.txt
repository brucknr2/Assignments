Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
              dynamic simulation model as applied to fuel cells, one of the most promising
              technologies for distributed generation. To facilitate high penetration into
              utility grids, fuel cell power plants are desired to be fully automated with
              remote monitoring, capable of load-following, and availabilities of more than
              95%. The distinctive feature of dynamic simulation approach to control of power
              plants is to enable the designers to test power plant's transient response to
              load variations, system upsets, and other modes of operation prior to plant
              construction. Another unique feature of dynamic simulation includes: increased
              flexibility in implementing advanced control strategies and utilizing
              state-of-the-art algorithms such as robust, fuzzy logic and neural network in
              fuel cell power plants. It will also include development of power management
              and supervisory control of such plants, leading to a highly automated
              generation system. Use of advanced control systems make it possible to improve
              the operating flexibility and enhance the life of a power plant and will ensure
              the plant's reliability during rapid load changes without stressing the key
              components of the plant. The dynamic simulation and intelligent control will
              ultimately lead to cost-cutting benefits associated with operator training,
              efficiency, availability and reliability of the fuel cell power plants.
