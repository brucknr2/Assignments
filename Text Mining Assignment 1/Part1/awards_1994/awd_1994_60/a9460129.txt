Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the
              Inductive Plasma Centrifuge (IPC) concept, a novel, high throughput approach
              for separating elements of different atomic weights. Mass based separation,
              ranging from the separation of heavy metal contaminated wastes to medical
              isotopes, is an important problem encountered in environmental remediation
              activities and in industry. A cost effective, high mass throughput separation
              method is needed. Vacuum arc centrifuges, studied for medical isotope
              separation, are limited by low mass throughput and high energy consumption,
              while gas centrifuges have limited rotation velocities and small separative
              powers. The objective of the proposed effort is to determine the feasibility of
              the IPC concept to overcome these limitations. This objective will be addressed
              in Phase I by performing three tasks: (1) design and assemble a small-scale IPC
              experiment; (2) perform preliminary feasibility experiments at pressures of up
              to 1 torr in order to demonstrate rotation frequencies of at least 105
              radians/sec, and (3) develop the conceptual design for a Phase II IPC
              laboratory prototype device. If successful, this work will form a firm basis
              for comprehensive feasibility demonstrations of the IPC concept in Phase II.
              This project is responsive to the 1994 Solicitation emphasis on National
              Critical Technologies in the areas of Materials Synthesis and Processing, and
              Pollution Minimization and Remediation.
