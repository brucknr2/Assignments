Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed at a method
              to significantly reduce the cost of fuel cells which are actively being
              developed as the power source for electric vehicles. Specifically, this program
              will demonstrate the practical application of inexpensive catalysts, containing
              little or no noble metal, as H2-oxidation catalysts in a proton-exchange
              membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The catalysts are intended to replace the costly Pt
              anode catalysts, currently used in PEMFCs. Objectives of the Phase I program
              are to demonstrate short-term stability of the catalysts, develop efficient
              electrode structures for use with these catalysts, and evaluate the tolerance
              of the catalysts to contaminants in the fuel stream. The program will culminate
              in continuous operation of a 40-cm2 active area PEMFC containing the most
              promising catalyst for a minimum of 200 hours. The development of inexpensive
              catalyst to replace the Pt-based PEMFC anode catalysts would result in a
              significant reduction in PEMFC cost, increasing the economic competitiveness of
              PEMFC-powered vehicles with vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines.
