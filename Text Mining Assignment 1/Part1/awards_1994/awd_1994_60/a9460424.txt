Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to show the
              feasibility of an advanced concept electro-optical fluorescence microscope
              suitable for both routine analysis and research applications. Fluorescence
              microscopy has become an increasingly important research and diagnostic tool in
              the life sciences and material sciences. Applying video imaging to fluorescence
              microscopy has been difficult due to the low level of fluorescent emission and
              low contrast in the image. Current video fluorescence microscopes cannot show
              real-time 1280 x 1024, images at the diffraction limit of the optics. This
              instrument has many features that are unavailable in any single fluorescence
              microscope, including real-time, multi-color video images, instantaneous zoom
              with no change in focus or brightness, selective contrast enhancement,
              fluorescence lifetime excitation, simultaneous full-color
              transmission/reflection imaging, or simultaneous transmission/fluorescence
              imaging, and diffraction-limited resolution for all objective powers. The
              technology can be expanded to include steerable zoom and stereo imaging. The
              technology promises to have a cost at the low end of current fluorescence
              methods.
