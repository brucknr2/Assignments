Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is structured to test
              and establish the technical feasibility of a novel biochemical system for the
              high efficiency removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous and organic streams
              of industrial and environmental importance. These materials are among the most
              prevalent and problematic waste treatment and environmental remediation
              targets. Current technologies, however, provide only partially effective
              treatment and are costly to implement and use. It is proposed that an enzyme,
              tyrosinase, which is an important element in natural systems for the
              transformation of phenolic compounds and which is available from a number of
              sources, be used in a controlled process for the oxidation of phenols to
              reactive intermediates. In a second process stage, naturally produced
              amine-containing polymers such as chitosan are to be developed for their
              ability to adsorb those reactive intermediates from the medium in which they
              are produced prior to their reaction with and inactivation of the tyrosinase
              catalyst. The objectives of this Phase I project are to: 1) assess the in-use
              stability of tyrosinase and devise means to enhance its stability by
              immobilization inside the adsorption polymer matrix, 2) determine the
              adsorption capacity of the polymer matrix for phenol oxidation products, and 3)
              determine whether conditions can be found to regenerate that polymer and still
              maintain tyrosinase activity and polymer integrity. It is anticipated that this
              work will identify conditions for multiple reuses of both the tyrosinase
              catalyst and bioadsorbants under practical operating conditions and thus pave
              the way for system development studies.
