Abstract    :
              Since the advent of lasers in the early 1960s and their integration into
              semiconductor substrates Weidlinger Associates, Inc.,  has seen traditional
              electronic technologies augmented by optical devices; the future will see many
              of them supplanted. These new optoelectronic devices are made possible by a
              variety of innovative concepts, materials, and designs requiring unprecedented
              technical sophistication. Monolithic integration has simplified the process
              considerably, by including waveguide routing, grating couplers, 3-D resonators,
              and diffractive optics on an IC-like substrate. Digital processor technology is
              a natural target for optical augmentation. However, as these devices mature,
              conventional experiments and analyses are approaching practical limits of
              effectiveness. Comprehensive 2-D and 3-D computer modeling using finite
              element/finite difference methods is a viable alternative. Such modeling will
              confer a competitive advantage to users and act as a catalyst for new classes
              of innovative devices. In Phase I Weidlinger Associates, Inc., will develop a
              comprehensive finite element/finite difference simulation system to solve
              Maxwell's equations in integrated optoelectronic devices. This will be based on
              their existing electromagnetic solver, EMFlex. The immediate need in Phase I
              appears to be propagation models for routed waveguides, grating couplers,
              tapers, mirrors, and diffractive optics, rather than active devices or
              nonlinear models. Their objective is to put this code in the hands of designers
              and experimentalists immediately.
