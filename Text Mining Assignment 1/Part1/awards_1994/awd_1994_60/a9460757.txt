Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project based on the concepts of
              multivariate linear inverse interpolation and physical optimality would develop
              a finite stepwise procedure which would guarantee an optimal, or near-optimal,
              design in a small number of design cycles regardless of the design model size.
              It can readily optimize the frame geometry, resulting in designs which would be
              generally lighter than the minimal weight frames of fixed geometry. In
              contrast, the existing methods for structural optimization are iterative in
              nature, and have significant limitations in regard to the design model size and
              optimality.  Phase I research would establish the feasibility of the new
              approach by developing the essential analytical details of the algorithms used
              in the innovation, along with error analysis in support of the high
              computational reliability of the approach. Phase II effort would develop
              efficient computer implementations of these algorithms, formal proofs of
              optimality, and the capability to handle dynamic loadings.  A PC-based FORTRAN
              program to optimize building frame design to meet contemporary design standards
              would also be developed. This program would be unique in its scope, since no
              structural frame design program available today offers the capability of fully
              automated optimal design.
