Abstract    :
              This SBIR Project will establish the feasibility of a neural network based
              advanced intelligent motor controller for fuel cell powered Next Generation
              Vehicles (NGV). The NGVs present control problems whose solution by
              conventional controller technology may present unacceptable technical,
              schedule, and cost risks. The neural network approach represents a
              revolutionary advancement to the field of vehicle control. The key objectives
              of this project are: to establish feasibility of a neural network based power
              control system for the NGV; to apply to 4 wheel, 4 motor vehicle configuration;
              to determine the optimal paradigm for NGV motor control; to determine optimal
              control by distributed vs. central control; to meet national goals of
              three-times fuel efficiency with marketable performance; and to plan and design
              for initial application to a bus in Phase II, then transition the controller to
              other vehicle classes in Phase III.
