Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on preparation
              of substitutes for scarce, strategically important metals. Platinum group
              metals are scarce, expensive, and have a number of desirable properties,
              resistance to chemical attack, excellent thermal stability, and excellent
              electrical conductivity. Perhaps the most useful property is the ability to
              catalyze a wide range of chemical reactions. The members of this group include
              platinum ($400/oz), ruthenium (($450/oz), rhodium ($1,200/oz), palladium
              ($400/oz), osmium ($500/oz), and iridium ($250/oz). The natural sources of
              these metals are found almost exclusively in South Africa, Russia, and Canada.
              Certainly, an inexpensive material with platinum-like properties that could be
              made from non-scarce materials would be of great value. As substitutes for
              platinum group metals, TDA proposes to produce and evaluate novel molecular
              metal carbide cluster materials. The molecular metal carbides are (MoC4)n and
              (WC4)m,, where n = 1 to 4 and m = 1 to 8. While the structures of these species
              have yet to be proven, reasonable structures have been proposed for which the
              Mo and W metal sites possess d8 electronic configuration (the same as the
              Platinum Group metals). In Phase I, TDA will produce test quantities of these
              materials, and characterize their ability to act as platinum-like catalysts for
              a variety of commercially important reactions.
