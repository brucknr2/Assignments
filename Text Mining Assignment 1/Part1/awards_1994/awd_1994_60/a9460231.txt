Abstract    :
              This award supports the research of Professor P. Aluffi to work  in algebraic
              geometry.  He will work on problems deriving from  the study of hypersurface
              singularities. He hopes to find a new  formula for MacPherson's Chern class and
              to extend results on  duality of projective varieties. He hopes to apply some
              of these  results to the study of combinatorial questions on graphs.    The
              research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of
              modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to  the point where it has, in the
              past 10 years, solved problems  that have stood for centuries. Originally, it
              treated figures  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely 
              polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra,  but also
              from analysis and topology, and conversely it is  extensively used in those
              fields.  Moreover it has proved itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics,
              theoretical computer  science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
