Abstract    :
              This proposal presents an approach to resolving a critical and enduring obstacle
              to developing dependable biosensor systems for the timely detection of toxic
              and infectious agents. This device is vital to the protection of military
              personnel and of civilians in industrial and densely populated environments.
              BSI Corporation proposes to develop a passivated sensor surface which will
              associate uniquely with the specific binding protein in its crude source
              solution and, upon activation by light, covalently bond this protein
              functionally oriented in a stabilizing, biomolecule-compatible environment A
              trifunctional amino acid will be derivatized on one site with a
              photoactivatable reagent capable upon illumination of forming covalent bonds
              with essentially any organic target group (including all proteins) under mild
              reaction conditions. This reagent will then be thermochemically bonded to a
              ligand for the specific binding protein and to the sensor surface previously
              passivated with BSI's Photolink photoreactive hydrogel, to provide an
              essentially aqueous environment containing chosen ligand and photoreactive
              groups adjacent on the sensor surface. These reagents are especially useful
              with antibodies and fusion proteins from genetic engineering technology. This
              approach thus presents an innovative combination of affinity chromatography and
              photoaffinity labeling technologies to provide a cost-effective link between
              genetic engineering products and sensor devices.
