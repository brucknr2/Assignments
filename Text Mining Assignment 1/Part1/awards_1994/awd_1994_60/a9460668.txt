Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-l project seeks to establish a
              program to demonstrate the feasibility of in vitro seaweed cell/tissue culture
              technology as a viable and effective means of producing research and
              development quantities of the high-value anticancer natural product halomon.
              Halomon is a powerful cytotoxic natural product compound exhibiting a unique
              specificity for, and high activity against certain highly chemoresistant human
              tumor cell lines. The compound is not amenable to artificial synthesis in
              adequate quantities to support drug development.  Furthermore, the only known
              source is a limited population of the marine alga Portieria hornemannii from a
              remote island in the Philippines. Preclinical development of the compound is
              currently hampered by lack of raw material. This proposal details a program for
              developing an alternative to wild collections by bringing the alga into
              cell/tissue culture. The methods to be used are based on techniques and
              technologies for in vitro culture of marine macrophytes and terrestrial plants,
              as well as plant biotechnology. Phase l will develop the basic culture
              protocols for in vitro maintenance of P. hornemannii, as well as test
              physiological induction mechanisms for stimulating secondary metabolite
              production. In addition, we seek to perform preliminary experiments on
              two-phase culture which will significantly guide the planning of an optimized
              bioreactor production system to be designed and built in Phase ll.
