Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
              innovative fault-tree-based methodology for dependability analysis of complex
              computer-based systems. The innovativeness of this approach stems from
              consideration of multiple failure modes, incorporation of human and
              environmental influences, adaptation of new techniques from circuit analysis,
              and using divide and conquer techniques for evaluation of large models. The
              Phase I objective is to develop an enhanced methodology for dependability
              analysis of complex computer-based systems. The Phase II objectives are to
              fully develop and implement a commercializable dependability analysis tool that
              incorporates the techniques and methods devised in Phase I. The anticipated
              result of the Phase I effort is the feasibility demonstration indicating that
              the new methodology will significantly enhance dependability analysis of
              complex computer-based systems. The benefits include increased effectiveness in
              this analysis and the potential for more dependable, reliable, and safe
              systems.
