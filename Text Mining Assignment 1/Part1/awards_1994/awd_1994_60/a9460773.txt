Abstract    :
                Single cell cytology by flow cytometry has many applications from blood cell
              analysis to cancer diagnosis.  However, the ability to make multiple
              measurements per cell can be limited by the brief analysis times available in
              flow cytometry.  Rare populations with small cell number are also difficult to
              analyze.  We propose to demonstrate the use of quadrupole traps for single cell
              analysis and manipulation.  These electrodynamic traps can hold a cell for an
              infinite time and have the potential to enable high-resolution,
              high-sensitivity fluorescence measurements of several cell parameters
              concurrently.  The trap technique is also compatible with studies of small
              quantities (100's) of cells.  We will demonstrate several cytological
              measurement techniques in the trap.  This will illustrate the possible
              complementary of quadrupole trap analyses with flow cytometry approaches for
              cell analysis and manipulation.
