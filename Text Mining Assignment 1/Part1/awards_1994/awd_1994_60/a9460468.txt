Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves the development
              of a supersonic nozzle beam source of  'active nitrogen' to be used in the
              molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of nitride materials. The approach involves
              'seeding' a heavy (and relatively inert) nitrogen precursor gas in a light
              carrier gas and using supersonic expansion to accelerate the precursor
              molecules towards the substrate surface with an energy sufficient to cause bond
              dissociation. The resultant species would be a free radical and thus, highly
              reactive. Further variation of the translational kinetic energy of the nitrogen
              precursor species by use of different seeding gases will enhance the mobility
              of the metal and N species necessary to produce Group III nitride
              monocrystalline thin films with limited defects. This project represents a
              joint effort of Aerodyne Research, Inc. in collaboration with the Material
              Science and Engineering Department at North Carolina State University.
