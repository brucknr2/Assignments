Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed at
              determining the feasibility of a new enzymatic process for synthesizing insect
              pheromones. Pheromones are nontoxic, naturally occurring chemicals that show
              great promise in controlling insect pests in agriculture. However, there
              currently is no cost advantage to using pheromones, primarily because
              pheromones are expensive chemicals. In the Phase I program, unsaturated fatty
              acids with specific location of a single double bond (which are key, high-value
              intermediates in numerous pheromones) will be synthesized from inexpensive
              saturated fatty acids. The proposed new enzymatic-synthesis process is based on
              enzymes that insects themselves use to produce pheromones. If successful, this
              process should result in production of pheromones at a cost two to four times
              less than is the case with traditional chemical synthesis. Researchers believe
              that this could substantially increase the use of pheromones in agriculture and
              also result in significant environmental benefits from both synthesis and use
              of pheromones compared with insecticides. Success in the Phase I program will
              lead to process development and scale-up in Phase II and commercialization in
              Phase III.
