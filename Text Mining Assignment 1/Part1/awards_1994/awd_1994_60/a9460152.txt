Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a design
              and prototype for innovative CD-ROM educational materials entitled Beginning
              Explorations in Social Science (BESS) aimed at introducing social science
              contributions, elementary statistics, and data analysis to high school juniors
              and seniors and to college freshman students. Adults who desire to develop or
              rediscover elementary data analysis and interpretation skills will likewise be
              able to profit from using the materials. Social science data sets have grown
              exponentially in size, number, and quality over the last ten years. However,
              easy access to these data sets by social scientists has lagged considerably, so
              that much of the data's potential for informing science, policy, and practice
              has not been met. Sociometrics Corporation has pioneered in making this wealth
              of data resources readily available, easy to use, and widely disseminated
              through the establishment of indexed data archives in a number of important
              health and social science areas. The proposed project will complement these
              ongoing corporate efforts with new work focused on enlarging and training the
              potential user base for such data by combining important research findings with
              state of-the-art social science data in the Sociometrics archives and
              state-of-the-art multimedia computer technology.
