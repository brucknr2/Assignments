Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a method
              for detecting nitrogen  dioxide (NO2), one of the most important components of
              nitrogen oxide species (NOy) in the  troposphere. Direct measurements of NO2 
              are crucial for understanding the chemical processes that  determine natural
              levels of tropospheric ozone and for assessing potential effects of
              human-influenced  emissions. The difficulties associated with direct
              measurements of  NO2 in the unpolluted troposphere  arise from low ((100 pptv)
              concentrations and the potential for interferences from other more abundant 
              nitrogen compounds. This proposal would develop a direct spectroscopic method
              using infrared  absorption with a tunable diode laser light source which would
              directly detect absolute levels of NO2  in the clean troposphere. A key
              component of the proposed research plan is the development of a long  path
              length, low volume absorption cell which would have sufficient length ( 600 M)
              to provide adequate sensitivity and yet have a minimal volume ((10 liters) to
              enable rapid sampling and a minimal instrument response time.  Modulation of
              the trace species at the cell inlet would allow real-time background
              subtraction to further increase the sensitivity.  Automated signal processing
              using curve fitting to known spectral line parameters would provide absolute
              concentration levels without using calibration gasses.  The resulting
              instrument would have an NO2 detection limit of 4 ppt with a signal averaging
              time of 100 s.
