Abstract    :
              The work proposed here will result in the development of a new type of infrared
              detector utilizing very recent developments in microcantilevers.
              Microcantilevers that are 50-200 (m long, 10-40 (m wide, and 0.3-3 (m thick are
              commonly used in scanning force microscopy (SFM) to detect forces in the range
              of 10-12- 10-9 N. Such devices can be mass produced using micromachining. Using
              the bimetallic effect and geometrical optimization, cantilevers can be designed
              that are capable of measuring temperature changes as small as 10-8 K.
              Cantilever deflections less than a few tenths of a nanometer can be accurately
              measured using optical, piezoresistive, or capacitive techniques. For infrared
              detection, these microcantilevers can be coated with infrared absorbing
              materials. An array of these microcantilevers with specific coatings can be
              used to detect and characterize a wide range of radiation. Reference
              microcantilevers can also be used to compensate for temperature fluctuations in
              sensor devices. If a stress- or thermally-responsive coating is used then
              deflections can also be measured as changes in resonance frequency. The
              objective is to develop an infrared detector that is sensitive, miniature, and
              can be mass produced. The proposed work would provide a highly significant
              advance in detector technology with implications in many areas.
