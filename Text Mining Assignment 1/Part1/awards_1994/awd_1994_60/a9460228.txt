Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the critical
              substrate issue in the development of ZnSSe blue-green LEDs and Lasers.
              Recently, there has been much interest in the research and development of
              blue-green LEDs and laser diodes due to the tremendous market potential for
              their applications in displays, electronics, communications and information
              storage. Among all the semiconductors, ZnSe based semiconductors are one of the
              prime candidates for the fabrication of blue-green lasers. Although ZnSe based
              LEDs and laser diodes have recently been produced, their lifetime has been a
              critical issue. One of the major causes of the insufficient lifetime is the
              lack of device quality ZnSe substrates. After analyzing past and current ZnSe
              crystal growth techniques and II-V1 semiconductor compound defect chemistry,
              Fermionics Corporation  proposes an innovative method to grow ZnSe crystals at
              low temperatures. They plan to not only grow ZnSe single crystals, but also
              produce crystals with the lowest crystalline defects. In addition, they will
              study the feasibility of producing high conductivity p-type ZnSe by in situ
              impurity doping. In Phase I, the feasibility of growing high quality ZnSe
              single crystal will be demonstrated. In Phase II, large ZnSe crystals will be
              produced, and ZnSSe LEDs and laser diodes will be fabricated. Finally, in Phase
              III, these products will be commercialized.
