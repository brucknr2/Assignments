Abstract    :
              Silane is a toxic, pyrophoric gas which is used in large quantities (>150,000
              lbs/yr) by the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Advanced Technology
              Materials (ATMI) is a world leader in the development of scrubbers, purifiers,
              and delivery systems for hazardous gases. In the proposed Phase I program ATMI
              will work with the University of Wisconsin to determine the feasibility of
              generating silane in a point-of-use fashion from nonhazardous precursors. The
              precursors are specifically designed to allow both generation of high purity
              silane and recycling of the chemical byproducts. The availability of a silane
              generation system would represent a major enhancement to the environmental
              safety and health of semiconductor fabrication facilities and the communities
              in which they are located.  In the Phase II program ATMI will develop large
              scale synthetic procedures for the precursors and will build a prototype
              generator which will be used to grow high purity silicon. This will lead to
              commercial introduction of the system in Phase III.
