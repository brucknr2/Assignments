Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops NbTi
              superconductors with artificial pinning centers with an optimal composition in
              terms of performance and cost.  Supercon has developed a patented and proven
              process for the manufacture of NbTi superconductors using an artificial pinning
              center approach (APC), which assembles alternate layers of Nb and Ti metals to
              form a superconducting filament through partial diffusion of the pure metals.
              It allows one to have independent control of the filament effective composition
              as well as both the non-superconducting phase (pinning center) thickness and
              spacing. Conventional NbTi composite manufacturing uses- Nb-47 wt. % Ti for
              most applications. In principle, the Supercon APC approach can fabricate
              composites with filaments of almost any effective overall composition. The
              proximity effect is thought to limit practical NbTi alloy compositions with
              industrially useful Tc and Hc2 to within the range of 40 to 65 wt. % Ti. Most
              APC conductors reported in the literature have an overall composition on the Nb
              rich side of this range. As a result, the Hc2 is reduced, and the cost of the
              raw materials is increased over a conventional alloy. This proposed work builds
              upon existing APC manufacture experience at Supercon to optimize new composites
              with different filament compositions suitable for specific applied magnetic
              filed ranges, while minimizing the Nb content and therefore cost in each case.
              The technical objective of the Phase I effort is to understand how
              independently varying both the composition (relative Nb and Ti layer thickness)
              and the second phase volume fraction (thermal processing conditions) effect the
              microstructural, mechanical, and electrical properties (Jc and Hc2) of APC NbTi
              superconducting composites.
