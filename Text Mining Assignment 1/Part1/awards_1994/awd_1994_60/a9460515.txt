Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes a novel
              processing route to develop an improved, thermal shock resistant, high strength
              glass-ceramic composed essentially of pollucite (CsAlSi2O6) crystals.
              Crystalline pollucite has excellent refractoriness (melts above 1900ÝC), a low
              coefficient of thermal expansion, high mechanical strength and good chemical
              durability. Previous attempts to prepare essentially pollucite-based
              glass-ceramics have been largely unsuccessful due to high melting temperatures,
              significant volatilization of cesium at temperatures above 1800ÝC, and the
              unavailability of a suitable container to hold these high temperature melts. A
              nonconventional method, which uses pollucite glass microspheres (beads) as
              precursors, followed by hot-pressing and crystallization, will be used to
              fabricate glass-ceramics in the present investigation. The precursor glass
              beads will be prepared by a flame spraying method (>2500ÝC), which avoids the
              volatilization of cesium that occurred in all previous attempts to make
              pollucite glass-ceramics. A few selected properties which establish the
              suitability of a material for practical use, such as the thermal expansion
              coefficient, chemical durability, and flexural strength will also be measured
              for these glass-ceramics.
