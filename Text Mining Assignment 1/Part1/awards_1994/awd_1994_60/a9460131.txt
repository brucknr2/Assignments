Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address a major
              problem for environmental restoration: the low cost measurement of soil
              contaminants and their transport characteristics. First Point Scientific, Inc.
              proposes to develop a novel Neutron/X-ray Spectral (NXS) logging instrument,
              which will be used with a cone penetrometer (a probe which is hydraulically
              driven into the ground), for this purpose. This instrument uses passive and
              neutron-induced gamma-ray spectroscopy and x-ray spectroscopy techniques to
              make the needed measurements. It is expected to provide high sensitivity (e.g.,
              Hg @ 0.2-2 ppm; Cl @ 3-20 ppm), for both detection and monitoring activities,
              without the use of radioactive materials. It will also provide attractive
              sampling volumes and depth resolution. The objective of the proposed project is
              to determine the technical feasibility of the NXS concept. This will be
              accomplished by performing two tasks: (1) develop the preliminary design for a
              laboratory prototype NXS instrument and (2) evaluate its performance, in terms
              of minimum detection levels, through detailed computer modeling. Los Alamos
              National Laboratory, Westinghouse Hanford Co., and Cornell University personnel
              will contribute to these tasks. Successful demonstrations of feasibility in
              Phase I will provide a firm foundation for construction and testing of the
              laboratory prototype instrument in Phase II. This project responds to the 1994
              Solicitation emphasis on National Critical Technologies in the area of
              Pollution Minimization and Remediation.
