Abstract    :
              9411702  Schemske       Invasions of exotic plant species represent a major
              concern of  those charged with maintaining and protecting native communities.  
              Particular exotics have produced major ecological perturbations,  and in some
              areas the sheer numbers of introduced plant species  swamp out native floras. 
              Once an exotic pest becomes established  in an area, ecologists and resource
              managers would like to know  where it is likely to spread and when it will get
              there.  The  factors influencing rates of invasion are important objects of 
              study both to  understand the dynamics of range expansion in  general and to
              begin to address urgent questions of exotics  management and control.       The
              proposed research focusses on Cytisus scoparius (Scotch  broom), a serious pest
              plant on the West Coast of North America.   Observational and experimental
              approaches will characterize the  seed dispersal distribution of this plant as
              contributed by the  explosive opening of fruits and by secondary ant dispersal.
               The  population consequences of relatively long-distance jumps will be 
              evaluated in a whole field experiment manipulating the distribution  of adult
              plants.
