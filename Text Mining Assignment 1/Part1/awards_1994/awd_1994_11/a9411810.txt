Abstract    :
              9411810  Wang  Research equipment grant funds are used in this project for 
              acquisition of computer and automation equipment to support  collaborative
              research between the Robotics and Automation  Laboratory and Advanced Mining
              Systems Laboratory. Specific  research projects include automated robotic
              excavation using  fuzzy logic and neural networks; automated rock drill 
              operation using adaptive force feedback control; and  mechatronic design of
              high performance robot arms. The  equipment is utilized to conduct
              cross-disciplinary  experimental work, test innovative ideas and concepts in 
              advanced robotic research, and develop hands-on expertise in  robotic
              applications.  ***
