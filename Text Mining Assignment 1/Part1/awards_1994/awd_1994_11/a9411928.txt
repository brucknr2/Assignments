Abstract    :
              9411928  Shanks  This equipment is to be used for research to maximize the 
              production of pharmaceutical compounds from genetically-  transformed "hairy
              root" plant cultures of Catharanthus roseus.   The HPLC photodiode array will
              be used to identify and quantitate  alkaloids obtained from C. roseus.  This
              equipment will also be  used to fingerprint the specific composition of a
              recombinant  protein obtained from a genetically engineered Escherichia coli.
