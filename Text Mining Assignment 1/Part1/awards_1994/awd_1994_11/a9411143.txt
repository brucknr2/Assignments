Abstract    :
              9411143  Veas  Coastal Carolina University  The photochromism of
              1,3,5-triphenylformazan (TPF) (or a-Phenylazo-a-phenylhydrazonotoluene) and its
              derivatives will be studied in solution and the feasibility of the use of this
              compound to determine structural characteristics of polymers will be explored.
              UV/Visible and infrared spectra of TPF will be complemented with calculations
              to understand the photochromism process. Synthetic methods to incorporate
              photochromic TPF derivatives into polymers will be explored as well.     This
              grant from the Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Nina Veas
              at Coastal Carolina University in the form of a Research Planning Grant. A
              molecules that changes color upon irradiation with ultraviolet light will be
              studied to determine the mechanism of this process, which is called
              photochromism. Computational methods will be employed as an aid in the
              determination of the mechanism of photochromism. This molecule and its
              derivatives will also be used to determine the structure of polymers by means
              of photochromism.
