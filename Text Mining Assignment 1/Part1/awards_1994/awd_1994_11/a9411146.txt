Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for the acquisition of a state-of-art  ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)
              sputter deposition system for the  preparation of nanostructured metal films.
              The system is  equipped with two magnetron sputtering sources, two ion beam 
              sources (one for deposition and one for simultaneous ion-  beam modification of
              the microstructure), capabilities for  substrate heating and biasing, two gas
              supplies (argon for  sputtering, and oxygen or nitrogen), residual gas
              analyzer,  two crystal rate monitors for thickness measurement, and  computer
              process control. The combination of the UHV sputter  deposition system with the
              world-class analytical electron  microscopy facilities at the University will
              provide a  unique opportunity to investigate and manipulate the  composition
              and microstructure of metal films on the  nanometer scale. With this system,
              metal films can be  fabricated that have different composition and impurity 
              content and different microstructure. The control of  microstructure,
              composition and impurity content is  important in on-going research addressing:
              1) examination of  the role of grain structure and grain boundary diffusion in 
              multilayer thin films, 2) studies of the mechanism of  segregation of chromium
              to grain boundaries of cobalt-alloy  films, the effect of impurities (such as
              oxygen) on this  segregation, and the role that this segregation plays in the 
              magnetic noise characteristics of cobalt-alloy thin film  storage media (in
              collaboration with IBM for magnetic  storage applications), and 3) fundamental
              studies of  interparticulate and interphase magnetic exchange coupling  in
              nanoheterogeneous thin films (in collaboration with  Brookhaven National
              Laboratory and General Motors R&D for  energy applications). The sputter
              deposition system also  will be useful in the education of graduate and 
              undergraduate students in thin film materials processing.
