Abstract    :
              9411756  Vikram    This is a SGER proposal submitted in the Ceramic Program. 
              The PI  aims to introduce a fundamentally new optical approach to measure 
              ultralow thermal expansion coefficients of irregular shapes and  sizes of
              samples.  The method is self calibrating and has not been  tested before.  The
              scattered light from the sample (where I =  intensity of light, A = area of the
              sample, l = linear dimension of  the sample) will be used as an approach to
              measure precisely the  thermal expansion coefficient.  This is a preliminary
              work on a  untested, novel and fundamentally sound idea.    %%%%    The
              proposed work aims to introduce a new approach for measuring  thermal expansion
              coefficients of irregular shaped bodies by using  a new untested optical
              method.  The technique is self-calibrating  and has potential in the area of
              high temperature structural  ceramics, engine components etc.  ***
