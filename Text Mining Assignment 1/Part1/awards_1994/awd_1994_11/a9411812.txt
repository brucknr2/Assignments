Abstract    :
              9411812  Srienc  This equipment is to be used for several research projects, 
              including: (1) quantitation of protein secretion in single  Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae cells; and (2) quantitation of protein  in single mammalian cells
              such as hybridomas.  This equipment  will provide a unique way for experimental
              verification of data  suggested from population models.  It will also provide a
              means  of isolating cells with increased ability to secrete different 
              metabolites.  ***
