Abstract    :
              9411144  Komanduri    This award supports cooperative research between Ranga
              Komanduri,  Oklahoma State University, and Hou Zhenbin, Tongji University 
              Shanghai, China.  The proposal is for cooperative research on  thermal aspects
              of manufacturing processes and materials.  A  variety of manufacturing
              technologies such as low-pressure CVD  diamond coating techniques, magnetic
              field assisted polishing of  advanced ceramics, laser assisted machining of
              materials, and  conventional machining of superalloys will be considered. 
              Advanced  materials considered include diamond, ceramics, glasses, and 
              composites.  Initiation of investigation on some of these processes  is
              proposed, with the expectation that collaborative work would  continue beyond
              the duration of the award.  This award supported  under the U.S.-China
              Cooperative Research Program.
