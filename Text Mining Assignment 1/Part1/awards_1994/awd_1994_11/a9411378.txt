Abstract    :
              9411378  Narin  The proposed research will examine the relationship between 
              patented US technology and US science through an analysis of  references cited
              on US patent grants in 1987/88 and in  1992/93.  Hypothesis testing will be
              used to determine if  the preference for citing US references on US-inventor 
              patents is increasing, whether a significant amount of the  citation pertains
              to very fundamental research, the source  of the research funding, for example
              from NSF and NIH,  whether citations are concentrated in specific science 
              dependent technologies, how rapidly science linked  technologies are growing,
              and whether there is a geographic  dependent preference in the citations.  ***
