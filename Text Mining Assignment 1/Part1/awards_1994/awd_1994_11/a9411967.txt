Abstract    :
              9411967  Jacobs    Science can make great progress when the knowledge acquired 
              within one discipline is organized and made accessible for  detailed analysis. 
              Just as molecular genetics has made  great strides since the introduction of
              electronic databases  cataloguing the sequences of genes from animals used in 
              research, neuroscience would be advanced if appropriate  databases were made
              available to researchers.  In this  proposal, Dr. Gwen Jacobs outlined a series
              of workshops in  which neurobiologists and information scientists will gather 
              to determine how to institute electronic databases of  individually
              identifiable nerve cells.  Databases for  several different research organisms
              are now possible, and  might include detailed structural, physiological, 
              neurochemical, and genetic information about each cell.  The  databases would
              advance studies of  brain cell function, or  the behavior of neural networks. 
              This electronically stored  information could be made available over internet
              to aid  both researchers and educators.  ***
