Abstract    :
              Mr. Carl-Henry Geschwind, working under the direction of Dr. Sharon  Kingsland,
              is examining the emergence of seismology as a powerful  scientific tool for
              controlling the threats posed by earthquakes to  modern civilization.  In
              treating the history of American  seismology during its formative period
              (1880-1935), Mr. Geschwind  is focusing on three broad topics:  the
              interactions between those  seismologists primarily interested in protecting
              the public from  earthquakes and those more interested in studying earthquakes
              for  purely scientific purposes; the relative importance of natural  events,
              scientific developments and broader cultural changes in  bringing about the
              gradual emergence and popular acceptance of  seismology; and the overall place
              of seismology within larger  political and cultural trends on both the local
              and the national  level.  This dissertation promises to be of interest not only
              to  environmental historians and historians of science, but also to 
              geologists, environmental scientists, and science policy makers  seeking to
              enhance the social relevance of science.
