Abstract    :
              9411768  Berenstein       This award provides partial support for young
              investigators  to participate in the 1994 International Conference of the 
              IEEE-EBMS to be held in Baltimore, November 1994. The specific  purpose of the
              funding is directed at research developments  presented at a concurrent
              workshop whose focus is Wavelets in  Biomedical Engineering and Medicine.  This
              is a new area of  application of the wavelet theory which has the potential for
               important applications to neurophysiology, speech analysis, MRI,  spectroscopy
              and the analysis of EEG and ECG.   The workshop will  have two parts, (1)
              tutorial presentations by prominent experts  in the field and (2) a series of
              contributed talks focusing on  new developments and applications in biology and
              medicine.       The workshop focuses exclusively on developments 
              andapplications of wavelet theory to mathematical problems  arising in biology
              and medicine and does not involve any research  which could be considered to be
              directly related to medical or  health issues.  ***
