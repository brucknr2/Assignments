Abstract    :
              9411519  K. Williams    This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant affords
              the  Principal Investigator the opportunity to plan a project looking  at
              legislative decision making within the Congressional Black  Caucus and the
              Women's Caucus.  Employing a principal-agent  framework the Principal
              Investigator will develop a project  looking at the relationship between
              caucuses and interest groups.   The objective is to establish a way of
              assessing how effective  caucuses are in passing legislation which has been
              drafted by  associate interest groups.
