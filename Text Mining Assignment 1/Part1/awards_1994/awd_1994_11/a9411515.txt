Abstract    :
              9411515  HEINZ  During the last two decades, extensive changes have taken place
              in  the legal services industry.  In particular, the market for legal  services
              has changed significantly.  U.S. Supreme Court decisions  striking down
              limitations on advertising and fee schedules  unleashed new forms of
              competition and new mechanisms for the  delivery of legal services, including
              franchise law firms and group  legal service plans.  Corporate law firms
              experienced dramatic  growth, internal bureaucratization, and intense
              competition as  longstanding client relationships gave way to a transactions- 
              oriented market.  During these same decades, women entered the  professions of
              the law in far greater numbers than ever before, and  the percentage of
              minorities among legal professionals also  increased substantially, though far
              less rapidly.  These  practitioners control access to the legal system  -  in
              fact, they  dispose of most of the cases.  Therefore, the social backgrounds 
              from which they are recruited, the types of work they do, the kinds  of clients
              they represent, the professional and community roles  they occupy, and the
              social and political values they hold are  related fundamentally to the
              character of justice in American  society.    This study will be based on
              interviews with the full range of legal  professionals, including prosecutors,
              judges, and inside corporate  counsel, as well as private practitioners.  Data
              exist from a  similar survey conducted in Chicago in 1974-75, which will
              provide  a basis for comparison and analysis of the extent of changes over  the
              past twenty years.  Personal interviews will now be conducted  in Chicago with
              a random sample of about 800 respondents.  The  analyses will assess changes in
              the nature of the work, work  settings, career histories, professional
              commitment, client  relationships, professional networks, and personal
              background  characteristics.  Special attention will be given to the changing 
              roles of women and minorities in the legal services  industry.    ***
