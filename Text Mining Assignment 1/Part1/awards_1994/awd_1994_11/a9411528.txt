Abstract    :
              9411528  Cheng  As one element of the US/China (PRC) Protocol Annex III Program,
               a US-PRC Symposium on Post-Earthquake Reconstruction will be held  in April
              1995 in Kunming, PRC.Objectives of the  symposium/workshop are: 1) to discuss
              the lessons learned from  recent seismic disasters in both countries; 2) to
              assess the  current state of knowledge and practice in urban rebuilding after 
              earthquake s and to identify frontal joint research opportunities  necessary to
              advance the current state of knowledge; 3) to  stimulate future cooperative
              results of PRC's post-earthquake  reconstruction program and their practical
              implications in the  US; and 5) to continue to build the long-term bilateral 
              scientific relationship existing between academic and practicing  communities.
              Engineers, Social Scientists, Planners, Construction  Professionals and Policy
              Makers will all be involved. In March of  1993, a delegation from the
              Earthquake Resistance Office.  Ministry of Construction (MOC), PRC, visited NSF
              in Washington,  DC. This proposed symposium/workshop is approved as a high- 
              priority activity endorsed by both agencies. This is a US-China  cooperative
              earthquake engineering research project.  ***
