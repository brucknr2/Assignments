Abstract    :
              9411846  Yalamanchili  The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the
              School of Aerospace Engineering, the College of Computing and the School of
              Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology will purchase a
              cluster of multiprocessor and uniprocessor graphics workstations interconnected
              by state of the art high speed communications networks to existing parallel
              supercomputers.  This tested will provide a feasible hardware basis to pursue
              the development and application of new computational paradigms for large scale
              engineering applications.  In particular, we foresee the ability to harness
              such high speed networks of specialized graphics and parallel machines such
              that components of applications can utilize distinct parallel machines while
              results from these distinct platforms can be visualized, integrated and
              manipulated in real-time on workstations.  This integration opens new avenues
              for solutions to solving many large problem.  The research projects that will
              be the primarily users of the equipment are drawn from the development of large
              scale engineering applications, and the technology to realize an integrated,
              interactive for engineering applications.
