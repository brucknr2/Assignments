Abstract    :
              9411871  Lang  This research project will result in a documented analysis of the
               history of telecommunication and the Deaf community, with  particular emphasis
              on the invention of the telephone coupler.   This invention has had significant
              impact on the quality of living  conditions for deaf and hard-of-hearing
              people.  Developed nearly  a century after Alexander Graham Bell's invention,
              this form of  technology expanded employment opportunities and developed 
              independence for deaf members of society.  One of the objectives of  the study
              is to describe the historical struggle of deaf and hard  of hearing people to
              gain access to the telephone, culminating in  the development of the acoustic
              coupler in the 1960s and the  subsequent collaboration in the 1970s of
              organizations serving deaf  people and major telephone corporations to bring
              the technology  into the homes and businesses of deaf people.  The research 
              involves an exhaustive review of archival records and extensive  correspondence
              and inquiry among those who pioneered the  development and spread of use of the
              telephone-teletypewriter units  which preceded the more recent electronic
              devices.  Information  will also be collected from major telecommunications
              corporations  that played important roles, especially Western Union and
              American  Telephone and Telegraph companies.  Results will be published in a 
              manner of interest to historians of science, the Deaf community,  and general
              readers who wish to learn about the positive  applications of science and
              technology to enhancing people's lives.  ***
