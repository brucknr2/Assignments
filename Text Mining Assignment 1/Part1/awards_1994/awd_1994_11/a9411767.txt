Abstract    :
              9411767  Snow       Due to their severity, tornadoes have been the subject of
              much  study.  One data source, however, that is still relatively  unexplored is
              that of the location of debris lofted by the tornado  and parent storm.  The
              phenomena of lofting, deposition, transport  and fallout of debris are not well
              understood with most data being  anecdotal in nature.         The Principal
              Investigator will carry out his research under  the umbrella of the
              Verification of Origins of Rotation in  Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX) that will
              be conducted in 1994 by a  consortium of university and National Oceanic and
              Atmospheric  Administration researchers.  The Principal Investigator will 
              conduct field surveys, and telephone and mail campaigns of regions  where
              deposition and fallout are deemed likely.  He will use these  data in
              combination with supporting meteorological data collected  in VORTEX to fine
              tune a debris trajectory model and to develop  data sets for later use in
              evaluating the ability of  cloud/mesoscale models to replicate the observed
              patterns of  fallout.  He will use the observed deposition and fallout patterns
               together with observations of the tornadoes to infer the likely  mechanism
              that control lofting.       Results of this research will extend understanding
              of  tornadoes and their damage producing mechanisms, elucidate  connections
              between tornadoes and their parent thunderstorms and  further reveal the
              interaction between a thunderstorm and the  environmental winds.       Because
              of the potential hazard posed by lofting and  subsequent deposition and fallout
              of contaminated or toxic  materials, the results will be of interest to
              emergency management  personnel as well as to the meteorological community.
