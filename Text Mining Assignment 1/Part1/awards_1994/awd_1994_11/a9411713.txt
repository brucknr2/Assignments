Abstract    :
              9411713  Botez  The Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of 
              Wisconsin, Madison, will purchase high resolution spectral- and  laser
              near-field measurement equipment, which will be dedicated to  research.  The
              equipment will be used for several research projects  including in particular
              the development of high-power, single-  frequency phase-locked diode-laser
              arrays.    Phase-locked diode-laser arrays have demonstrated high diffraction- 
              limited powers:  1-1.5W.  However, the devices do not have a  single-frequency
              output, which prevents their use in many  applications.  Furthermore, at the
              present time, their number of  elements is limited to 20, which in turn limits
              the amount of  coherent power.    The proposed research consists of developing
              phase-locked  antiguided arrays with distributed feedback as well as
              implementing  novel concepts for creating 40-80-element single-spatial-mode 
              arrays.  The goals are:  single-frequency, diffraction-limited-beam  operation
              to 1W with linewidths 50kHz, and spatially coherent  powers of 3W.    The
              requested funds are for purchasing a high-resolution grating  spectrometer with
              a CCD camera as well as a vibrating mirror for  spectral near-field imaging of
              array modes.  This will enable the  study of the modal structure of novel
              devices as well as  optimization for high-power single-mode operation.  ***
