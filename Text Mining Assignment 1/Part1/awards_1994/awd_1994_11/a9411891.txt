Abstract    :
              9411891  Hsu  This project is to improve the performance of the universal  panel
              tester at the University of Houston by adding a data  management system
              including signal conditioner, storage  channels, computer and necessary
              computer software. This  will allow the universal panel tester to use the load-
               control in the load increasing phase and strain-control  technique during the
              load decreasing phase and switch from  phase to another during a test.    This
              is an equipment grant.  ***
