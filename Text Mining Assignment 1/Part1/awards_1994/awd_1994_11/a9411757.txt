Abstract    :
              9411757  Economy    This proposal is for research on exploring the fabrication
              and  mechanical properties of Carbon/Boron Nitride (C/BN).  The proposed  work
              focusses on:  a)  nature of the liquid crystalline state of  borazine
              oligomers, b) simplified process of borazine oligomers for  advanced
              composites, c) nature of C/BN interface, and d) new  methodology for preparing
              borazine.  The composites may have better  mechanical properties and the
              improved oxidation resistance  temperature up to 850C. The proposed research
              will explore method  to prepare borazine with a cost effective procedure.   
              %%%%    Light weight and of better mechanical and oxidation resistance 
              temperature composites of Carbon/Boron Nitride will be developed  and evaluated
              in the proposed work.  Such composites, if produced  successfully, will be
              useful in electronic industry and have  potential use in light weight
              components for high temperature/  mechanical applications.  ***
