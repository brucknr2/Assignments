Abstract    :
              9411732  Webster       The award is for the purchase of a high frequency data 
              acquisition system to investigate in-process grinding damage  assessment
              techniques using acoustic emission.  Preliminary results  have indicated that
              use of filtered signals is not adequate and  that the full range of data
              generated by the acoustic emission  signal must be used for effective
              assessment.  The research enabled  by the acquisition of the equipment
              requested will investigate  innovative methodologies to identify signatures
              associated with  workpiece burn and subsurface damage in conventional and
              creep-feed  grinding of ceramics and steels.       Detection of damage due to
              grinding is important since it is  usually the final process to be carried out
              on a precision  component.  Greater control of grinding damage, by improved 
              diagnostic procedures such as those sought here, is therefore of  direct
              interest to all grinding-dependent industries as it would  lead to lower scrap
              rates and cost savings.
