Abstract    :
                9411483  Smid    This U.S.-Bulgaria Joint Cooperative Research project on 
              "Associative Star Polymers of Poly(ethylene oxide)" is a renewal  of a grant
              between the research group of Dr. Johannes Smid of the  SUNY College of
              Environmental Science & Forestry and that of Dr.  Christo Tsventanov of the
              Institute of Polymers of the Bulgarian  Academy of Sciences.  The project deals
              with the synthesis,  properties and utilization of materials related to
              poly(ethylene  oxide), a polymer manufactured in both Bulgaria and the United 
              States.  Specifically, the work to be performed at the SUNY-  Syracuse campus
              would involve associative star polymers with  poly(ethylene oxide) arms
              end-capped with a hydrophobic moiety.   Such star polymers, presently being
              investigated in our  laboratory, cause phase separation when added to water,
              with  formation of a polymer rich gel phase.  This phase has a high  capacity
              and affinity for hydrophobic organic solutes.  The  project aims to synthesize
              and characterize new associative  amphophilic star polymers with PEO arms, to
              find the factors that  govern the phase separation in water and that control
              the  transfer of organic solutes to the gel phase, and to explore  methods to
              recover the star polymers after extracting the organic  solutes from water.    
                 This proposed research in theoretical physics fulfills the  program
              objectives of advancing science by enabling leading  experts in the U.S. and
              Bulgaria to combine complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas
              of strong mutual interest  and competence.  ***
