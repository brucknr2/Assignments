Abstract    :
              ***  9411850  MANCUSO  SBIR Phase-II funds are provided to investigators at
              Advanced Microscopy Techniques to develop an energy filter for electron
              backscatting patterns (EBSP) with fine pattern resolution and a large
              acceptance angel.  The Phase-II research objectives are: 1) to develop an
              energy filter and EBSP sensor element that retains high quality
              micro-diffraction patterns with improved contract due to energy filtering, and
              2) maintain a large acceptance angel for the microdiffraction patterns.  If
              these improvements can be made, two major advances would be possible.  First,
              the visibility of the diffraction pattern would improve for both direct viewing
              and for digital acquisition and analysis.  This would extend EBSP ( and
              consequently SEM) to a greater variety of applications and materials.  Second,
              the new device could serve a dual purpose as both an EBXP detector and a small
              angle (dark field) detector.  Thus, both quantitative analysis of diffraction
              patterns and qualitative diffraction imaging are available to the materials
              researcher.  The success of this research will lead to a Phase-III program to
              develop a system that can be used in basic research, materials design and
              manufacturing support.  The technique can be adapted to both new electron
              microscopes and the large existing base of SEMs - allowing the fullest use of
              SEM technology in materials characterization.  ***
