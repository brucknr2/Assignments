Abstract    :
              9411208         A research Workshop on The Interaction of Morphosyntax and 
              Lexicon in the Acquisition of Narrative Discourse will be held at  the 1995 LSA
              Linguistic Institute at the University of New Mexico  in Albuquerque. The
              objectives of the workshop are: (I) to bring  together experienced researchers
              who have done cross-linguistic  work on the development of the functions of
              morphosyntax in  narrative in order to compare findings across languages and 
              methodology across studies; (2) to enable less-experienced  researchers and
              students to work with these experts, to become  familiar with the current
              issues, learn the state-of-the-art  analysis techniques, and carry out
              summer-long collaborative  projects; (3) to facilitate the formation of new 
              interdisciplinary research collaborations which will extend  beyond the summer.
              In summary, the workshop will provide a  seminar setting for leaders,
              less-experienced researchers, and  students to compare their analyses across
              languages, with the  goal of testing and improving current theories of the
              acquisition  of lexical and grammatical devices used in narrative discourse.   
                   The workshop will be led by Ruth Berman and Dan Slobin, and  will focus on
              children's gradual mastery of the uses of the  morphosyntax of their languages
              to convey complex narrative  information, primarily utilizing the 'frog story'
              elicitation  paradigm. The workshop will be open to all institute faculty, 
              affiliates and students; those interested in the cross-language  comparison of
              morphosyntax in aphasia and in developmental  language disorders will
              especially be encouraged to participate.
