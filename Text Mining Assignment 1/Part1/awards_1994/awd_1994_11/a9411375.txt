Abstract    :
              9411375  Jones       This is an award to enable a group of United States  
              researchers in simulation to attend a conference on simulation to   be held at
              Waseda University, in Tokyo, Japan.  The objective of   the conference is to
              bring together researchers from the United   States and Japan to focus on the
              current state of research and new   directions in simulation as applied to
              manufacturing and   communications.  The conference is sponsored by the Special
                Interest Group on Systems Simulation, The Operations Research   Society of
              Japan, and the National Institute of Standards and   Technology.       The
              conference provides an opportunity for US researchers to   meet and discuss
              critical research issues with their counterparts   in Japan and other Far
              Eastern countries.  The limited focus on   manufacturing and communication
              provides an opportunity for an in-   depth analysis to assess the current state
              of application of   simulation technology in manufacturing and identify any
              major   obstacles present that must be overcome to move the technology  
              forward.  Simulation as a tool has been widely used in modeling and   analyzing
              many engineering problems, especially complex   manufacturing systems.
