Abstract    :
              9411856  Kareiva     The study of ominvores (animals that feed at more than one
              trophic level) has lagged behind studies of more specialized feeders; there
              have been no experimental studies of the roles of omnivores in natural
              communities.  Yet omnivores are abundant in most natural communities.  Through
              a series of manipulative field experiements, this project attempts to determine
              how omnivory influences arthropod assemblages, characterize the community
              effects of omnivory based on size structure of predator species, and predict
              the role of omnivory in stabilizing or destabilizing terrestrial ecosystems.   
              This research will improve our fundamental understanding of food web dynamics
              and the operation of ecosystems.  The results will have application in
              ecosystem management, management of biological reserves, and conservation of
              biodiversity.
