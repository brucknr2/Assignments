Abstract    :
              9411794  Winick  The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
              at  the University of Michigan will purchase an electron beam gun and  an
              intracavity frequency doubled argon ion laser to support  research in
              engineering.  The equipment will be used to fabricate  novel integrated optical
              devices in glasses and crystals.  This  proposal is an integral part of our
              on-going research program in  glass integrated optics.  We anticipate that the
              new devices,  developed as part of this effort, may eventually become important
               components in fiber-based optical communication and high density  optical
              storage systems.  As part of this program, we will develop  and exploit new
              fabrication technologies for glass waveguide  devices.  Specifically, rare
              earth waveguide lasers will be  fabricated, for the first time, in doped fused
              silica substrates  using low energy electron-beam irradiation.  Quasi-phase
              matched  second harmonic generation in poled fused silica samples will also  be
              demonstrated using electron beam technology.  In a closely  related effort,
              waveguide grating-based devices will be directly  written into planar
              germano-silicate substrates using the frequency  doubled argon ion laser. 
              Extensions of this direct write method to  include ion exchangeable glasses
              will be explored.  The successful  completion of this project should enhance
              the manufacturability of  a large class of integrated optical components.  ***
