Abstract    :
              9411142  Stetson  This award supports the participation of eight U.S. social and
              political scientists (including  two graduate students) in an international
              research planning workshop to be held in Western  Europe in March, 1995.  This
              activity was jointly organized by Professors Dorothy  McBride Stetson of
              Florida Atlantic University, Amy Mazur of Washington State  University, and
              Joyce Outshoorn of the University of Leiden, The Netherlands.  The  workshop
              will bring together U.S. and European scholars in political science and
              sociology  for the purpose of establishing priorities for comparative research
              on institutionalized  feminism and preparing research designs to conduct
              cross-national investigations of research  questions and hypotheses.  Invited
              participants in the workshop have expertise in  comparative politics and social
              theory, and research experience on the phenomenon of  women s policy
              institutions in one or more countries.  The U.S. participants will benefit 
              from the opportunity of working with counterparts from European countries where
              there is  a long tradition of inquiry into state theories.    Some of the most
              far-reaching changes in Western societies in the last 100 years have been 
              related to the changes in gender roles, specifically those associated with the
              massive  movement of women into the paid labor force and the parallel shifts in
              family relations,  child rearing and  political participation.  The term  state
              feminism  refers to the creation  of government agencies assigned to improve
              the status of women.  These include a variety  of forms from specialized
              bureaus or ministerial level offices to equal opportunity councils.  The
              workshop and ensuing collaborative research promises to make important
              contributions  to the development of empirically grounded theory of state
              capacities and state-society  relations.  ***
