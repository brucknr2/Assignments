Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  K. C.  Liddell    This is a study of the electrodeposition of
              compositionally modulated alloys.  Electrochemical and electron microprobe
              measurements provide complementary data on composition gradients in the
              multilayer copper-nickel system, a model for commercial magnetic data-storage
              systems.  Rotating ring disk electrode techniques enable in-situ  measurements
              of deposition rate and purity of an alloy in real time; however, such
              measurements are radially integrated.  Microprobe measurements show of
              composition as a function of radial position for a given layer and deposit
              thickness.  The experimental results are used to validate models of
              electrodeposition.    Electrodeposition shows great promise as a flexible and
              inexpensive means of producing nanostructured compositionally  modulated
              alloys.  This is of especial current interest for production of  high-quality
              magnetic recording heads and related data-storage applications.  However, the
              relationships between process variables and product  properties are not 
              understood well enough to permit optimization of electrodeposition processes
              based on first principles.  This study is intended to make such optimization
              less empirical.
