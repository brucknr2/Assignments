Abstract    :
              9411982  Bourque  This award is being made through the Small Grants for 
              Exploratory Research program to collect data on the January  17, 1994
              Northridge, California earthquake.  Data will be  collected on the reactions to
              the earthquake of a sample of  residents of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. 
              creation of  this data set will allow for the comparison of community  members'
              behavior in the reactions to earthquakes across  time within the Los Angeles
              area (1987 and 1994), across two  of the most earthquake-prone urban areas of
              the United  States (Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area), and three 
              earthquakes (Whittier Narrows, Loma Prieta, and Northridge).  The results of
              this analysis will increase understanding of  the societal response to
              earthquakes and provide a basis for  improving community preparedness.  ***
