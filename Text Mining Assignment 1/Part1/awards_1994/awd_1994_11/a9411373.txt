Abstract    :
              9411373  Williams  This is an award to support International Travel by the 
              applicant to attend and participate in the 12th CIGR World  Congress and AgEng
              '94 Conference on Agricultural  Engineering to be held in Milano, Italy from
              August 29 to  September 1, 1994.  Conference topics include sessions that  deal
              with environmentally significant issues in agricultural  waste management.  The
              applicant will present a paper on his  work with pollution control and energy
              recovery using an  anaerobic process for treatment of dairy wastes.   
              Agricultural wastes are a significant source of pollution to  environmental
              resources of land, water and air.  These  wastes are typically a diffuse,
              non-point source, control  over which is becoming of increasingly greater
              importance as  point sources become controlled by regulation, minimization 
              and/or treatment systems.  Results of the applicant's  participation in this
              conference are expected to assist in  determining the nature of research that
              could be applied to  addressing pollution problems posed by agricultural
              wastes.  ***
