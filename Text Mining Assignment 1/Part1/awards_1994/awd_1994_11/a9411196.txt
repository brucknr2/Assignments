Abstract    :
              9411196  Tsebelis  This Dissertation Improvement research examines how the 
              relationship between the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the  member states
              of the European Court affects the ability of the  ECJ to achieve integrationist
              goals.  This research will test  empirically several hypotheses about the
              institutional  constraints on ECJ decision making and the level of member 
              states' support required for the ECJ to render "pro" decisions  that are not
              mere dead letters.  This grant provides funds for  travel to field research
              locations that are necessary to  construct a dataset of all common market cases
              adjudicated by the  ECJ from 1958-1992.  The dataset will allow systematic
              empirical  investigation of decision making in the European Parliament.  The 
              dataset will include the different decisions of the Parliament,  their history
              (whether they came out of committee, or were  proposed on the floor), their
              support basis (the coalition that  made them successful), and their ultimate
              fate (whether they were  accepted by the other European institutions, and
              whether they  became European law).  This research will contribute to an 
              understanding of European integration that goes beyond what has  been provided
              by current relevant theories of neo-functionalism  and intergovernmentalism.
