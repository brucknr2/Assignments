Abstract    :
              9411384  Danyluk  Support is provided to enable three tribologists from the
              former  Soviet Union make research visits to Georgia Institute of  Technology. 
              There, they will assist in further refinement of  wear-sensing instrumentation,
              which is being developed by the PI  based on an original proposal by one of the
              visitors, Dr. Zharin  of Belarus.  The visit will also serve to initiate
              additional  cooperative research activities between the US, Belarus, and the 
              Ukraine.  ***
