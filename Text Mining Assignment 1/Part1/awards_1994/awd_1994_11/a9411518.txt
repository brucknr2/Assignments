Abstract    :
                  9411518  Weaver  This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the
               Department of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the University  of Illinois
              to purchase ultrasonic immersion scanning equipment,  consisting of a scanning
              bridge and tank, an x-y motor controller  and manual z-axis and orientation
              manipulators.  The equipment will  be used in two research projects dealing
              with the exploration of  the feasibility of ultrasonic diffuse field imaging of
              solid  mechanics materials with random microstructures and developing a  cure
              monitoring technique which can be integrated into automated  control schemes
              for economical manufacturing of polymer matrix  composites.  The equipment will
              also be used for more conventional  ultrasonic imaging as an aid to other
              research projects within the  Departments of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics
              and Applied  Mechanics and Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering.  ***
