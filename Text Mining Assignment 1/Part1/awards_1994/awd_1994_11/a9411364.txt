Abstract    :
              9411364   Shaulis  The Community College of Allegheny County requests support
              from NSF  for connection of its campus network to PREPnet. PREPnet is the 
              midlevel network located in the state of Pennsylvania. PREPnet will  provide
              operations management and information services and it will  give the Community
              College connection to the Internet, a collection  of interoperable networks
              that connect most research and education  organizations in the United States 
              The colleges need greater  functionality and network speed to be able to access
               supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being  able to
              implement a more reliable mail system. The connection will  benefit the faculty
              research, staff and students. This is also a  unique opportunity for the school
              to explore innovative educational  resources.
