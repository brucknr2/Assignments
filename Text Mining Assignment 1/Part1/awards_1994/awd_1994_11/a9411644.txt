Abstract    :
              9411644  LUCKOW   This award will pay for travel to conduct field work in China
              and laboratory supplies for molecular (chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequencing)
              studies to enhance the dissertation work of a PhD graduate student, Lawrence M.
              Kelly.  The research project of this student involves utilizing morphological
              and molecular data in a phylogenetic analysis or study of relationships among
              species groups in the genus Asarum and among Asarum and the five other genera
              that constitute the plant family Aristolochiaceae.  This family is understood
              to be the plant group most closely related to the monocots, the grasses,
              bamboos, lilies, etc..  This study will clarify relationships among major
              lineages, begin work on a full species-level treatment or monograph of the
              genus Asarum which includes approximately 80 species.  The phylogeny or pattern
              of relationships derived from these studies will be used to test hypotheses
              concerning the associations of swallowtail butterflies with these plants
              relative to their production of certain plant acids and modifications adapting
              these plants to pollination by fungus gnats.  %%%   This study will clarify
              relationships among members of a very interesting group of plants and test
              predictions about certain members and their biological associations with
              swallowtail butterflies.  Support for the training of graduate students in
              modern systematic methodologies is important for maintaining the workforce of
              scientists capable of addressing the questions and issues of biodiversity which
              are of increasing global concern.  ***
