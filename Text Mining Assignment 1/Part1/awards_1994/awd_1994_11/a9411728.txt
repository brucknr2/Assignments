Abstract    :
               9411728  KOCHER       Transposons are discrete genetic elements which can move
              from  site to site in the genome.  Transposition is a significant source  of
              spontaneous mutation in most, probably all, organisms.  It is  widely supposed
              that transposon insertions in coding regions cause  loss-of-function
              (knock-out) mutations.  This paradigm is the  product of the genetic methods
              (detection of phenotypic mutants)  which have been used to monitor transposon
              activity.  Recent  discoveries suggest that many transposons are efficiently
              spliced  from transcribed messages, and so do not induce phenotypic  mutations.
               The proportion of transposon insertion which have no  visible phenotypic
              effect is unknown.       Molecular methods will be used to detect transposon
              insertions  based on their DNA structure.  A large number of insertions in a 
              target gene will be isolated, and each characterized to determine  its
              phenotype and pattern of splicing.   The results will have  general
              implications for understanding the structure of eucaryotic  genomes, as well as
              applied benefits for the use of transposon  tools in molecular biology, and the
              detection and treatment of  transposon-induced mutations.
