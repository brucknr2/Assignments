Abstract    :
              9411666  Wenk    This US-Poland Research project between Dr. Hans-Rudolf Wenk of
               the University of California-Berkeley, and Dr. Jan Pospiech of  the Krupowski
              Institute for Metals Research of the Polish Academy  of Sciences, is a "Texture
              Analysis with Discrete Methods."   Interdisciplinary research between PAN
              Krakow and UC Berkeley  coordinated efforts to obtain quantitative information
              of  orientation characteristics of polycrystalline materials,  particularly
              those with low crystal and sample symmetry which are  not only typical in
              geology but in ceramics and polymer science  as well.  They showed that
              discrete methods have distinct  advantages to obtain the orientation
              distribution (OD) from a  minimum amount of experimental pole figure data. 
              Discrete  methods are also useful to obtain misorientation functions (MOD)  and
              other orientation characteristics describing correlations  between
              orientations.  This has been illustrated for copper,  quartz and calcite.  The
              researchers now propose to conclude this  project by generalizing computer
              programs for analysis of  individual orientation measurements and adding
              elements of the  component method for compact representation of texture data,
              all  using a discrete approach rather than the harmonic method which  easily
              introduces artifacts.  Programs will be made available to  the texture
              communities for testing and application to benefit a  larger constituency than
              the laboratories of the principal  investigators.     This project in
              geological sciences fulfills the program  objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling leading  experts in Poland and the United States to
              combine complementary  talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and  competence.  ***
