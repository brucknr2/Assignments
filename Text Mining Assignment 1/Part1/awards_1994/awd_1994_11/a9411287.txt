Abstract    :
                  This project conducts research that will lead to the implementation  and
              deployment of a digital library testbed and environment of  textual, video,
              still image, and data sets, from both primary and  secondary information
              suppliers.  The project will make available  capabilities and services to a
              large number of users at multiple  locations.  The basic approach is one of
              self-assembling agent  based federation of distributed collections.  The
              testbed is an  extension of existing DIRECT and TULIP projects.  The testbed 
              content is primarily concerned with the earth and space sciences.   The testbed
              will proceed in three releases, each incorporating  additional information and
              making available more advanced  capabilities.  Usage and user evaluations will
              be reincorporated  into the testbed to contribute to rational system evolution.
