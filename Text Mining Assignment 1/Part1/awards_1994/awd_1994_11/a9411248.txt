Abstract    :
              9411248  Doering  The thermochemistry of extended conjugation of carbon-carbon  
              double bonds to a radical center will be determined. The   stabilization energy
              for each incremental double bond will   be determined and, where possible,
              compared to theoretical   predictions. By the use of specially chosen rigid
              conjugated   polyenes, the effects of alkyl substituents and   configuration
              can be sorted out to give a unique value for   the stabilization energy
              increment for each added double   bond. The interaction of phenyl groups with
              the conjugated   p-system will also be pursued. These results will be  
              extended to a study of cycloaddition and cycloreversion   reactions that are
              interpreted in terms of a biradical   process. In addition to the simple
              dimerization of two   ethylenes, the cycloaddition reactions will include the  
              Diels-Alder reaction and the Cope rearrangement.    This grant from the Organic
              Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor William von Eggers
              Doering at   Harvard University. A carbon-carbon double bond unit   connected
              to a carbon with one odd electron (a   tricoordinated carbon atom or radical
              center) will stabilize   the radical center. The magnitude of this
              stabilization   energy and the amount of stabilization of each successively  
              added carbon-carbon double bond unit will be determined by   the use of
              specially designed molecules. In conjunction with   the determination of these
              stabilization energies, the   thermochemistry of carbon-carbon double bonds to
              form cyclic   molecules through the intermediacy of a species with two  
              radical centers ( a biradical) will be determined.
