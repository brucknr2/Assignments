Abstract    :
              9411834  Kier    The brittle star sensory system is paradoxical in that it 
              combines high reactivity, quick movements, and occasional  predatory behavior
              with a total lack of a discrete sense organ.  In addition brittle stars can
              discriminate between polarized and  unpolarized light and this perception could
              be based on  differential light transmission through a polarizing skeleton. 
              This study will provide crucial information on (1) the nature and  capabilities
              of diffuse sensory systems and (2) a possibly novel  mechanism  of polarization
              sensitivity. Experiments will  determine whether and how the novel optical
              property of the  endoskeleton of the brittle star is used by the animal. This 
              proposal outlines the first opportunity to study the function of  a biological
              polarizing filter.  ***
