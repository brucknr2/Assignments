Abstract    :
              9411568  Altman    Equipment to be installed in an existing ultrahigh-vacuum
              system is acquired.  This includes a double-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer
              for Auger electron spectroscopy and low-energy ion-scattering spectroscopy, a
              low-energy electron diffraction system, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer for
              thermal desorption.  This  equipment is to be used with a high-speed,
              variable-temperature, scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to study the
              dynamics of processes at surfaces.    Projects using this equipment include
              studies of etching reactions at metal surfaces, kinetic measurements of
              adsorption, desorption, and reaction rates at specific sites on oxide surfaces,
              and studies of surface intermixing during nucleation and growth of thin metal
              films.  ***
