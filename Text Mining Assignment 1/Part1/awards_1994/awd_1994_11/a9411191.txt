Abstract    :
                  9411191  Suthers    Vocal behaviors represent complex outputs of the nervous
               system with great behavioral and social significance.  These  behaviors,
              whether in primates or birds, demonstrate (a) a  strong dependence on learning,
              and (b) complexities of  neural control such as lateralization -- unequal
              control by  the two sides of the nervous system.  In the past,  investigation
              of these phenomena in animal systems has  relied very heavily on surgical
              disruption of the pathways  controlling vocalization.     In this proposal, a
              research team headed by Dr. R. Suthers  will study the development of avian
              vocal behavior using new  techniques that allow many fine details of vocal
              control to  be analyzed without surgical disruption.  These studies will 
              enable Dr. Suther's team to uncover the normal controls on  the development of
              coordination between the two sides of the  song production organ, the syrinx. 
              They will also allow new  understanding of how the patterns of coordination are
               acquired by juveniles, and how complex aspects of tonality  are produced. 
              These studies will enhance our knowledge of  the biology of communication
              systems, and are directly  relevant to speech communication and linguistics.
