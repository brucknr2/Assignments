Abstract    :
                     9411667  Collier       This project is the dissertation research of a
              cultural  anthropology student from Stanford, California.  The project will 
              examine how residents of Granada, Spain understand their legal  and cultural
              (ethnic) identities in light of recent social and  political changes.  The
              student will interview Spaniards who  migrated to northern Europe a generation
              ago and returned, and  compare them to Spaniards of Moroccan ancestry who
              migrated to  Spain more recently.  Both groups were considered culturally 
              "inferior" in the place they migrated to, and now are part of the  expanded
              European Economic Community.  The project will describe  how these people
              understand the "rebordering" of the  mediterranean through an examination of
              oral histories,  participant observation, archival research.       This
              research is important because it will illuminate the  changes in ethnic
              relations in a country that was previously  thought to be more foreign but is
              now more tightly integrated  into the European community.  Understanding how
              people change  their sense of being "at home" in different places will help 
              planners develop programs to better integrate foreigners into  host societies.
