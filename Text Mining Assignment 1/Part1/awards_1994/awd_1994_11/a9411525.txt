Abstract    :
              9411525  Gevelber           ABSTRACT    Accelerated MS in Manufacturing for
              Practicing Engineers    Boston University has the only Manufacturing
              Engineering Department in the country that grants manufacturing degrees at all
              levels.  It offers a part-time 17-month master of Science in Manufacturing
              program to train experienced engineers for dual-use manufacturing careers.  TRP
              funds will create fellowships for unemployed engineers and partial fellowships
              for engineers employed by small businesses affected by defense conversion. 
              Industry involvement in this program will include guest lectures, sponsorship
              of student capstone projects, and tuition support for sending students to the
              program.  ***
