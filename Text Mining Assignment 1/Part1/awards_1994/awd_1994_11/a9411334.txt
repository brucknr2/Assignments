Abstract    :
              This project implements a prototype digital library focussed on  environmental
              information, with a concentration on the utilization,  evaluation and
              preparation of environmental impact reports,  statements and related documents.
               The prototype system is intended  for eventual full-scale deployment in the
              State of California's  CERES production systems.  The research plan has three
              primary  goals:  provision of a coherent, content-based view of a diverse  set
              of information objects distributed geographically; achievement  of scalability
              to very large collections, clients and servers, and  the development of new
              data acquisition technologies.    The project strong reliance upon the success
              of extending alpeady  developed conventional DBMS technologies to support of
              subelement  access and content-based views.  More radical approaches are 
              planned for automated document segmentation and topic  characterization in
              order to define and locate material in a "topic  space" and image analysis for
              retrieval and browsing.
