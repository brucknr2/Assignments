Abstract    :
              9411030  Heinekey  University of Washington  Dr. Michael Heinekey, Chemistry
              Department, University of Washington, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for the study of the high
              temperature pairwise proton tunnelling which occurs in polyhydride metal
              complexes. A series of new dihydride and polyhydride of a variety of metals
              will be prepared. By altering the metal and ancillary ligands stable
              dihydrogen, dihydrogen-hydride, and polyhydride complexes which show large
              hydrogen-hydrogen spin couplings will be obtained. An analysis of the
              temperature dependency of the couplings which occur in these complexes will
              reveal whether  hydrogen exchange occurs by a quantum mechanical tunnelling
              mechanism. A significant portion of the study will involve the study of
              hydrides into which deuterium or tritium has been incorporated. Tritium nmr
              will be used to characterize the behavior of some of these systems.    Hydrogen
              molecules may be activated by allowing them to interact with metal atoms. This
              behavior has tremendous utility and used in laboratory and industrial chemistry
              to increase the ability of hydrogen to undergo many reactions, including
              virtually all "hydrogenation" reactions. One specific example is the process in
              which unsaturated fats are converted into saturated ones. In another respect,
              the interactions between hydrogen and metals has become an important topic with
              the increased interest in hydrogen as a clean fuel. In this project the
              fundamental ways in which hydrogen becomes attached to a metal will be
              investigated and the details of how hydrogen atoms interchange with each other
              under the influence of a metal will be determined.
