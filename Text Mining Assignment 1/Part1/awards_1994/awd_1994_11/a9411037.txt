Abstract    :
              9411037  Hennage  This award provides for support of the 1994 Compact Blue-Green
              Lasers Topical Meeting, to be held February 10-11, 1994 at the Salt Lake City
              Marriott in Salt Lake City, Utah, and will provide support for partial travel
              for four Russian scientists to attend the Compact Blue-Green Laser (CBGL)
              Conference:   K. S. Buritskii   V. A. Chernyh   E. A. Shcherbakov   V. A. 
              Maslov  These four scientists are co-authors on two oral papers that will be
              presented at the CBGL conference, as well as on two post-deadline papers they
              plan on submitting.  This conference emphasizes low cost, efficient, compact
              laser sources, for a broad range of commercial applications and has been
              attended by many researchers in this field and by many potential customers of
              these laser sources.  ***
