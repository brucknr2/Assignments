Abstract    :
              9411724  Pankow  This is an award to assist in the purchase of equipment for 
              conduct of research.  Topics of the investigator's research on  which the
              equipment will be used includes mechanisms of the  reductive dehalogenation of
              chlorinated organic compounds by  elemental iron, gas/particle partitioning of
              organic compounds in  atmospheric aerosols and gas/particle partitioning of
              toxic  compounds in air that has been polluted with tobacco smoke.   
              Acquisition of the equipment to be purchased with this support  will have a
              significant effect on improving the productivity of  this investigator's
              laboratory in connection with its work on  topics of important environmental
              significance.  The proposal  leading to this award was submitted in response to
              NSF 93-155,  Research Equipment Grant Program.  ***
