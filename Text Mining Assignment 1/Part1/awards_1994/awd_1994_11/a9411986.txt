Abstract    :
                  Levitan  9411986    Post-zygotic mortality is considered to be the primary 
              selective agent in the evolution of propagule size in many  taxa, including
              marine invertebrates.  Unfortunately,  theoretical predictions of marine
              invertebrate egg size  based on post-zygotic mortality have been difficult to
              test  and are often at odds with the empirical data.  This study  will conduct
              a series of laboratory experiments that will  measure egg size, sperm swimming
              ability, and fertilization  rates, and a series of field experiments that will
              determine  how these gamete attributes influence rates of fertilization  under
              different environmental conditions.  In one experiment  , DNA fingerprints of
              single larva will provide answers to  how specific gamete attributes influence
              rates of  fertilization and mediate the outcome of sperm competition. 
              Incorporating fertilization into a comprehensive life-  history theory will
              resolve many of the apparent paradoxes  between the empirical  evidence and
              previous theories.    ***
