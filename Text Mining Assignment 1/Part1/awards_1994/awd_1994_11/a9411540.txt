Abstract    :
              9411540  Lewontin         A basic assumption of biology is that there are
              trade-offs  between the three competing demands of growth, reproduction, and 
              survival. Resources diverted from reproduction are predicted to  increase
              growth and/or survivorship, such that there is some  "cost" to maintaining the
              reproductive system, This research  tests that prediction by measuring the
              variety and severity of  pathological lesions in aged animals. Reproduction
              will be  suppressed experimentally in house mice. Reallocation of  resources to
              growth and survivorship will be evaluated over the  entire life span, by
              monitoring growth and by utilizing a number  of behavioral, biochemical, and
              pathological measures.
