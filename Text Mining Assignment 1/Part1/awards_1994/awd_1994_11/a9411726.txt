Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to purchase a wavelength discriminating imaging
              system which will be dedicated to support research programs in catalysis and
              combustion, and undergraduate laboratory experiments.  The imaging system
              requested consists of a scanning mechanism, a detector with high sensitivity in
              the visible to near-IR, and a 0.5m imaging spectrograph along with signal
              processing components.  This equipment would allow the measurement of surface
              temperatures from approximately 700K to greater than 2000K and resolved both
              spatially (~ 50  m), and temporally (sub-second to ms).  Multi-user use is
              anticipated.
