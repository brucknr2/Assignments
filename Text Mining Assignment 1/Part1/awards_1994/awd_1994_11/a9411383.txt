Abstract    :
                  9411383  Batra  This is a project to compute the characteristics of shear
              banding.   It has a companion experimental projects that will examine the 
              effects of microscopic mechanisms, geometric defects and material  properties
              on shear localization.  The concept is to do  calculations on the same problem
              as the experiments represent.  ***
