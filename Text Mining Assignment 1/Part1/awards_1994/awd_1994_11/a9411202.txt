Abstract    :
              ***  9411202  Stein    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will design and develop a two-wavelength active pyrometer.  Many production and
              research applications require accurate, non-contact surface temperature
              measurements on various materials under a variety of conditions.  All such
              surfaces emit radiation, which may be used to measure their surface
              temperatures, providing the surface's emissivity is known.  Unfortunately,
              emissivity values are frequently uncertain, which can lead to large errors in
              conventional radiation pyrometry.  This research concerns a new active
              pyrometer method, wherein the ratio of target reflectances at two separate
              wavelengths is measured together with the target radiances at these same
              wavelengths.  From these values the surface emissivity may be determined and
              the target temperature accurately measured for materials having arbitrary
              surface textures. Research completed under a Phase I program has determined
              that it is feasible to construct such an instrument to cover a target
              temperature range of 100-1750( C with an accuracy of + 0.5% of the absolute
              temperature.  This is perhaps an order-of-magnitude better than can be realized
              with conventional radiation pyrometry when the target emissivity is not known,
              or is changing.        The new pyrometer would help producers and manufacturers
              in many industries to improve the quality and reduce the cost of their
              research, factory processes and products. Commercial applications include:
              production of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, semiconductors, plastics, foods,
              textiles,  etc., where non-contacting temperature measurements are needed and
              conventional pyrometry is often inadequate.  ***
