Abstract    :
              9411224  GARCIA  The purpose of this project is to discover how the
              interactional  process of mediation contributes to agreement between disputing 
              parties.  Specifically, how does mediation provide for  negotiation about
              proposed solutions in a way that facilitates  dispute resolution rather than
              continued disagreement?  Previous  research has shown that agreement in
              mediation is more likely if  participants engage in the creative generation of
              ideas for  potential solutions.  Negotiation procedures which include such 
              activities are more likely to result in "win-win" solutions--  those that
              benefit both disputants.  However, previous research  also suggests that these
              benefits result only if the participants  are not committed to particular
              solutions.  Additional data are  needed to determine if there is a critical
              difference between how  mediators and disputants propose and/or interpret
              proposed  solutions: as possibilities or as requirements for resolution.   
              Approximately 30 mediation hearings at a community mediation  program will be
              observed and video-taped.  Transcripts of each  hearing and detailed
              observation records will be produced by  graduate student research assistants. 
              These data will be coded  for analysis by the principal investigator, using
              theoretically  defined categories of disputing behavior.  On the basis of the 
              coded data, the principal investigator will compare the  interactional
              interpretations of mediators and disputants as they  propose and work toward
              resolutions.  ***
