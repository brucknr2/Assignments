Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  CTS-9411569  University of Houston  P.I.:  F. Hussain      This
              equipment will support the purchase of a modern data acquisition and control
              system for the Aerodynamics and Turbulence Laboratory.  This unit will be used
              for real-time experiment control, multi-channel data acquisition, and data
              analysis for turbulence research.  Since both dynamical and structrual
              approaches will be used, acquisition and analysis of large amount of low-noise,
              high-resolution multi-channel data are necessary.  Research in the upgrade
              laboratory will likely make a significant contribution to the field of
              turbulence.
