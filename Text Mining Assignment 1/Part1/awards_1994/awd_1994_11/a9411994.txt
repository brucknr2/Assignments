Abstract    :
              9411994  Williams       Nontraditional Manufacturing processes are being used to
               produce geometrically complex and highly accurate parts from modern 
              materials.  This project involves an effort to link abrasive flow  machining
              (AFM) research with a leading machine tool builder of the  equipment.  The
              project will involve the principal investigator  spending one summer at the
              machine tool builder.  The project  entails three major objectives:  (1)
              Integration of abrasive flow  machining research results into industrial
              applications.   Particularly, the use of the acoustic emission monitoring
              system.   (2) Involvement of graduate engineering students in the AFM  research
              projects.  This will include students from colleges and  universities.  (3)
              Exposure of the academic researcher to the  competitive issues facing the
              machine tool builders.       Expected benefits include enhanced technology of
              the abrasive  flow-machining systems, greater understanding of AFM and better 
              awareness of industry needs, and the establishment of long-term  collaborative
              research efforts.
