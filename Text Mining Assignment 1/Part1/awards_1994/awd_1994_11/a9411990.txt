Abstract    :
              9411990  Abel    This grant supports a Joint US-Russia Workshop on Ocean and 
              Oceanic Atmospheric Technology Research on "Techniques and  Capabilities for
              Ocean Observations, Measurements of  Environmental Change, Resource Assessment,
              and Sustainable  Development" to be held in Moscow.  The US side will be led by
               Dr. Robert Abel of the New Jersey Marine Science Consortium at  Stevens
              Institute of Technology.  The workshop provides for an  exchange of technology
              information on techniques and  capabilities, and for the development and
              application of this  technology for specific projects of mutual interest in
              ocean  observations, measurements of environment change, and for  resource
              assessment and sustainable development.  The researchers  will focus on: (1)
              Advances in Ocean Survey Technology; (2)  Sensors/Instrumentation Systems; and
              (3) automated, unmanned,  untethered undersea vehicles and robotics capability.
               The  workshop will increase the technical knowledge base and identify  areas
              for cooperative engineering research in advanced ocean  technology where,
              historically, a major portion was developed  under military auspices.        
              This project in biological and critical systems fulfills the  program objective
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling  leading experts in Russia and
              the United States to combine  complementary talents and pool resources in areas
              of strong  mutual interest and competence.  ***
