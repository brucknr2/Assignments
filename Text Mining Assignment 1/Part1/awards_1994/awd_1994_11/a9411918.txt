Abstract    :
              9411918  ENGEL  This study explores the potential effectiveness of the Americans
               with Disabilities Act of 1990.  Legal entitlements often fail to  achieve
              their intended results because the beneficiaries are  unwilling to perceive
              themselves as entitled to civil rights  protections, and are therefore
              unwilling to invoke the law.  This  research asks whether American with
              disabilities view the law as  relevant to their aspirations to obtain
              employment and whether  they are prepared to use the law in the hiring process
              or in  obtaining on-the-job accommodations for their disabilities.     
              Extensive, in-depth interviews will be conducted with persons who  use a
              wheelchair, persons with learning disabilities, and a  control group at each of
              three different life stages.  The  contrasting experiences with disability and
              working will provide  important data about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness
              of the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and about the reasons  why
              persons with disabilities do or do not make use of the law.  ***
