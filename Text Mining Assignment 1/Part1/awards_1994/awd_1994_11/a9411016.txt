Abstract    :
              9411016  Stoltman    Under the direction of Dr. James Stoltman, Mr. Patrick
              Lubinski  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. The work  consists
              of two phases. In December 1991 a herd of 150 Wyoming  proghorn antelope fell
              over a cliff on a foggy day and were  killed. The skeletal remains have been
              collected and through  analysis of dental remains it is possible to reconstruct
              the age  profile of the group and to improve criteria for aging skeletal 
              remains of this species. In the first part of his research, Mr.  Lubinski will
              study these materials. On this basis he will then  examine a series of proghorn
              skeletal remains collected from many  sites and time periods in the Great Basin
              region. Prehistoric  peoples hunted this species widely and Mr. Lubinski's goal
              is to  reconstruct changing utilization patterns over time.    This work is
              important for several reasons. Archaeological  evidence suggests that over time
              intensified resource use  occurred in the Great Basin and that human groups
              tended to  specialize and focus on limited types of food. While this process 
              is well documented in other parts of the world and led to the  domestication of
              plants and animals, it would be surprising and  unusual if such a process took
              place in a desertic Great Basin  environment. Mr. Lubinski will examine this
              phenomenon. Secondly,  the research will contribute basic biological data which
              will be  useful to archaeologists who study and attempt to interpret  faunal
              remains. Finally, this project will contribute to the  training of a promising
              young scientist.  ***
