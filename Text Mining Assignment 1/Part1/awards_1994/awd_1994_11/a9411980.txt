Abstract    :
              9411980  Hoyt    A novel flow visualization technique for large scale flow 
              structures, with particular application to turbulent eddy flows, is  proposed. 
              The method consists in generating visualizing fluid  filaments, of specific
              density close to unity, and then using them  as tracers.  The essential issue
              is maintaining the filament  coherence and diameter.  Long-chain polymer
              solutions and specially  prepared surfactant solutions will be used for
              filaments.  Dual  exposure photographs, with quantitatively evaluate local flow
               structures.  The method is simple, cost effective and can be easily  applied
              once the best composition of the filament has been  established.  ***
