Abstract    :
              This is a project to perform laboratory measurements and modeling  to determine
              the predissociation rate of the c'(0)-x(0) transition  in molecular nitrogen. 
              The results will be used with a model to  determine the temperature dependence
              of absorption oscillator  strength, A-factors for radiative branching into the
              vibrational  levels of ground state molecular nitrogen, and fractional 
              predissociation.  These data will facilitate an unambiguous  identification of
              the rotationally resolved emission spectra of  nitrogen and provide a basis for
              calculating, comparing and  analyzing the absolute photoexcitation,
              photodissociation, electron  impact excitation, and electron impact
              dissociation cross sections  of nitrogen.  This information will be useful in
              the interpretation  of spectroscopic measurements of the upper atmosphere.
