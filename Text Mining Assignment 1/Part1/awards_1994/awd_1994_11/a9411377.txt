Abstract    :
              This is a technical proposal to replace the existing 400 Mbyte  capacity
              recording system in the thirty ONR ocean bottom  seismometer instruments with
              new systems with a capacity in excess  of 2 gigabytes.  The ONR instruments are
              operated by Scripps  Institution of Oceanography and Woods Hole Oceanographic 
              Institution as a facility for the US academic community.  Thus this  improved
              recording capacity can potentially benefit a side range of  marine seismic
              experiments.
