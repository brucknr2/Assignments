Abstract    :
              9411988  Lewis  The NSF/OPP is developing a design concept to replaces
              facilities  at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica.  The 
              development of concepts began approximately three years ago.  The  plans are to
              complete the concept development by July 1994, so that  initial funding for
              replacement of facilities can be submitted in  the FY-96 budget request.  This
              contract with Jackson and Tull  Chartered Engineers will provide technical and
              management support  for reviewing and documenting design requirements for the 
              replacement facilities.    Jackson and Tull's responsibility will be to develop
              a review  procedure and manage the review process to meet the FY-96 budget 
              submission schedule.  In general, the review process will consist  of peer
              reviews for each management, functional, and operational  area of
              responsibility.  A non-advocate review will be conducted to  examine the review
              process and validate the basis of design for  final engineering and
              congressional funding.  Jackson and Tull are  to provide a Project Manager,
              Subsystems Engineer, Configuration  Manager and administrative support.    The
              review process will begin on February 1, 1994 and be completed  by July 1994. 
              To meet this schedule a pre-contract award to  Jackson and Tull is recommended.
               This pre-contract award is  recommended for $200,000.  $450,000 has been
              obligated for the  completed task.  ***
