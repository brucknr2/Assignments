Abstract    :
              9411771  Natland    This is a cruise to dredge igneous rock samples from a
              2200-km long  section of the Pacific-Antarctic East Pacific Rise between 35 and
               56 degrees south.  The work will provide a systematic petrologic  comparison
              between eruptive rocks along straight ridge segments and  those obtained both
              from adjoining overshot ridges constructed on  the floors of transform faults
              and from isolated intra-transform  spreading segments in the same transform
              domains.  The work will  also provide samples from a region that has not
              previously been  sampled.
