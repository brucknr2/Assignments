Abstract    :
                  Self-incompatibility (SI) in plants had long been assumed to be  ancestral
              to the angiosperms, but is now known to have evolved  repeatedly from a
              pre-existing multigene family.  The objective of  this work is to determine the
              time of origin of SI within the  Solanaceae.  Amino acid sequences of both S
              and non-S alleles of  several species in the Solanaceae will be determined and 
              phylogenetic trees based on sequence divergence of both S and non-S  RNases
              will be constructed to obtain an estimate of their relative  rates of
              evolution.  This project should result in an estimation of  the age of the SI
              system within the Solanaceae, sequences for non  S-RNases that also can be used
              by other researchers, and an  indication of the nature of selection acting on
              the non-S RNases.        The Solanaceae include a number of commerically
              important  plant species, including tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco.  An 
              understanding of the diversity of SI systems has important  implications for
              crop breeding.
