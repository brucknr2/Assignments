Abstract    :
              9411619  Mickelson  This proposal is for sponsorship of a small workshop to be
              held  with approximately 25-35 participants from industry, universities,  and
              government laboratories and agencies.  All participants will be  involved in
              optoelectronic packaging.  The purpose will be to try  to foster discussion
              between packaging researchers and students,  from different mother disciplines,
              through having them discuss  specific design problems in optoelectronic
              packaging.  Graduate  students will be encouraged to attend the workshop
              through travel  support.  Such non-classroom education will enhance students' 
              experiences through group discussions and poster exchanges.  ***
