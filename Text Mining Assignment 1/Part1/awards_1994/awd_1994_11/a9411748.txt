Abstract    :
              9411748  Kastner      Large single crystals, about a centimeter cube in volume,
              of  layered copper oxides grown at Massachusetts Institute of  Technology will
              be used for non-chemical methods of adding charge  carriers.  Photoexcitation
              of electrons and holes will be studied  using transient photoconductivity and
              photo-induced optical  absorption.  External electric fields will be applied in
              a field-  effect-transistor geometry to add electrons or holes.  Two 
              compounds, previously studied using chemical doping and, which  become
              superconducting when electrons and holes are added,  respectively will be
              investigated.  Also to be studied is a third  compound which cannot be doped by
              other means.    %  %  %  %    High temperature superconductivity results from
              chemical doping of  oxide semiconductors to change the density of electrons in
              them.   To understand the mechanism that leads to this interesting and 
              potentially useful phenomenon one would like to introduce electrons  without
              the disorder which is inherent in chemical doping.  The  proposed work will use
              large crystals of the copper oxides to  explore two ways of doing this.  In
              one, electrons will be added by  exposure to light.  In the other they will be
              added by an external  electric field.  ***
