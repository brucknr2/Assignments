Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-941167  Stull    The objective of this research is to explain
              atmospheric exchange  processes near the surface.  Because the boundary layer
              has finite  thickness, processes at the bottom, in the interior, and the top of
               the boundary layer interact to modulate the next exchange.  We will  develop
              theories, gather new field data, and utilize existing data  to study exchange
              processes at these three levels.    To investigate processes at the bottom, we
              will examine the role of  convective thermals in causing substantial surface
              transport during  calm wind conditions.  A relevant application is to the
              equatorial  western Pacific, where heat and moisture fluxes contribute 
              significantly to the global energy budget, but which are not well  explained by
              traditional drag laws.         Thermals also create a poorly-understood layer
              between the surface-  layer and the mixed layer, which we will study with a
              variety of  airborne platforms and wind profilers.        Over heterogeneous
              topography, the boundary-layer top is not  level.  This causes complex scalings
              in the boundary layer, and   plays a major role in convective cloud formation. 
              We will  investigate the levelness of the mixed-layer top with field data  and
              with theory.
