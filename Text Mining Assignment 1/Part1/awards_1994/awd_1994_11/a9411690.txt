Abstract    :
                        ABSTRACT  P. K. Yeung  Georgia Institute of Technology  CTS-9411690   
                The proposal is to upgrade an existing workstation rated at 30 Megaflops to
              beyond 100 Megaflops and also to increase storage and memory space.  This
              equipment will be used in support of two research projects:  Diffusion with
              reaction and heating effects and Lagrangian studies of turbulence and scalar
              transport.  The first of these is funded by an existing NSF Research Initiation
              Grant.  The work is being extended to included flows with exothermic reactions
              and fluids with variable density.  The inclusion of these effects implies the
              need for more CPU speed and memory.  The second project requires the tracking
              of many fluid particles and, hence, large data sets are used.  This will be
              facilitated by the additional memory and disk space.
