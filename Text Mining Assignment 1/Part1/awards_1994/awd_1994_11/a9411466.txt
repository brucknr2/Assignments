Abstract    :
              9411466  Sheaff  This Americas Program award will support participation  of U.S.
              and Latin American physicists and students in  a workshop on high energy
              physics,  to be held in  Cusco, Peru, August 1-13, 1994.  Organizers are Dr. 
              Marleigh Sheaff, University of Wisconsin, and  Professor Juvenal Castromonte
              Salinas, Universidad  Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima.  The program will 
              include courses and conferences on theoretical and  experimental H.E.P., and an
              introduction to selected  basic experimental techniques on high energy
              particles  detection.  The purpose of the meeting is to stimulate  interest in
              physics in Peru and other developing  countries in Latin America, with the aim
              of  encouraging future international collaboration in the  field.    This
              meeting will assist young Latin American  scientists in their efforts to revive
              and revitalize  their science programs and build the research  infrastructure. 
              Robust science programs, and the  technological stimulation that results from
              them, will  help to make the developing countries in our  hemisphere stronger
              partners in the future.  ***
