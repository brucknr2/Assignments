Abstract    :
                 Fundamental experiments on the fluid mechanical and heat transfer aspects of
              turbulent subcooled bubbly boiling flow were proposed.  The experiments will
              focus on the turbulent velocity and temperature fields of the liquid and vapor
              phases and also on the spatial distributions of vapor fraction, bubble size,
              and time-average interfacial area concentration.  A two-component laser Doppler
              Velocimeter featuring three detectors, fast micro-thermocouples, and
              phase-sensitive dual sensor fiber-optic probes will be used for the
              measurements.  Closure laws and models will be obtained from the experimental
              data via careful scrutiny and analyses.  Quantities for which these laws and
              models will be sought include:  Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat flux in
              the liquid phase, local time-average interfacial area concentration, and
              transfer rates of momentum and thermal energy at the vapor-liquid interfaces. 
              The closure laws and models will be incorporated in a three-dimensional
              two-fluid computational code that is presently under development at Electricit 
              de France.  The final goal will be to contribute toward the validation of this
              computational code with appropriate experimental data obtained in the
              laboratory.
