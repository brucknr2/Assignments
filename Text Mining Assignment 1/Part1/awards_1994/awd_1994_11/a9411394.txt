Abstract    :
              9411394  Berry  This research proposal focuses on the development of a
              reasonably large suite of real scientific application programs for execution on
              networks of high-performance workstations or within a limited distributed
              computing environment with a relatively fast network (e.g., 32-processor
              Thinking Machines CM-5).  This suite of Scientific Applications for Distributed
              Instrumentation and Execution of SADIE can be used a testbed of real scientific
              applications by computational scientists to evaluate and benchmark software
              tools or environments for various distributed computing environments.  SADIE
              will facilitate the development of performance prediction models which can
              assess the suitability of a given environment for a particular application or
              subset of applications.  Realistic memory, CPU speeds, and network latencies
              needed to execute scientific applications will be quantified using several
              distributed computing software systems,  Candidate support software systems for
              SADIE include PVM, P4, CONDOR, and Linda.  By constructing a testbed of
              applications, the effectiveness of popular (underlying) algorithms which
              previously performs well on massively-parallel platforms can be assessed. 
              Alternative strategies/algorithms for distributed environments can be compared
              so that a classification in which algorithms are ranked (in suitability)
              according to certain network conditions is produced.  SADIE comprises a diverse
              set of scientific applications: modeling high-temperature supercomputers,
              modeling piezoelectric crystals, first principles simulation of material
              properties, large-scale information retrieval, computational ecology, and
              finite element computations on unstructured meshes.  The corresponding set of
              dominant algorithms used within SADIE includes: the solution of linear systems,
              SVD and generalized symmetric eigenproblems, adaptive mesh refinement, matrix
              assembly from finite element meshes, and cluster/patch identification geometry.
