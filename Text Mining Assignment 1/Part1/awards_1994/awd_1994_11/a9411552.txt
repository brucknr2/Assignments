Abstract    :
              9411552  Chandrasekhar       The award is for the purchase of a cylindrical
              grinding  machine and a high-speed grinding spindle which will be used to 
              support research on grinding processes.  The equipment will be used  for
              several research projects including grinding of hardened steels  for
              tribological performance, chemically assisted grinding of  ceramics,
              microelectromechanical sensors for torque and contact  pressure measurements,
              cylindrical grinding temperatures, grinding  wheel-work contact stiffness and
              high-performance grinding with CBN  and diamond wheels on high-speed spindles. 
                   The research will result in better understanding of the  contact mechanics
              and dynamics of precision, cylindrical grinding.   Since this process is widely
              used in the automotive industry and  for manufacturing precision components in
              a variety of industries,  the results of the research are potentially useful in
              a broad range  of applications.
