Abstract    :
              9411945  Pienkowski  This Equipment Grant proposes the purchase of an electronic
               controller (with computer related accessories) for a  servohydraulic
              biomaterials test system that is dedicated to  support research in biomaterials
              engineering.  This device  will regulate the movement of a hydraulically driven
              piston  which pulls or pushes on a test specimen, measures the force  exerted
              on the specimen and the change in length of the  specimen, and calculates
              specific engineering materials  properties.     Materials engineering research
              techniques provide  fundamental knowledge regarding the causes and treatments 
              for osteoporotic bone.  The proposed equipment will also  create new
              opportunities for hands-on-involvement of  undergraduate students in ongoing
              research projects.  ***
