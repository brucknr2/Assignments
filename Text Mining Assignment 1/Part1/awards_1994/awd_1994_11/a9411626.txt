Abstract    :
                    This  is  a  project  to examine how  individuals  and  households adapt
              to traumatic economic hardship and  change.  The  research  will be based
              primarily on  a  survey  to  be  conducted in 600 households in both urban and
              rural areas of  Lublin, Poland.  The survey will collect systematic data  on 
              the  nature  of  the  economic hardships and  changes  being  experienced and a
              variety of conditions and past experiences  that influence how households adapt
              to economic stress.       The economic changes that are sweeping the countries
              of  the  former Soviet bloc are having a dramatic impact on  the  lives  of
              ordinary citizens in those countries.  The  future  stability  of  these 
              societies depends  to  a  considerable  extent  on  whether individuals and
              families  can  adapt  to  these  changes  and achieve family goals  better 
              than  they  could  under the old socialist system.  Poland, as a  leader  in 
              implementing  market  reforms in  the  post-Soviet  era,  represents  a 
              particularly  important  case  we   need   to  understand.  This project, by
              collecting systematic data  on  adaptation  to economic change in one area of 
              Poland,  will  increase our understanding of the momentous changes underway  in
              that society and their implications for the future.
