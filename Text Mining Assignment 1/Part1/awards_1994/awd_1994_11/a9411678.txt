Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to purchase a Time-of Flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometer
              system and to upgrade an existing Nd:YAG laser system.  The equipment will be
              used in conjunction with a planned fast-flow reactor/Resonance Enhanced
              Multiphoton Ionization (REMPI)-TOF facility in support of several research
              projects related to the incineration of hazardous wastes.
