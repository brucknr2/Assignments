Abstract    :
              949411273  Gilliam    This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project
              addresses  apparent contradictions in the literature on public opinion and 
              Congressional responsiveness.  That is, while decades of public  opinion
              research indicate that the voters are ill-informed on  issues of public policy,
              the literature on Congress demonstrates  that legislative behavior accurately
              reflects the preferences of  their constituents.  It seems unlikely that
              congressmen would  behave as they do unless voters ultimately possessed
              information  to punish those legislators who were not responsive.  Why is it, 
              them, that researchers have consistently found evidence of  congressional
              responsiveness given the relatively low levels of  information in the
              electorate?  The Ph.D. student addresses this  question arguing that while the
              electorate may be generally  uninformed, there are a variety of sub-population
              which devote  considerable attention to a relatively narrow range of issues.  
              The student tests the hypothesis in two ways:  1) by relying on  survey data
              provided by the National Senate Election Study; 2)  through a content analysis
              of major newspapers.  This study  promises to substantially enhance our
              understanding of the topic.
