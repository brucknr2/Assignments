Abstract    :
              9411762  Root       The 1994 BOC Priestley Conference will be held at Bucknell 
              University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, from June 24 through June  27, 1994. 
              This conference is a joint celebration between the Royal  Society of Chemistry
              (RSC) and the American Chemical Society (ACS).  In 1974 the 200th anniversary
              of Joseph Priestley's discovery of  oxygen was observed.  Since that time
              conferences have been held  every three years;  The first in 1977 in Leed, UK
              (Heterogeneous  Oxidation): the second in 1980 in Birmingham, UK (Oxygen and
              Life);  the third in 1983 in London (Oxygen and the Conversion of Future 
              Feedstocks); the fourth in 1986 in Leeds (Membranes in Gas  Separation and
              Enrichment); the fifth in 1989 in Birmingham  (Separation of Gases); and the
              sixth in 1992 in Paris, France (Role  of Oxygen in Improving Chemical
              Processes).       The basic theme of the 1994 conference will be "Oxidants and 
              Oxidation in the Earth's Atmosphere" with a keynote lecture on the  history of
              ozone.  Topics crucial to the atmospheric chemistry of  global change and local
              and regional air pollution will be  addressed.  Recent progress in these areas
              has been rapid.  As  detailed in Section 2, the Organizing Committee has
              assembled a  distinguished group of U.S. and international atmospheric chemists
               who will address the issues domination current research and policy  agendas. 
              The ACS and RSC feel it is important to communicate this  progress and to
              identify remaining scientific and societal  questions in a forum accessible to
              academic, industrial, and  government scientists, engineers, and policy-makers.
               This grant  will support the participation of graduate and post-doctoral 
              students in the conference.
