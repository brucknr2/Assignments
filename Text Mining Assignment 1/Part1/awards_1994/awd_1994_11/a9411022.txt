Abstract    :
              9411022  Weisner  This proposal from the Institute of Electrical and  Electronic
              Engineers, requests support to conduct a workshop  entitled "Industry 2000
              Workshop."    Industry 2000 will bring together leaders from industry, 
              academia, government, and professional societies to focus on  the appropriate
              development and delivery of career-long  education to professionals seeking to
              keep current in the  field.  The Workshop participants will grapple with 
              practical issues based on the experience of fellow  participants and their
              organizations.  How does industry  perceive the need for training, continuing
              education, and  professional development?  What makes sense in the short and 
              long term?  How can industry work with the various  providers, particularly
              universities, to develop more  accountability for dollars spent on professional
               development?  In addition to providing a forum where ideas  and resources can
              be shared, Industry 2000 will provide IEEE  with an opportunity to learn about
              industry needs first  hand.    Since this proposal is for conducting a
              workshop, it is  exempt from peer review in accordance with NSF Manual No.  10,
              Section 122.1-3.  Award of a grant is recommended.      Paul J. Herer
