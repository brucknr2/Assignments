Abstract    :
              9411161  Crowley   The patterns of organismal growth, development, and survival
              form in the context of ecological communities. But especially for animals with
              complex life cycles, causal linkages between life stages of the organism - and
              among organisms within populations and communities - are often difficult to
              establish and understand. In particular, the effects of predators feeding on
              both other predators and their prey (omnivory), and the role of intraspecific
              predation (cannibalism) clearly require additional attention.   The objectives
              of this proof of concept award are to (1) develop and evaluate laboratory and
              semifield methods for the Epitheca cynosura system, (2) construct the quonset
              array to assess feasibility of experiments, (3) initiate laboratory culture and
              develop semifield methods for the Ischnura verticalis system, and (4) locate
              pond systems for surveys of  population dynamics.  %%%   This project will
              directly contribute to development of life-history theory and to empirical
              testing of theory in an integrated, mutually stimulatory way. The proposed work
              will substantially enhance understanding of life history dynamics and its
              effects on population and community structure. Finally, this research will
              provide insight into how complex life cycles respond to their community
              context.
