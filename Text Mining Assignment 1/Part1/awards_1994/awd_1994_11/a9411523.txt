Abstract    :
              9411523  Elliot           ABSTRACT    Joint Arizona Center for Manufacturing
              Education and Training    Arizona State University, the University of Arizona,
              Northern Arizona University and seven high-tech industrial partners will create
              a Joint Center for Manufacturing Education and Training to meet the needs of
              industry for engineers with post-baccalaureate manufacturing education.  The
              comprehensive curriculum development process will rely heavily on engineers
              from industry to produce a product which is responsive to industrial needs and
              requirements.  Industrial partners will also participate in teaching of
              courses.  Using jointly-developed educational modules and a variety of delivery
              systems, the Center expects to reach at least 2,000 individuals, including
              unemployed, minority and women engineers, in the three year grant period. 
              Expanded outreach to minority populations will be provided through Northern
              Arizona University's connections with the Native American communities and the
              University of Arizona's relations with the Hispanic population.  ***
