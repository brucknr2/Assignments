Abstract    :
                This project, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, is  a
              preliminary exploration of autonomous cable-suspended mobile  manipulators and
              platforms.  While there has been some work on  automated cranes, there is a
              need to develop a systematic approach  to achieving a fundamental understanding
              of the dynamics of such a  setup, for potential uses in construction and other
              field robotics  settings, as well as in heavy manufacturing.  The problems are 
              nontrivial, and this initial exploration will help to develop a  convincing
              case for a full-scale research effort in the future.   The preliminary study
              will yield an experimental testbed and  preliminary results that should give
              the investigators a better  idea of what should be involved in a more
              systematic plan of attack  for developing position and orientation control of
              suspended  platforms.
