Abstract    :
              9411974  Hayden    The Virginia Coast Reserve (VCR) is a dynamic, frequently
              disturbed landscape.  The types of ecosystem changes that normally occur across
              large distances (continents, biomes) and over long periods of time (e.g.
              glacial and interglacial periods) happen on decadal time-scales.  As a result,
              ecosystem state changes are frequent.  The central research theme of the VCR
              LTER project is the understanding of the transitions among ecosystem states and
              succession within these states. Our approach will be to continue to study
              succession within several of the more prominent states (Myrica thickets,
              forests and salt marshes) and the response of these states to disturbance.  The
              parameters measured are those in the NSF-defined LTER network core areas.  In
              addition, we have implemented manipulative experiments by altering inundation
              patterns in marshes and altering the availability of fresh water to terrestrial
              vegetation on a barrier island.  The products of the proposed work will be the
              development of a new theoretical base for maintenance and structuring of 
              landscape, further elucidation of controls on ecosystem processes, and new
              ecosystem and landscape modeling approaches.
