Abstract    :
              9411203  Zhao       This award is for a planning grant to enable the principal  
              investigator to develop a program of research on the application of   genetic
              algorithms to the optimal design of engineering systems.    In particular, this
              research will focus on the design of complex   systems involving the synthesis
              of topology, geometry, component   properties, and their relationships.  The
              preliminary research will   study some important issues concerning the
              development of   methodologies for the above purpose, including the possible  
              representations of engineering systems suitable for genetic   algorithms, the
              representation of design requirements and   constraints, and possible
              extensions to other engineering problems   that involve the synthesis of a
              large number of subsystems and   components.       This research could lead to
              a better understanding of the   engineering design process, and the ability to
              affect better system   designs.  Although it is initially focused in the area
              of civil   structures, if successful, it should be applicable to a wide  
              variety of engineering systems.
