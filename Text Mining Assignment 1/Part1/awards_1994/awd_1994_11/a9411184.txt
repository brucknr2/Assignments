Abstract    :
              Understanding the mechanism of the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol   on
              platinum electrodes is important to the development of improved   methanol
              oxidation catalysts for use in fuel cells.  In this research   project,
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   submonolayer
              amounts of ruthenium deposited on a platinum electrode have   been found to
              significantly enhance the rate of electrocatalytic methanol   oxidation.  A
              combination of ultra high vacuum electron spectroscopic   methods and
              radio-labelling techniques will be used to investigate the   role of the
              structure of these ruthenium deposits in the methanol   oxidation catalysis.  A
              basic understanding of the mechanism of this   important catalytic system is
              likely to result from this work.    The correlation between the structure of
              submonolayer ruthenium deposits   on platinum electrodes, and their activity
              for the electrocatalytic   oxidation of methanol will be explored in this
              research project.    Structures and compositions of these submonolayer deposits
              will be   obtained by electron spectroscopic and radiochemical methods.  A more
                detailed understanding of this technologically important catalytic   reaction
              should ensue.
