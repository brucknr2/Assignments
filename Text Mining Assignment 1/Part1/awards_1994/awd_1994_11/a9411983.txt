Abstract    :
              9411983  Cuny   This award provides travel support for three career management
              workshops targeted at women who are new to academic careers in computer
              science.  The workshops will present practical information, advice, and basic
              information needed to succeed in academic careers.  The attendees will be
              provided with opportunities to interact with more senior women in academia, to
              develop mentoring relationships, and to start a professional network with their
              fellow attendees.  The workshops will be held in conjunction with the Grace
              Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing to be held in Virginia in June 1994,
              with Supercomputing '94 to be held in Washington DC in November 1994, and with
              the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) to be held most probably in
              Philadelphia in 1996.  A successful pilot workshop has already been held in
              conjunction with the first FCRC held in San Diego in May of 1993.  The workshop
              drew a 150 participants although funding was provided for only 32 people.  The
              CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian academic departments of Computer
              Science and Computer Engineering, and Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic
              computing research.  The mission of CRA is to represent and inform the
              computing research community and to support and promote its interests.  Dr.
              Weingarten is the Executive Director of CRA.  Dr. CUNY, the academic leader of
              this project, is a Professor of Computer Science and The University of Oregon.
