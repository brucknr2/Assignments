Abstract    :
              9411567  Kelley  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North 
              Carolina State University will purchase a Hewlett-Packard 3577B  Network
              Analyzer and an Apple Quadra 950 Computer.  The new  equipment will support
              ongoing power quality and efficiency  research funded by the Electric Power
              Research Center of North  Carolina State University.  Increasingly, the
              line-current and  line-voltage distortion produced by nonlinear loads reduces
              power  quality and creates unexpected high-frequency loss.  One project  the
              network analyzer will measure line impedance to find the  impact of
              line-current distortion on line-voltage distortion.  In  a second project the
              network analyzer will measure transformer  and motor impedance to find excess
              loss due to voltage and  current distortion.  The impedance measurements
              provide a better  understanding of power system operation with nonlinear loads
              and  are essential to maintain power quality and efficiency in the  presence of
              current and voltage distortion.  ***
