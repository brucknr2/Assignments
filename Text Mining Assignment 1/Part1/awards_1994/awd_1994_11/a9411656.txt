Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9411656  MIT  P.I.:  Karen Gleason      The Chemical Engineering
              Department at MIT requests support to purchase off-the-shelf components to
              upgrade an existing spectrometer with the capabilities to perform
              state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  In particular, support is
              requested for the purchase of a dynamic angle spinning NMR probe, a pulse
              programmer for generating shaped pulses, commercial software for setting-up NMR
              experiments and analyzing multi-dimensional NMR experiments, an amplifier and
              filter for deuterium spectroscopy and a superconducting magnet.  This
              including:    1) Study of the anisotropy of molecular organization induced by
              solventless process-   ing of thin films of poly(acrylate-co-acrylic acid)s and
              by fiber-spinning of high   performance liquid crystal aromatic polyesters. 
              (Prof. Gregory C. Rutledge)    2) Elucidation of deformation and toughening
              mechanisms in particle-modified nylon   copolymers and blends.  (Prof. Robert
              E. Cohen)    3) Quantification of photosensitive salt segregation within the
              polymeric matrices of    chemically amplified resists.  (Prof. Karen K.
              Gleason)    In addition, this equipment will support research on electronic,
              optical, and biological solids which is currently active within our department.
               These components will impart new advanced capabilities to and enhance the user
              friendliness of the existing radiofrequency system of a homebuilt spectrometer
              in order to create a productive multi-user instrument dedicated to engineering
              research on polymeric materials and other technologically significant solids.
