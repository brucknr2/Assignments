Abstract    :
              9411900  Garoff    Wetting of a surface by a fluid arises in many natural and 
              technical settings.  Despite its common occurrence, wetting is  neither
              completely understood nor entirely controllable in  technical processes.  The
              open scientific questions arise from the  sensitivity to the detailed physics
              and chemistry of the interfaces  involved.  Using optical, x-ray, and neutron
              techniques, the  Principal Investigators will investigate wetting phenomena on
              both  the macroscopic and microscopic scales.  The proposal seeks to 
              understand the origins of the complex, macroscopic wetting behavior  within the
              microscopic structures of fluids confined by the  interfaces at and near the
              contact line.    %  %  %  %    Wetting of a surface by a fluid arises in many
              natural and  technological settings such as recovery of fluid fossil fuels,
              film  coating, and the processing of advanced composite materials.   Despite
              its common occurrence, wetting is neither completely  understood nor entirely
              controllable in technical processes.  The  program will study the microscopic
              origins of wetting processes  using a variety of experimental techniques,
              including neutron and  x-rays scattering performed at national facilities. 
              Results of the  proposed research will add to the scientific basis needed for 
              engineering advanced materials and for other technological  processes dominated
              by wetting.  ***
