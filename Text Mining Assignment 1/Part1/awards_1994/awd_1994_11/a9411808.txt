Abstract    :
              9411808  Sork     Young secondary forests are becoming increasingly common and
              important throughout the tropics as primary forests are cleared and
              unproductive fields and pastures are abondoned.  However, the dynamics of tree
              regeneration in secondary forests have received very little research.  This
              study examines the ecology of tree seedling establishment in ten-year old
              secondary forest in Amazonian Peru.  The objectives are to: 1) examine intra-
              and interspecific patterns of growth and survivorship of protected seedlings,
              2) measure impact of exposure to physical damage from herbivores and litter
              fall on seedling performance, and 3) evaluate whether morphological traits of
              seeds and seedlings are predictive of performance.      This research will
              greatly improve our understanding of the processes of secondary forest
              regeneration.  The results of this study will have application in the
              conservation and restoration of tropical forest ecosystems.
