Abstract    :
              9411747  Younkin  The award is for the purchase of a tilting, open channel to 
              be used in studies of flows in channels with compounded  cross-sections and for
              experiments on the flow-induced  vibrations of gates and overflowing nappes. 
              Provisions will  be made for the installation of different highs, widths and 
              cross-slopes of symmetrical and asymmetrical flood plains of  various surface
              roughness, as well as for the installations  of hydraulic gates models.  The
              flume is designed to permit  the measurement of flow velocity distributions
              and, by  integration, the discharge in compound section channels over  a wide
              range of channel shapes and relative roughness.  The  flow-induced vibrations
              of hydraulic gates and oscillation  of the nappe will be examined as well with
              both over-and-  under-flow.  The equipment will be used by undergraduate and 
              graduate students working with faculty in research and  course projects
              providing them with an excellent research  experience.  ***
