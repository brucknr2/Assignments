Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Washington University  CTS-9411556  P. I.:  John Kardos      This
              Equipment Grant will support the acquisition of  a mechanical spectrometer
              which is to be used for taking data critical to a number of research projects. 
              Typical of the materials to be investigated are:  materials exhibiting complex
              reheolgical behavior, including polyimide- and epoxy-based composites, highly
              entangled polymers that exhibit processing instabilities, coacervates and
              slurries containing needle and platelet particles.  The use of the spectrometer
              will also be integrated into advanced polymer and composite processing and
              rheology courses.
