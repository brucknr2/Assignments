Abstract    :
                    This  is a project designed to develop a new class  of  loglinear and
              logit models for examining structural  effects  in  social  science  research. 
              Work on the  development  of  these  models will include efforts to examine the
              robustness  of  the  models and their ability to deal with  a  range  of 
              empirical phenomena.  The project will culminate in the  the  development of
              user-friendly computer software to  make  the  methods developed available to
              other researchers.        Loglinear and logistic models have been widely used
              in  recent  years by sociologists and others to study  phenomena  which  
              cannot  be  represented  accurately  by   continuous  variables.  Existing
              versions of these models suffer from  a  number  of  assumptions and
              restrictions  that  limit  their  utility in social science research.  By
              developing a new and  broader range of such models and preparing computer
              software  to  make  the  newly  developed models  available  to  other 
              researchers,   this   project   will   make   an   important  contribution  to
              sociological research on a  wide  range  of  topics.
