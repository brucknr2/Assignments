Abstract    :
              94111478  Marx  This Dissertation Improvement research investigates the 
              globalization of the police function in German society from the  middle of the
              19th to the early 20th century.  This study  examines from a sociological
              perspective the changing nature of  police globalization from the first formal
              police cooperation  initiative with German involvement in 1851 until the Nazi
              take-  over of the International Criminal Police Commission in 1938.   The
              analysis seeks to uncover the forms and intensity of the  global dimensions of
              policing in Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna and  Strasbourg.  Primary and secondary
              documents will be analyzed  using historical research methods.  Primary
              documents consist of  police reports in state and police archives in specified
              regions.   Secondary data include studies on the history of policing and the 
              identified societal dimensions.  This research seeks to advance  knowledge on
              the emergence and basic patterns of the  globalization of policing, and to
              interpret the nature of police  globalization in relation to changing
              historical conditions.
