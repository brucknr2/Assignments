Abstract    :
                          9411829  Shapiro, Lynda P.  This project, conducted by the Oregon
              Institute of Marine  Biology, will provide for institutional planning
              activities.  The facility has undergone a recent expansion, resulting in  a
              doubling of resident faculty, an even greater increase in  support staff, and a
              four-fold increase in active research  programs.  The expansion has also
              resulted in augmentation  of graduate program, and increased use of laboratory 
              facilities by visitors.  The increase in active, funded  research programs has
              carried with it an increase need for  reliability in support of these programs.
                 Specifically, the project will aim to develop a logical Long-  Range
              Planning Document that will allow the institution to  plan and articulate a
              program based on new and innovative  ways to support and promote research and
              education.  The  Document will guide future growth, and allow the use of 
              existing space more efficiently and appropriately relative  to plans for
              growth.  There will be two inter-related  aspects:    1)  As a prerequisite to
              long-range facilities planning,  faculty and staff, with the aid of a
              Facilitator, will  develop a long-range Plan for Research and Education at 
              OIMB.  This plan will articulate the needs and expectations  of new faculty,
              and will document a guideline for future  growth.    2)  The Facilities Plan
              will be based on a thorough study of  present needs and future plans, and
              architectural studies of  all buildings.  The product will be recommendations
              for more  efficient use of space and further recommendations based on  improved
              laboratory safety and access, with cost estimates  and prioritization of
              recommendations.
