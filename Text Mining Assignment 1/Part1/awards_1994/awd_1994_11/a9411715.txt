Abstract    :
              9411715  Dutta       This award will purchase a layered manufacturing machine
              which  will be dedicated to support research in engineering.  The  equipment
              will be used for Project MAXWELL, a research project in  the area of discrete
              part design and manufacturing.  It aims at  bringing together two of the latest
              developments, one in design and  the other in manufacturing, for the
              realization of efficient  structural and mechanical components.  The practical
              goal of the  project is the verification of a methodology for the design and 
              fabrication of parts that are highly efficient in terms of reduced  weight and
              increased structural performance.       The project is based on the
              homogenization design technique  for designing the shape and material
              composition of structures and  structural components based only on a
              description of loading  conditions and packaging requirements.  Such designs
              often possess  complex geometries and microstructures.  A layered manufacturing
               machine for the fabrication of such parts will be acquired. Under  project
              MAXWELL, structural parts will be designed (both for form  and materials
              composition), fabricated, and tested in an integrated  manner.
