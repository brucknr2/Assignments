Abstract    :
              9411573  Graumlich   Concern of the possible ecological consequences of
              trace-gas induced climatic change has led to examinations of how past variation
              in climate has influenced community structure and composition. Of particular
              interest is the paleoecological history of ecotonal boundaries, where species
              are expected to respond sensitively and predictably to climate change. The
              elevational position of alpine treeline in the southern Sierra Nevada has
              shifted over the past several millennia; dead and sub-fossil wood, up to
              several thousand years old, remains preserved at elevations of up to 80 m
              higher than present treeline. Previous research has demonstrated that the wood
              is dateable using dendrochronological methods, providing a temporarily precise
              record of ecotonal shifts over the last three millennia. This research will use
              this wealth of paleoecological information to analyze the role of climate in
              driving past movements of alpine treeline in the southern Sierra Nevada.
              Long-term records (>1000 yr) of seasonal climate fluctuations will be compared
              with records of treeline movement. Using the technique of stand
              reconstructions, this study will also investigate how climate variation over
              the last millennium has affected rates of recruitment and mortality in
              subalpine forests.   %%%  Results from this dissertation research will allow
              quantification of the time-varying relationship between climate and treeline,
              and exploration of how this relationship is mediated through climatic effects
              on rates of population processes in subalpine forests.
