Abstract    :
                  9411387  Feng  Experimental research of new optical fiber sensors for
              monitoring  civil infrastructure systems is planned.  Optical sensors employ a 
              vibrating wire whose tension can be modulated by external force,  strain, or
              vibration and is translated into the change in the wire  vibration frequency. 
              The wire vibration frequency is detected by  light sent to and reflected from
              the wire through an optical fiber  cable.  Compared to other existing optical
              fiber sensors which tend  to suffer from the lack of reliability and
              robustness, the sensors  have two significant advantages: one is that the
              sensing head is a  vibrating wire (rather than an optical fiber), which can
              sense a  specific physical quantity without interference from miscellaneous 
              effects: the other is that the wire vibration is a well understood  physical
              phenomenon.  In fact, with a high level of reliability,  its frequency is
              optically measured and transmitted to recording  and other devices through the
              optical fiber without attenuation or  distortion.  These advantages should make
              the sensor system simple,  reliable and robust, and hence more readily
              deployable in civil  infrastructure applications.
