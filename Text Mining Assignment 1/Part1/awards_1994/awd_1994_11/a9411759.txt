Abstract    :
              9411759  Hawkins  During the devasting Northridge earthquake in January 1994, 
              unexpected damage occurred to many parking garages of various  prestressed
              construction types.  Such damage revealed serious  questions as to the design
              adequacy in terms of gravity as well  as lateral load-resistance of such
              structures.  Important  engineering lessons could be learned from studying the
              earthquake  response or damage data collected from post-event field 
              investigations.    The Principal investigator, with assistance provided by the 
              prestressed/precast concrete industry and trade association,  conducted a
              comprehensive field investigation and has collected a  rather complete set of
              relevant data/information pertaining to  parking garage structures and their
              damage.  This project will  enable an indepth study to be carried out to
              address some of the  critical issues as follows:  (1) to determine reasons for 
              observed damages and identify common features, (2) to determine  seismic risk
              to existing garages and (3) to recommend necessary  building code changes.   
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research project is supported,  due to the
              importance of the anticipated learning, as a part of  the National Earthquake
              Hazards Reduction Program's Post-  earthquake investigation activity.  ***
