Abstract    :
              9411950  Bull       This experimental study examines molecular evolution in 
              recombinant DNA phages.  The recombinant phage are constructed to  specifically
              address two topics of interest in molecular evolution:  1) the molecular
              evolution of essential transgenes (phage capsid  and assembly genes) and 2) the
              evolution of RNA polymerase-promoter  interactions.  Transgenic phage will be
              characterized at the  molecular level via sequence analysis and at the
              phenotypic level  via fitness levels.  The fitness of transgenic phage is
              initially  low, but increases rapidly when subjected to laboratory natural 
              selections via serial propagation.  After a response to selection  for
              increased fitness is observed, the phage will be re-  characterized at the
              molecular and phenotypic levels.  Initial  genetic manipulations will lead to
              specific expectations as to  which genetic elements should evolve and how they
              will change over  the course of evolution.       This system of experimental
              molecular evolution in  bacteriophage is a powerful new approach in
              evolutionary biology.   Transgenic organisms have become increasingly popular
              in many areas  of biology and industry.  This project will for the first time 
              directly address questions concerning how transgenes evolve, what  their
              effects are on other genes, and how these combined molecular  changes affect
              evolution of fitness at the organismal level.
