Abstract    :
              9411477  Faber    It is the intent of this proposed work to examine a novel
              approach  to toughening single phase materials without second phase addition 
              by creation of "single phase laminates."  The prototype material  for study is
              iron titanate with an exceedingly low thermal  expansion coefficient along one
              of its axes.  Textures in the  ceramics can be developed through magnetic field
              assisted  techniques.  The studies proposed consists of fundamental fracture 
              studies of iron titanate, both random and textured, monolithic and  laminated,
              to gain an understanding microstructure-processing  relationships.  Small angle
              microcracking in situ.  Finally the  design criteria will be established for
              tough, single phase  ceramics through laminated microstructures.    %%%    The
              proposed work will examine a novel approach to toughening  single phase
              materials iron titanate without second phase addition.   The textured material
              will be processed with the assistance of  magnetic field processing.  An
              understanding of microstructure-  processing relationship and the design
              criteria for tough, single  phase ceramic through laminated microstructure will
              be established.  ***
