Abstract    :
              IBN 94-11278  Winkler & Freeman                              ABSTRACT    The
              choice of a mate is one of the most important decisions  an animal makes.  A
              high-quality mate can provide better  care and higher biological quality for
              the offspring.  In  his doctoral dissertation research, Mr. Corey R. Freeman 
              will explore the dynamics of these decisions by testing the  effects of
              different amounts of male parental care on the  mating preferences of females. 
              He will use a combination of  field observations, experimental interventions
              and DNA  fingerprinting to add to our understanding of this important  aspect
              of the biology of social systems.
