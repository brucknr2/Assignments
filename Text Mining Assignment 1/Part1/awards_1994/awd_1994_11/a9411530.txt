              9411530  Wolcott  Texas Research and Technology Foundation, University of 
              Texas, Pan American and San Antonio, and Biomedical  Enterprises have joined
              together to improve manufacturing  engineering and management education in
              South Texas.  The  proposed program includes new courses, new lab equipment, 
              internships for both faculty and students at firms, and  visiting lecturers
              from industry.  UT Pan American offered  the first B.S. in manufacturing
              education in Texas and about  85% of its students are Hispanic.
