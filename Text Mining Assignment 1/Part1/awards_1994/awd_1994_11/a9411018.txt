Abstract    :
              9411018  Figueroa  The recent Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, CA generated
               extensive damage to buildings, roadway, bridges, and other civil  engineering
              works and structures.  News reports and  communications from researchers
              indicated the evidence of  liquefaction at several locations.  Researchers have
              attempted to  determine the parameters which could better define the 
              liquefaction potential of a soil deposit and handle random  loading during the
              past two decades.  Seed and Idriss among  others, proposed a general method for
              evaluating the liquefaction  potential of a soil deposit using various
              parameters  representative of the deposit, and the magnitude of the expected 
              earthquake and the shear stresses induced by the design  earthquake.  More
              recently, Figueroa, Saada et al. in a project  funded by NSF, established a
              relationship between the unit energy  imparted to the soil up to liquefaction
              and the effective  confining pressure, relative density and shear strain
              amplitude  for a sand.  These findings set the basis for the development of  a
              new method for evaluating the liquefaction potential of a soil  deposit using
              the unit energy approach.  Liquefaction observed  during the Northridge
              earthquake offers the great opportunity to  initiate the validation of this new
              method of liquefaction  potential evaluation through the torsional shear
              testing of soils  representative of locations which experienced this
              phenomenon,  and the analysis of earthquake records.  ***
