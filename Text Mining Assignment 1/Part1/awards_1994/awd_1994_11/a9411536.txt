Abstract    :
              9411536  Jansen       The use of DNA data in studying the phylogenetic or 
              genealogical relationships among organisms has increased  dramatically over the
              last few years.  For most plant groups, the  focus, for several methodological
              reasons, has been upon organellar  DNA from the leaf chloroplast. 
              Consequently, a major question is  posed concerning whether mutational
              differences in chloroplast DNA  are strongly correlated with mutational
              differences between plant  species in their nuclear DNA, which is usually more
              difficult to  analyze.  Graduate student Dennis Loockerman, under the
              supervision  of faculty adviser Robert Jansen at the University of Texas, is 
              addressing this question in his study of a large group of sunflower  relatives,
              the Tageteae.  He will be analyzing large amounts of  data from both
              chloroplast and nuclear DNA sets, comparing patterns  of mutational differences
              among species, and reconstructing  phylogenetic trees for this group of
              flowering plants.  Results  from the molecular studies will be integrated with
              traditional  morphological characters, to improve classification of these
              plants  and designate reliable identification features.       Analysis of DNA
              data from both organellar and nuclear sources  in a large group of sunflower
              relatives, the Tageteae, and  integration with morphological characters, will
              improve taxonomic  and phylogenetic understanding of these plants.
