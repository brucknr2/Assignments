Abstract    :
                    This  is a study of the impact of the ejido reform  in  rural  Mexico.  
              That  reform,  initiated  in  1991-92,   is  designed  to  make  possible the
              eventual  privatization  of  lands   that  were  formerly  held  communally  by
                Mexican  cultivators.   The project will be conducted  through  pilot 
              research  in  the  Zamora Valley, Michoac n,  Mexico.   This  project is funded
              through NSF's program of Research Planning  Grants for Women Scientists and
              Engineers.        Communally  held  land has been  a  basic  feature  of 
              agrarian  Mexico  since the time of the Mexican  revolution.  Critics  of the
              ejido system claim that it hinders  economic  development; defenders of the
              system argue that its  erosion  will lead to increased inequality and
              landlessness.  A study  of  the reform from its early stages will throw light
              on the  merits  of such opposing arguments.  It will also illuminate  the 
              impact  of  this important reform  on  the  social  and  economic  lives of
              Mexican farmers and on Mexico's political  stability   and   links   to  the  
              world   economy.    Land  privatization  reforms have been proposed or tried 
              in  many  other  parts  of the world, and the Mexican experience  will 
              contribute  to  growing  scientific  understanding  of   the  consequences of
              such reforms.  In addition to its scientific  and  practical importance, this
              grant will enable a talented  young  researcher  to conduct pilot research  to 
              prepare  a  request for funding for a larger project.
