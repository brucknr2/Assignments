Abstract    :
              9411138  Rivera  This project is on research to develop a general on-line 
              optimization method to improve ion-exchange chromatographic  separations.  Two
              optimization methodologies, the Doehlert design  and the simplex method, are
              compared in their ability to maximize  productivity and resolve constituent
              peaks.  Operating parameters  such as pH, mobile phase flow rate and
              composition, sample size,  and gradient length will be investigated for their
              influence on  separation performance for mixtures of commercially available 
              proteins.  Also, an on-line peak tracking procedure based on  neural networks
              will be investigated.  ***
