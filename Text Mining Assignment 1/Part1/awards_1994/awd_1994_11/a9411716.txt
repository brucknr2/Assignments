Abstract    :
              Abstract - Brennecke - 9411716    This is an equipment grant to enable the
              Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Notre Dame to purchase a
              Time Resolved Fluorescence Spectrometer which will be dedicated to support
              research in engineering.  Initially, the equipment will be used to study
              solvation and reactivity in supercritical fluids (SCFs), specifically: (1) use
              of SCFs to study reversible diffusion-influenced reactions; (2) study of the
              transition of diffusion-controlled reactions from Stokes-Einstein diffusion in
              liquids in kinetic theory and (3) use of fluorescence probes to study
              preferential solvation in SCF mixtures.  SCFs have found a variety of
              applications in extractions and separations because of their unique physical
              properties that can be varied between those of normal gases and liquids.  They
              also show potential for use as solvents for reactions; for example, the use of
              supercritical water to oxidize hazardous organic wastes.  The above projects
              are important in advancing those technologies because they involve the
              application of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques to study fundamental
              quantities, such as the solvation of species and the solvent effect on reaction
              rates.  The understanding gained from these experiments will aid in predicting
              what reaction could benefit from operation at supercritical conditions.
