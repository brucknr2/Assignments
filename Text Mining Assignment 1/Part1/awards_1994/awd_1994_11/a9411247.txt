Abstract    :
              9411247  Kaufman                                 ABSTRACT         This project
              will advance the comparative study of Mixe-Zoquean  (MZ) languages, mainly
              through expanding the number of texts and the  amount of lexical data on most
              of these languages: almost all lack  adequate documentation in both of these
              areas. Due to the structure of  the field situation, we expect this project to
              lead to the development  of a network of scholars working on both descriptive
              and historical  issues in MZ languages -- something that has been need for
              quite some  time. Most of the grant funds are in support of field work to
              recover  new information on the modern MZ languages. Some of the funding is 
              devoted to epi-Olmec decipherment research (in which the principal 
              investigators have made the major breakthroughs), since the  interpretation of
              two intact epi-Olmec texts is making significant  contributions to MZ
              comparative linguistics. The work is significant in  several areas. MZ
              languages have grammatical properties of interest to  current linguistic
              theory. It has the potential to make a major  contribution to early
              Mesoamerican cultural and linguistic history; MZ  languages were spoken by the
              Olmecs, and were influential at the Olmec  era and subsequently in affecting
              many other languages in the area. It  contributes to the ongoing decipherment
              of epi-Olmec writing; the  interpretation of its texts depends heavily upon MZ
              comparative studies,  which were crucial in the original decipherment. Finally,
              it includes a  major language salvage operation, helping to preserve an
              important part  of the linguistic heritage of the Americas.  ***
