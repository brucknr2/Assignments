Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the design, development, and  evaluation of a
              distributed digital library - the Alexandria  Project - of spatially-indexed
              information that includes  collections of maps and images digital form.  The
              goal of the  Alexandria Project is a distributed testbed that provides 
              geographically dispersed users with access to a geographically  dispersed set
              of library collections.  Users will be able to  access, browse and retrieve
              specific items form the collections of  the library by means of user-friendly
              interfaces that integrate  visually-based and text-based query languages. 
              Librarians will be  provided with facilities that enable them to extend their 
              collections of appropriately formatted materials and to add meta-  information
              to their electronic catalogue.
