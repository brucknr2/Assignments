Abstract    :
              This project - the Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project  (SIDLP) - is to
              develop the enabling technologies for a single,  integrated and "universal"
              library, proving uniform access to the  large number of emerging networked
              information sources and  collections.  These include both on-line versions of
              pre-existing  works and new works and media of all kinds that will be available
               on the globally interlinked computer networks of the future.  The  Integrated
              Digital Library is broadly defined to include everything  from personal
              information collections, to the collections that one  finds today in
              conventional libraries, to the large data  collections shared by scientists. 
              The technology developed in this  project will provide the "glue" that will
              make this worldwide  collection usable as a unified entity, in a scalable and 
              economically viable fashion.
