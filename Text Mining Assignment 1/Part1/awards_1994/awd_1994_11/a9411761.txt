Abstract    :
              9411761  Balsley          In this project the researchers plan to extend the 
              capabilities of state-of-the-art kite technology for atmospheric  sampling and
              related research.  The workplan will accomplish this  feasibility experiment by
              (1) increasing the current maximum  attainable height from around 3 km to over
              13-14 km, and by (2)  using the tethered kite as a "sky hook" to enable a small
              device (a  "WindTRAM") to travel up and down the kite tether to obtain high- 
              resolution profiles of ozone, temperature, pressure, and humidity.   If
              successful, the project results will be a unique and inexpensive  technique to
              study vertical profiles of critical atmospheric  species throughout the entire
              troposphere and possibly the lower  stratosphere.
