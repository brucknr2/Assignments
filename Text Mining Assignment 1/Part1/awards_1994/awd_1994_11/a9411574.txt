Abstract    :
              9411574  Wen  This theoretical research will deal with strongly correlated 
              electron systems, one of the most important current problems in  condensed
              matter physics.  Strongly correlated electron systems  include high temperature
              superconductors, fractional quantum Hall  systems and mesoscopic devices. 
              Research will be conducted on a  variety of topics including: (1) the noise
              spectrum of tunneling  and transport of correlated electron systems in
              mesoscopic devices.   Better understanding of noise spectrum will increase our
              knowledge  of the response of mesoscopic devices at high frequencies.  The 
              noise spectrum is also a powerful probe of correlation dynamics.  (2) the
              relation between the fractional quantum Hall effect and the  dirty boson
              problem will be studied. (3) studies will be conducted  on the new class of
              non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states.   (4) in strongly correlated metals
              slow spin fluctuations in high  temperature superconductors will be compared to
              slow density  fluctuations in the fractional quantum Hall effect.  In
              particular,  the interaction between electrons and slow fluctuations yields 
              Cherenkov radiation.  A theory of this Cherenkov radiation will be  developed
              for these strongly correlated metals.  %%%  Theoretical research will be
              conducted on a variety of topics  dealing with strongly correlated electron
              systems.  These systems  are one of the most challenging problems in
              contemporary physics.   Topics include the high temperature superconductors and
              the  fractional quantum Hall effect.  ***
