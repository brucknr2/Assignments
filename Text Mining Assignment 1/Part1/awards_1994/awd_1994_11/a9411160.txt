Abstract    :
              This project will compile an extensive dictionary of Musey, a  Chadic language
              of northern Cameroon and southwestern Chad. The  dictionary will provide the
              first comprehensive lexical study of  the language and of any language within
              the Masa group of Chadic  languages. The Musey-English dictionary will have at
              least 7500  main entries with lexical and grammatical information as well as 
              illustrative sentences for each entry. An accompanying grammar  sketch will
              provide additional information on this under studied  language. The main
              section of the dictionary will be supplemented  by English-Musey and
              French-Musey indices. The dictionary will be  a valuable resource to general
              linguists, general Africanists,  and scholars engaged in linguistic and other
              types of research in  the Lake Chad Basin.
