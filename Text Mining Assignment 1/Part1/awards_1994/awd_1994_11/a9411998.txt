Abstract    :
              9411998  Gordon  The primary goal of this research is to estimate the full cost
              of  business interruptions associated with the Northridge earthquake,  the
              first moderate to large earthquake with an epicenter inside a  large
              metropolitan area since the Long Beach earthquake of 1933.  Little research has
              been conducted on the business interruption  effects of a major earthquake as
              opposed to damage estimates to  structures and lifelines.  This is the first
              opportunity, then,  to undertake an ex-post analysis if business interruptions 
              resulting from a major urban earthquake.  Since it involves the  collection of
              perishable data, this project is being funded under  NSF's Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research program.  ***
