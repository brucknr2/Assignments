Abstract    :
              9411036  Redd  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design  Projects
              Program category, and requests support for  undergraduate and graduate student
              engineers to provide  prototype "custom designed" devices and software to aid 
              persons with disabilities.  The primary goal of this thrust  is to provide
              meaningful design experience for the  engineering student that will directly
              aid a specific  disabled individual. A formal program is in place at Utah 
              State University which will ensure satisfactory progress is  attained on these
              projects.  A group of students and the  investigators on the grant will work
              with a number of  collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects. 
              Forty projects are planned during the five year duration of  this award, and a
              written report on the completed projects  will be submitted for an annual
              publication.  Once  completed, each project will be given to the person for
              whom  it is designed.  The hope is that this "real world"  experience will give
              engineering students a sense of purpose  and pride, help engineering schools
              serve the community,  attract new students into engineering, and raise student 
              interest in graduate education.    This type of undertaking is important since
              it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students as part of  their
              undergraduate design requirements, and will also  benefit a population where
              customization is often needed for  rehabilitation devices.  ***
