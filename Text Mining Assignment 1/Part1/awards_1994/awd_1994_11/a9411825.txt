Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9411825  Kristen A. Fichthorn    A state-of-the-art high-speed
              RISC computer workstation is acquired.  This is to be used for research in
              computational statistical mechanics, morphological evolution in metal thin-film
              growth, dynamics of molecules on surfaces, and the influence of stress on
              metals.
