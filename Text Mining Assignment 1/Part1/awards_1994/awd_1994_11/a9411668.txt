Abstract    :
              9411668  Headrick  The Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source(CHESS) and the
              School of Engineering and Applied Physics and Cornell University will construct
              a Semiconductor Thin Film Growth/X-ray Diffraction System dedicated to support
              research in thin film microstructures.  Specifically, this equipment will
              support several new and existing research programs studying the growth o thin
              films of wide bandgap III-V materials using Gas Source Molecular Beam Epitaxy
              (GSMBE), Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE), and other new proposed growth techniques
              using ion, radical and molecular sources.  By utilizing the high intensity
              x-ray bams available and CHESS, this system will be able to perform time
              resolved measurements of the structure of semiconductor thin films during
              growth.  This research studying time-dependent effects is expected to yield
              critical insight in the development of advanced growth techniques and new
              microscopically structured materials.  Such structures are needed for
              electronic devices, optoelectronic devices, optical storage media, protective
              coatings and UV-transmitting windows based on the III-V nitrides, i.e. AIN, GaN
              and InN.  ***
