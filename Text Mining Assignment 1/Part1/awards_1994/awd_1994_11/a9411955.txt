Abstract    :
              The proposal is for the acquisition of an injection-seeded ND:YAG laser that
              will be used in two types of experiments.  The first is a "filtered" Rayleigh
              measurement which can be combined with simultaneous Raman spectroscopy to
              obtain both temperatures and concentrations.  The second application is for
              laser-induced incandescence, a technique recently promoted at Penn State.  The
              equipment will be used in several projects including combustion studies
              conducted in well-stirred reactors, turbulent and laminar diffusion flames, and
              Diesel engine and rocket chambers.
