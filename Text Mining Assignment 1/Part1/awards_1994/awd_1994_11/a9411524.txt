Abstract    :
              9411524  Diehl           ABSTRACT    Regional Center for Work Force Education   
              The State University of New York, Farmingdale, in conjunction with SUNY Small
              Business Development Center, area industries and the New York Network is
              proposing an ambitious, well-thought-out program to establish a regional center
              for work force education.  The proposal features video conferencing, television
              production, and distance learning in innovative ways.  There is a strong
              commitment and focus on factory floor education.  The participants plan to
              train 1500 individuals per year.  Pilot efforts to date for this program have
              attracted strong industry participation and financial support.  ***
