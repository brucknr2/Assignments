Abstract    :
              9411399  Mandrekar    The objective of the Congress is to recall the legacy of
              Norbert Wiener  and record its continuation in ongoing research. The legacy
              comprises  first the idealization of Einstein's theory of Brownian motion. 
              Wiener's work in this context constitutes the foundation of the  stochastic
              integration, stochastic differential equations, and  integration on
              infinite-dimensional spaces.. These three major fields  in probability have
              significant applications to engineering, control  theory, finance, and quantum
              physics. The legacy also includes Wiener's  work on generalized harmonic
              analysis, which has had numerous  ramifications, the most recent being the
              theory of wavelets, which in  turn is being used in the statistical application
              for the storage of  data. In addition, the legacy comprises the notions of
              capacity and  generalized solution of the Dirichlet problem, which in the
              1990's has  received a beautiful extension to nonlinear PDE's of order p > 1. 
              Probabilistic ideas of Norbert Wiener have led to the solu ions of  fundamental
              problems of Potential Theory and Harmonic Analysis.  These areas are being
              actively pursued today and the Congress will  strive to inspire young
              probabilists and analysts to continue Wiener's  work in his innovative way.
