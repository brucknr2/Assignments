Abstract    :
                          9411005  Beuth  This Research Initiation Award is to study residual
              stresses that  exist in products built by the successive application of molten 
              layers of material.  This process offers many competitive  advantages over
              other methods of manufacturing for some products  that are produced in small
              numbers.  The research will attack two  of the problems that are limiting the
              application of this  technique; namely, warping of the product via residual
              stresses and  stress driven delamination.  Progress in refining the shape 
              deposition manufacturing process is dependent upon results from  research such
              as that contained in this project.  ***
