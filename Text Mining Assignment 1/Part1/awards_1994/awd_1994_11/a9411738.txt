Abstract    :
              9411738  Lawrence  This project is to update the equipment utilized to control 
              experiments and collect data in the Structural Research  Laboratory of the
              Department of Civil engineering of the  University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaign.  This involves  (a) conversion frame analog to digital
              control (b)  acquisition of a long-stroke ram and of transducer signal- 
              conditioning equipment. The Structural Research Lab at  University of Illinois
              is used for testing structures and  their elements subjected to fluctuating
              loads such as  earthquakes, wind, waves and traffic loads.    This is a
              Northridge earthquake project.  ***
