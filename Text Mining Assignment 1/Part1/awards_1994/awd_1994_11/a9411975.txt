Abstract    :
              9411975  Foster    Forest ecosystems worldwide are changing in response to
              direct and indirect human activities.  These present a significant challenge
              requiring interpretation of the driving variables across wide temporal and
              spatial scales.  These dynamics also present an opportunity to evaluate the
              mechanisms regulating ecosystem responses.  Harvard Forest LTER I assessed
              temperate forest response to human (atmospheric deposition and climate change)
              and natural (wind damage) disturbances.  The research was structured around
              five primary areas: (1) retrospective studies of long-term changes in forest
              composition, disturbance, and environment; (2) studies of current forest
              conditions, (3) experimental manipulations to evaluate forest response to
              disturbance, (4) modeling studies of responses to disturbance over a range of
              temporal and spatial scales; and (5) cross-site studies.  Results from LTER I
              have transformed  understanding of forest response to disturbance and have
              emphasized the importance of integrated studies across time, space and
              discipline.  In particular, results document that temperate forests must be
              interpreted in the context of past disturbance, particularly land-use.  LTER II
               research is focused on the study of  legacies of  human land-use on modern
              regional scale forest processes.  Studies will continue to emphasize keystone
              long-term experiments and measurements with a focus on the five LTER core
              areas.  New studies will  (1) strengthen the temporal and spatial resolution;
              (2) evaluate population responses to disturbance and patterns of species
              distribution; (3) assess human-induced alteration of ecosystem function,
              especially C and N dynamics; (4) evaluate controls on C exchange at leaf  to
              stand levels; and (5) synthesize our work across scales through continued
              modeling, inter-site, and comparative studies.
