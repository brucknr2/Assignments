Abstract    :
                   This project is an investigation of the genetic structure of  life history
              variation among highly variable populations of the  mountain dusky salamander
              that lives throughout the Appalachian  Mountains.  Within discrete mountain
              systems, strong predictable  clines in a suite of life history traits are
              evident, and  phenotypic patterns contrast with the geographic structure 
              suggested by allozyme and ethological traits.  The proposed work is  to use
              mtDNA RFLPS as characters in phylogenetic reconstruction  analyses to elucidate
              the genetic history of these populations.       Knowledge of the genetic
              diversity of groups such as these may  help in better management and
              conservation practices in the  Southern Appalachians.
