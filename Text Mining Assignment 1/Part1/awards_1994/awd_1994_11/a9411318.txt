Abstract    :
                    This project constructs a digital library testbed and pursues  fundamental
              research addressing the scalable organization of large  digital collections. 
              The testbed contains a digital collection  containing journals and magazines in
              the engineering literature in  structured SGML format plus pictorial materials
              obtained from  commercial and professional publishers.  The associated
              information  systems initially centers about NCSA Mosaic for document display 
              and network access of other resources.  Basic research encompasses  both
              technical and social aspects of the testbed capabilities,  usage and usage
              patters including:  sociological analysis  (including ethnographic observation,
              surveys and other  instruments); economics research over a range of issues.  A
              general  goal of the efforts is to enable the design and analysis for  digital
              libraries infrastructure capable of scaling to very large  systems.
