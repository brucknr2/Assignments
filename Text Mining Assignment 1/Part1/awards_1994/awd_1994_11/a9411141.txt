Abstract    :
              9411141 Was  The objective of this work is to explore the use of ion beam
              assisted deposition (IBAD) to control the microstructure and interface
              properties of microlaminates.  The results should provide a more fundamental
              understanding of factors controlling strength and toughness in these systems. 
              Niobium/alumina is selected as the model, high temperature system to explore
              IBAD's effect on grain size, morphology, texture and ensuing strength of the
              ductile layer.  It may be possible to control the metal-oxide interface
              strength by controlling the orientation relationship and the impurity
              composition at the interface.  Although the depositions are done at high
              temperature (600 degrees C) and still higher temperature annealing is conducted
              to assess microstructural stability, the focus of the mechanical properties
              study is the toughness of the microlaminate at ambient temperature.   %%% The
              scientific approach is based on the idea that ion beam assisted deposition
              provides improved control over the structure of individual lamellae and
              interfaces in microlaminates, thereby improving the toughness and strength of
              these materials for high temperature applications as structural and coating
              materials. ***
