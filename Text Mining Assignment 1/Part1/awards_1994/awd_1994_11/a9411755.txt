Abstract    :
                   This is a study of downsizing in the Russian military, part of a larger
              comparative project to survey the social consequences of reduction in military
              manpower in both the United States and Russia.  An interview questionnaire will
              be administered to 1,800 officers in the Russian Army, 1,200 of whom are about
              to be separated from military service due to downsizing, and to their
              approximately 1,440 spouses.  The Russian officer sample will be drawn randomly
              from military populations at and around bases that are closing and bases that
              are remaining open.  Topics to be covered in the interview include prior work
              history, reemployment plans, financial hardships experienced, and such
              potential consequences of downsizing as depression, drinking problems, and
              family conflict.  The spouse survey will ask questions both about the spouse's
              own reactions to the transition and about how the solider is coping with the
              process.  %%%   This study takes advantage of an historic opportunity to study
              disruption in the life course of soldiers and their spouses whose livelihood
              and community status are threatened by loss of military employment.  Not only
              will the results contribute to several branches of the social and behavioral
              sciences, but the knowledge gained will be helpful to the governments of Russia
              and the United States as they attempt in partnership with each other to reduce
              the size of their military establishments and create a safer and more peaceful
              world.
