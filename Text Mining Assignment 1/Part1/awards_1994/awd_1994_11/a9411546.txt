Abstract    :
              9411546  Goldberg       Research in theoretical particle physics includes a 
              continuing study into the dynamics driving the evolution of the  early
              universe, and the origins of the fluctuations observed in  the cosmic microwave
              background radiation.  A second project  examines the links between this
              dynamics and rare decay processes  that can be observed in the laboratory. 
              Such links can provide  important checks on our current understanding about the
              early  universe.  ***
