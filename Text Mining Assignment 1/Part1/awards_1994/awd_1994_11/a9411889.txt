Abstract    :
              9411889  SCHEPPELE    The late 20th century is witnessing one of the most
              revolutionary  but peaceful political transformations in history, the
              transition  from regimes of state socialism to regimes characterized by 
              pluralism, democratic institutions, and the rule of law.  This  research
              project examines the creation of the rule of law in  Hungary, which has moved
              farthest along the path toward creating  a state where a written constitution
              meaningfully constrains and  guides day-to-day politics.  At the center of this
              transition in  Hungary is the powerful Constitutional Court which has already 
              acted aggressively to uphold a strong vision of human rights,  separation of
              powers, and constitutional regularity.  Acting on  the basis of petitions from
              ordinary citizens, the Constitutional  Court has struck down many statutes
              since 1990 on constitutional  grounds; the Parliament has re-worked most of
              these to comply  with the Court's interpretation of the Constitution.  Analysis
              of  the development and legitimation of this Court will make a major 
              contribution to our knowledge of the role of constitutionalism in  the
              democratization process.    The PI will be examining petitions to the Court
              from January 1990  to see what it is that ordinary citizens in this new
              democracy  believe a Constitution should do.  The analysis will include what 
              the Court does with these petitions, how they are turned into  constitutional
              questions, and the effects of the Court's rulings  on everyday politics in
              Hungary.   ***
