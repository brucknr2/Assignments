Abstract    :
                  9411487  Rowlands  This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for
              the  Department of Engineering Mechanics and Astronautics at the  University of
              Wisconsin to purchase a Moire Interferometer which  will be dedicated to the
              support of research for several ongoing  fundamental research projects dealing
              with metal-plate wood  connectors, superconductors, electronic devices and
              composites.   The Moire Interferometry system will enable attainment of the 
              fundamental scientific and engineering information needed to  formulate better
              design criteria, develop new and innovative  materials, improve the safety and
              reliability of the nation's  infrastructure and conserve natural resources.
