Abstract    :
              9411587  Pinkston  Communication complexity and latency is a critical problem in
               multiprocessor systems.  A major portion of communication latency  is
              associated with the interconnect network.  Optics has many  advantages for
              achieving low latency, scalable interprocessor  communication.  Recently, many
              optical interconnects have been  designed; however, little regard for
              system-level influences on the  interconnect architecture were taken into
              account in these designs.   The proposed research is to investigate an
              integrated design  solution for low latency multiprocessor communication. 
              Program  behavior, architecture, and optical technology considerations are 
              factored into the overall interconnect design.  This will lead to  a design
              capable of increased network throughput and optimal  processor-memory
              connectivity.     Engineering design principles will be developed for applying
              high  bandwidth, reconfigurable optical interconnects to electronic  digital
              multiprocessor systems.  An optical interconnect strategy  that incorporates
              latency reduction and hiding techniques will be  developed.  An interconnect
              simulator will be written to assist in  the design and performance evaluation
              efforts.  A small scale  optical interconnect demonstrator unit will be built
              to show  feasibility.  Hence, an outgrowth of this research is an optical 
              design framework (design methodology, simulation tools and  prototype) that
              will build infrastructure and allow for empirical  evaluation of a large design
              space.  ***
