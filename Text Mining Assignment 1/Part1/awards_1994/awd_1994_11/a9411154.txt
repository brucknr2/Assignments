Abstract    :
                   The research covers aspects of holomorphically convex  domains in several
              complex variables and complex geometry.  Particular questions relate to the
              topology and geometry of  classes of covering spaces of complex manifolds and
              their related  function theory.       The topics covered in the proposal cover
              several important  aspects of the analysis of several complex variables and
              related  geometry. Besides their relevance to other areas of mathematics,  the
              techniques have by tradition had applications to mathematical  physics and
              several branches of the engineering sciences such as  elasticity theory and
              aerodynamics.  ***
