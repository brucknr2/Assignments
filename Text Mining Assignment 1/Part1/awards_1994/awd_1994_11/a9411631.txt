Abstract    :
              9411631  Hudetz  The research proposed in this application is the study of 
              angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in microvascular  networks.  Major
              hypothesis is that microvascular network  development is the result of
              endothelial shear stress, and  that communication of stress occurs between
              cells and  vessels, possibly through growth factors.  Three models are 
              proposed: a mathematical model in which network development  proceeds according
              to specified experiment based rules, an  experimental network of microtubes
              seeded with endothelial  cells, and an in vivo model of the cerebral
              vasculature of  the one-to-three week old rat.  ***
