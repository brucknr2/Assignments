Abstract    :
              The Rochester group will pursue a program of research  related to improving the
              sensitivity of acoustic  gravitational wave detectors.  They will concentrate
              on  improving electromechanical transducers to extract signals  from antennas. 
              They will also explore technology needed for  greatly improved detectors of the
              future.  This work will contribute to the ongoing efforts around the  world to
              seek gravitational waves predicted by Einstein to  come from cataclysmic
              astronomical events throughout the  universe.
