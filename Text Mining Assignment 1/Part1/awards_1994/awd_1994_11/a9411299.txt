Abstract    :
                This project - the Informedial Project - establishes a large on-  line digital
              video library by developing intelligent, automatic  mechanisms to populate the
              library which allows for full content-  and knowledge-based search and
              retrieval via desktop computer and  metropolitan area networks.  The
              distinguishing feature of the  technical approach is the integrated application
              of speech,  language and image understanding technologies for efficient 
              creation (acquisition, recognition, segmentation, and indexing) and 
              exploration (query, search, retrieval, and display) of the library.   Also, a
              network billing server will be implemented to study the  economics of charging
              strategies and incorporate mechanisms to  ensure privacy and security.
