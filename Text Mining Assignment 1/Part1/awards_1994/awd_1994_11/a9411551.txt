Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to purchase a double pulsed laser system which would
              be dedicated to Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) studies of mixing flows and
              chemically reacting flows.  This equipment will enhance the PI's existing
              Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIV) capabilities and would allow for the
              first time, simultaneous, non-intrusive velocity and scalar information to be
              obtained.  It would then be possible to perform fundamental measurements on the
              nature and mechanisms of mixing and combustion in complex flows.  Of particular
              interest would be the turbulent jet/crossed flow studies of NOx formation.
