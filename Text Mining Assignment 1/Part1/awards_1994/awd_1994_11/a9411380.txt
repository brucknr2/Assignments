Abstract    :
              9411380  Dodds  Periphyton (benthic algae and associated heterotrophs) is the
              most important source of fixed carbon in many shallow aquatic systems.  The
              upper layer of the algal assemblage is exposed to high levels of irradiance,
              and thus may be susceptible to inhibition from increased UV radiation.  Data on
              the effect of expected increases in incident UV radiation on photosynthetic
              rates of periphyton are extremely limited; if such effects are severe, they
              could impair ecosystem function.  Equipment will be constructed to explore the
              relationships between high UV irradiance and photoinhibition in intact
              periphyton assemblages using O2 microelectrodes to estimate in situ
              photosynthetic rates, and light microprobes will be developed to assess UV
              exposure and light attenuation.  UV will be supplemented with a passive solar
              UV concentrator.  The concentrator will use parabolic mirrors to concentrate
              sunlight, and remove all but the ultra-violet regions of the spectrum with
              filters, and guide the light to periphyton assemblages with fiber optics.  This
              proposal will allow construction and testing of the solar UV concentrator.  The
              system will be tested with experiments of several weeks duration on periphyton
              inhabiting the streams of Konza Prairie Research Natural Area.    The proposed
              research is unique because long term (weeks) UV supplementation experiments of
              natural assemblages have not occurred.  The techniques developed will allow
              assessment of long term effects of global increases of UV irradiance.
