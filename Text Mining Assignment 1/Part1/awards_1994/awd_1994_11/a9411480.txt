Abstract    :
              9411480  McCaughan  While Ti:LiNb03-based guided wave optics have produced the
              most sophisticated integrated optic structures to date, present devices lack
              the ability to produce or to amplify light.  We propose to develop LiNbO3-based
              guided wave optical amplifiers and lasers, incorporating Er3+ as the amplifying
              medium and intersecting waveguides as a likely waveguide geometry.  A new class
              of integrated optic devices will result from the successful integration of
              optical amplifiers and lasers with existing guided wave electro-optic elements.
               These will include integrable amplifiers to offset losses inherent in
              integrated optics, laser-modulator integration, tunable lasers for wavelength
              division multiplexing, and pulsed light sources.  In order to carry out this
              research cost-sharing is provided to purchase a color-center laser.  This
              instrument will enable characterization of several key fluorescence and
              absorption measurements over the wavelength range of 1450-1650nm.  The laser
              will allow determination of parameters such as Er3 diffusion profiles and
              optimum waveguide geometries of diode pumping.  In addition, it will permit
              extension of site-selective spectroscopy to the infrared.  ***
