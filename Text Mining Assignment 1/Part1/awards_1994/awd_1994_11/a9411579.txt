Abstract    :
              9411579  Morse    The Department of Electrical Engineering at Yale University 
              proposes to purchase a Sun Microsystems SPARCstation 10 Model 41  computer
              workstation which will be dedicated to support research  in systems engineering
              at Yale.  The computer will be used by  students and post doctoral fellows
              within a research group headed  by A.S. Morse.  The machine will be used as a
              research tool in  conjunction with projects in the areas of self-adjusting, 
              intelligent and hybrid dynamical systems.  The computer will be  used primarily
              for simulation studies, for system synthesis, for  software development, and
              for graphic and visualization  applications.  ***
