Abstract    :
              9411572  Davis  This is an award to assist in the purchase of equipment for 
              conduct of research the objectives of which are to study the  behavior of
              aerosols in indoor air.  The equipment is planned for  use in optimizing design
              of filters for removing air pollutants,  formulating a filtration model for
              prediction of filter  efficiency, identification of conditions for minimizing
              the  production of bioaerosols and validation of the signature lipid  biomarker
              method of bioaerosol air sampling.    A result of this award is expected to
              provide the investigators  with a biocontaminant indoor air quality laboratory
              that can be  used in conducting research as noted above.  In addition, the 
              investigators plan on conducting research on indoor air quality  in residential
              and commercial buildings and in facilities used  for transportation of people. 
              The proposal leading to this award  was submitted in response to NSF 93-155,
              Research Equipment Grant  Program.  ***
