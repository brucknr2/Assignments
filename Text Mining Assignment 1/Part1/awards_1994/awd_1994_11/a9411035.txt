Abstract    :
               The retina of the eye continues to be a part of the nervous system that
              provides important advances in our knowledge about information processing
              mechanisms, including neuronal microcircuitry and synaptic communication,
              computational studies, neural development, and how perceptual psychophysics is
              related to sensory biology.  This symposium concentrates on recent advances in
              understanding these aspects of vision, and provides a unique opportunity for
              intensive discussions among a small group.  The focus is on events occuring in
              the retina directly related to information processing, including information
              flows in retinal networks, biophysics of synaptic communication, and
              computational and modeling approaches.  Participants include those with primary
              interests in sensory physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, anatomy and
              ultrastructure, engineering, and computational modeling.  The discussions in
              interdisciplinary group will have substantial impact on the future directions
              of visual studies in the retina, with likely added impact on areas of
              artificial vision and network analysis for information processing.
