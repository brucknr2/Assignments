Abstract    :
              9411521  Roan           ABSTRACT      Palm Beach Regional Educational and
              Training Alliance for Changing Industrial Needs (Palm Beach RETRAIN)    The
              University of Florida, School Board of Palm Beach County, Florida Atlantic
              University, Indiana River Community College, Palm Beach Community College,
              Treasure Coast Private Industry Council, Business Development Board of Palm
              Beach County, Private Industry Council of Palm Beach County and Pratt & Whitney
              have formed an Alliance to meet the educational and retraining needs of
              displaced defense workers in the Palm Beach area.  The goal of the Alliance is
              to increase high quality employment in Florida by retraining the workforce for
              commercial manufacturing industries.  Sophisticated delivery systems, such as
              compressed video for interactive distance learning, and educational
              clearinghouse services will help achieve the Alliance goals.  Resources
              available to the Alliance include the Florida Information Resource Network and
              the Florida Engineering Educational Delivery System.  Industry will provide
              on-site classrooms, equipment, and support systems.  ***
