Abstract    :
              9411257  Stann    This Americas Program award will support a workshop, 
              organized by the American Association for the  Advancement of Science (AAAS),
              to assess priorities  for implementing the 1993 United Nations Convention on 
              Biological Diversity. The workshop will be the first  phase of a project to
              work cooperatively with the  nations of the hemisphere in implementing the 
              Convention, and will bring together leading members of  the biodiversity
              community of the Western Hemisphere  with other science leaders of the region. 
              The meeting  will take place in Manaus, Brazil, in June 1994.       The
              Convention on Biological Diversity has placed  numerous requirements on
              signatory nations to develop  comprehensive strategies for conservation related
              to  economic and social development.  The workshop will  entail the preparation
              of complete status reports  reflecting the readiness of the countries' 
              infrastructure, education and training, and funding  resources to carry out
              national biodiversity  conservation strategies.  An expected outcome of the 
              workshop is the promotion of biodiversity  collaborative research in the
              region.   ***
