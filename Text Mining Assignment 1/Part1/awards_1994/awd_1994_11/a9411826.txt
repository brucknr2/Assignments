Abstract    :
                  9411826  KOWAL   This award will pay for travel to conduct field work and
              museum visits in Switzerland, West Germany and Spain and laboratory supplies
              for molecular (chromosome preparation, DNA sequencing) studies to enhance the
              dissertation work of a PhD graduate student, Harvey E. Ballard.  The research
              project of this student involves a phylogenetic analysis of species group
              relationships in the large plant genus Viola.  This genus includes the "true
              violets" and may contain as many as 600 to 700 species.  The research proposed
              will utilize karyological or chromosomal data (largely taken from the
              literature), morphological data and molecular (chloroplast DNA) data to address
              relationships of lineages within this large genus.  %%%   Support for the
              training of graduate students in modern systematic methodologies is important
              for maintaining a workforce of scientists capable of meeting the questions and
              issues of biodiversity which are of increasing global concern.  ***
