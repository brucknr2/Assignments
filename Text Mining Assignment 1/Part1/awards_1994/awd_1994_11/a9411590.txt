Abstract    :
               This project deals with both theoretical and prototyping  research  in parallel
              processing to harness the power of workstation  clusters.  The primary
              techniques will based on aggressive  scheduling, evasive memory and  dispersed
              data management.  The  formal work expands the previous results of the  PIS in 
              asynchronous computing in several directions:   (1)  Extend the models  to
              models to fine-grained programs.  (2)  Permit the inclusion of architecture 
              specific  characteristics into theoretical frameworks.  (3)  Techniques to 
              distinguish inconsistencies in memory states  as viewed by different processors
               resulting from time-outs,  interrupts and failures (or indefinite postponement
               of a  computation). (4)  Techniques to allow non-deterministic executions. 
              (5)  Model input/output operations of fault-tolerant programs.    Thee
              experimental  part of the project will build a scaled version  to execute
              parallel programs on  clusters of workstations.  The  prototype will address
              issues related to the  eager scheduling of  threads, the implementation of
              evasive memory and data  management.  The prototype will attempt to evaluate
              the  effectiveness of the  environment in terms of efficiency.    This project
              is conducted jointly by P.  Dasgupta of Arizona State  University and Z. Kedem,
              of New York University.
