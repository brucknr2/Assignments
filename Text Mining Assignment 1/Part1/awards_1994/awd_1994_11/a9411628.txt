Abstract    :
              This mechanical testing system with controlled atmosphere  for experiments on
              advanced materials will permit studies of  creep, fatigue, and quasi-static
              mechanical testing in inert  and oxidizing environments at temperatures up to
              1700  Centigrade.  Research areas include high-temperature  deformation of
              fiber-reinforced metal and ceramic  composites, superplasticity and creep of
              fine-grained  ceramics, metals and composites, stress corrosion in metals  and
              metal matrix composites, and deformation twining in  intermetallic alloys. 
              This system will help establish a  center for composites research, which is a
              major new  initiative at the University of Southern California.The  system will
              also be used in materials-related research  projects such as fatigue durability
              of dental composite  restoratives, and solid mechanics of advanced structural 
              materials.
