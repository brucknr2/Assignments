Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to develop mid-range theories of new forms of business
              organization.  He will perform ethnographic case studies of organizational
              re-design episodes in Japan and the United States.  Primary targets of the
              study will be the enabling effects of information technology on the design of
              new organizational forms and a comparative study of American and Japanese
              transnational corporations.  The NSF portion of the funding will support a
              subset of the research which includes German, Japanese, and American
              corporations.  The research program has two phases.  During Phase I, the PI
              will perform comparative surveys of the organizational design challenges facing
              managers in companies in the three cultures.  In Phase II the PI will study
              organizational heuristics invented and implemented in order to achieve critical
              capabilities.
