Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to purchase a digital imaging system in support of
              several research programs, including, in particular, the study of the formation
              and burning of sprays of liquid fuels.  The equipment includes a Nd-Yag pumped
              dye laser, a CCD camera and a dedicated computer for data acquisition and
              processing.
