Abstract    :
              Parsons    Under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, Ms. Starr Farr will 
              collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct  archaeological
              excavation at Bloody Point, an indigenous Native  American village site on the
              island of St. Kitts. The site  appears to have both prehistoric and early
              historic period  components. She will analyze the ceramics and other materials 
              collected from both trash midden and household contexts and  attempt to
              reconstruct both ethnic affiliation and social  organization based on these
              remains.    In recent years there has been great interest in the collision of 
              European and indigenous American peoples and cultures. Recent  scholarship on
              the Island Carib of the Lesser Antilles has  questioned traditional models of
              native society and the ways in  which they adapted to change in the face of
              contact. Ms. Farr  believes that in response to changed conditions, indigenous 
              political and social realignments occurred and that new ethnic  identities were
              rapidly forged. The research is important because  it will increase our
              understanding of how human societies adapt  to intense, rapid and unexpected
              change. It will also assist in  the training of a promising young scientist.
