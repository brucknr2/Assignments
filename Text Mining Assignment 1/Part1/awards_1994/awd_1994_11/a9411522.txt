Abstract    :
              9411522  Henderson      ABSTRACT    Holistic Approach for Preparing Students to
              Learn and Lead in a New Manufacturing Paradigm    Arizona State University has
              team with Motorola, Intel, Honeywell and others to infuse manufacturing
              education across the engineering curriculum at Arizona State -- from the
              freshman year through the master's level.  This project will focus on
              leadership training, total quality principles, recruiting displaced defense
              workers and underrepresented groups, and enhancing the curriculum.  The long
              term goal is to produce a new breed of engineer for the 21st century, one
              equipped with the hard and soft skills necessary to change manufacturing.  ***
