Abstract    :
                    9411706  LEE    The focus of this study is the weaving culture of Alaska
              Yup'ik and Inupiat Eskimo. Practiced continuously for at least a century,
              coiled basketry is nonetheless almost completely undocumented. Coiled basketry
              is a women's art and as such has been eclipsed by male art forms such as ivory
              carving and mask-making. This collaborative Alaska Native study will be a first
              step in documenting this art form. The hypothesis that rapid social change
              negatively impacts indigenous art forms will be examined as will the role of
              art in reinforcing cultural and gender identity in Native Alaska.  ***     ??
