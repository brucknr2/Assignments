Abstract    :
              9411503  Arbib    Fast  movements  appear  to  be  "stereotyped,"  yet  high 
              speed  videotaping   reveals  significant  variability  in   stereotyped 
              behaviors.  Fast  movements  are  usually  composed  of   several  separate  
              patterns   of   muscle  coordination   called   "motor  synergies."  For
              example, the rapid movements of a frog  snapping  at a worm, which take less
              than 1/6th of a second, is composed of  a  "lunge  synergy" (jumping towards
              the worm) together with  the  "jaw-tongue synergy" (the jaw opens, the tongue
              projects  to  hit  the  worm,  the tongue retracts bringing the worm into the 
              mouth  and the jaw closes). This study is designed to understand how the  brain
               coordinates  multiple synergies, and  how  synergies  that  occur  later  in 
              the  behavior use feedback  to  compensate  for  inaccuracies of synergies that
              occur earlier in the behavior. The  study  will involve analysis of the
              behavior by high speed  video  taping, and recording of signals from the
              muscles controlling the  behavior  and the parts of the brain and spinal cord 
              controlling  the  muscles.  Studies already done by these  investigators  show 
              that both synergies are variable, and that tongue projection  can  compensate
              for inaccuracy in the lunge. Data collected  from  the  study will be used in
              neural network modeling of adaptability and  coordination of rapid movements.
              The results of this study  could  provide new insights into the control of
              rapid limb movements  by  the brain and control of robots.
