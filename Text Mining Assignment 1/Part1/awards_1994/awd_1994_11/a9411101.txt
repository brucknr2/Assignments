Abstract    :
                The rpo genes encode the subunits of an eubacterial-  like RNA polymerase in
              plant chloroplasts. Genes which play a  central role in plastid function are
              normally slow to evolve but in  the family Geraniaceae, however, the rpo genes
              appear to be  evolving at a faster rate than are the other plastid genes. In
              the  species Pelargonium hortorum, the rate of evolution seems to be 
              strikingly higher. The goal of this research is to understand the  extent of
              constraints on and the mechanisms responsible for the  strikingly accelerated
              evolution of these genes. Specifically, (1)  the rpo genes from Pelargonium
              will be sequenced (2) the promotor  regions of other plastid genes will be
              examined to determine if  they have changed at a similar rate and (3) the
              possibility of RNA  editing will be investigated by sequencing cDNAs of the rpo
              genes.  %%%  The results of this work will contribute to our understanding at 
              the level of the genome of the constraints and enhancers affecting  the rate of
              evolutionary change.
