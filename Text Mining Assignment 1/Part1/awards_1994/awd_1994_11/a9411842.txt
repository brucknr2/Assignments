Abstract    :
                    9411842  Tittmann  The Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for
              the  Engineering Science and Mechanics Department at Pennsylvania State 
              University to purchase Atomic Force Microscopy equipment which will  be
              dedicated to the formation of an Engineering Nano  Characterization (ENC)
              Center to support research and education in  engineering.  The equipment will
              be used for various research  projects including; characterization of
              thermo-mechanical damage in  gas turbine materials, in-situ evaluation of
              surface corrosion on  A1 and Mg alloys, optimization of surface engineering and
              coating  technology, surface diagnostics for nanofabrication of Micro 
              Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS) and characterization of grain  boundary
              microstructure in semi solid A1 alloys for metal working.   The ENC Center will
              be used by faculty and graduate students for  research and for laboratory
              education of both undergraduate and  graduate students in NDE and Failure
              Analysis Prevention courses.   An estimated 30 students and 10 faculty per year
              will use the ENC  Center Facilities.  ***
