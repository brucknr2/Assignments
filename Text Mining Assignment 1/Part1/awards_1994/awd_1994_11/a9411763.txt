Abstract    :
              9411763  Deb  This is an award to support travel by the applicant to attend the 
              regional meeting of the European International Water Supply  Association that
              will be held in Zurich, Switzerland from May 15-  20, 1994.  The investigator
              will address a plenary session of the  conference on "Water Distribution System
              Performance Indicators"  following the Keynote Address.    This conference will
              address technologies and methodologies for  rehabilitation of water
              distribution systems, a matter of great  concern with respect to the aging of
              U.S. municipal water  distribution system components of the urban
              infrastructure.  Results are expected to identify research needs associated
              with  addressing the ability of these systems to provide adequate  quantities
              of water, dependably and efficiently.
