Abstract    :
              This is a research planning grant for a minority investigator, Luis   Colon, who
              is a new faculty member of analytical chemistry at the State   University of
              New York at Buffalo.  In this work, Professor Colon will   develop a research
              proposal on the synthesis of modified chromatographic   stationary phases using
              sol-gel chemistry.  Here, the alkyl moieties   normally used to modify
              chromatographic supports are introduced during   the formation of the glass or
              silica support.  These materials are   expected to have better hydrolytic
              stability than conventional   chromatographic stationary phases.    This
              research planning grant supports the efforts of Luis Colon to   develop new
              materials to serve as the basis for separation of a wide   range of chemical
              species.  The materials developed here may be resistant   to a broader range of
              harsh solution conditions than the traditional   materials.  Potential
              applications include separations of   biotechnological, pharmaceutical and
              environmental importance.
