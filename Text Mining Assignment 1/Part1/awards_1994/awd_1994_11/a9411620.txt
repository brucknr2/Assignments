Abstract    :
              9411620  Perdrisat  Research will be carried out using polarization degrees of 
              freedom to study properties of the nucleon and few-nucleon  systems.  Focal
              plane polarimeters will be constructed for use at  the MIT/Bates and CEBAF
              accelerators.  The charge form factor of  the proton will be measured using
              electron scattering  polarization transfer to the recoil proton.  Hadronic
              studies of  few-body reactions, again using polarized beams, will be carried 
              out at Saturne and Dubna aimed at studying the deuterium d-state  wave function
              and other structure details.  At CEBAF, nucleon and  meson spectroscopy studies
              will be carried out, one element of  which will focus on phi-meson
              electro-production to search for  anomalous strangeness content in the nucleon.
               A search for  predicted nucleon resonances, but heretofore not observed, will 
              also be carried out at CEBAF.  ***
