Abstract    :
              9411848  Ranker       Graduate student Chrissen Gemmill, under the supervision
              of  faculty adviser Thomas Ranker at the University of Colorado, is  studying
              the taxonomy, phylogeny, and population genetics of  Hawaiian species of the
              palm genus Pritchardia.  There are an  estimated 25 species in the genus, 19 in
              Hawaii and the rest in the  South Pacific.  Eight or so species occur in
              isolated, small  populations and may prove to be genetically depauperate and 
              endangered.  Morphological and molecular studies are being  conducted, the
              latter including electrophoresis of proteins to  assess levels of genetic
              variability and sequencing of nuclear DNA  regions (ITS regions) to measure
              mutational differences among  species.  Combined morphological and molecular
              evidence will  improve taxonomic discrimination of the Hawaiian species and 
              provide characters for reliable identification and for inferring a  hypothesis
              of evolutionary history.       Because conservation and management decisions
              must be based on  reliable taxonomic treatments, an improved classification of 
              Pritchardia palms, based on combined morphological and molecular  data, will
              answer the needs for accurate identification and  measurement of genetic
              variability in wild populations.
