Abstract    :
              9411538  Soltis       Graduate student Joanna Schultz, under the supervision of 
              faculty adviser Pamela Soltis at Washington State University, is  studying two
              related genera in the phlox family Polemoniaceae,  Leptodactylon and Linanthus.
               The two present opportunities to  contrast alternative processes of speciation
              in plants, either  sympatric/parapatric through polyploidy (whether following 
              hybridization or not) and allopatric, usually through dispersal and  isolation
              of small peripheral populations.  Morphological and  molecular evidence, the
              latter including extensive data from  chloroplast DNA and from protein
              isozymes, will be acquired to  infer phylogenetic relationships among species
              and to assess likely  routes of origin by analyzing patterns of genetic
              variation in  closely related species.       Robust phylogenetic analysis of
              closely related species, based  on combined morphological and molecular
              evidence, provides the  strongest test cases for assessing the relative
              importance of  contrasting mechanisms of plant speciation, whether through 
              polyploid evolution (usually involving hybridization of sympatric  congeners)
              or through geographic speciation (allopatric  divergence).
