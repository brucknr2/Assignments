Abstract    :
              9411609  Asbeck  A sampling oscilloscope will be purchased which will be
              dedicated to support research in the characterization of high speed devices and
              integrated circuits, supporting activities of at least four faculty members. 
              It will enable research efforts to explore the application of high speed
              semiconductor technologies to commercially important systems such as high speed
              fiber links and wireless communications.  Specific projects that will benefit
              include:  development of high speed optical modulators and driver amplifiers;
              development of ultrahigh speed Read-Only-Memories for frequency synthesis;
              measurement of high frequency characteristics of HBTs, including large signal
              characteristics and storage time; development of high speed, low power circuits
              based on resonant-tunnel-diode/heterostructure transistor combinations; and
              development of novel microwave mixer circuits.  ***
