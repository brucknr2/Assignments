Abstract    :
              This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports the  
              research efforts of Professor Hussey and his graduate students on the  
              electrodeposition of alloys from room-temperature, chloroaluminate molten  
              salts.  The deposition process will be characterized using   electrochemical
              methods, scanning electron microscopy and light   microscopy.  Through these
              studies, the attendant nucleation mechanisms   for thin film growth will be
              characterized.  Professor Hussey will   collaborate with Dr. Gery Stafford at
              the National Institute of Standards   and Technology on the metallurgical
              aspects of this research.    This work is focussed on the synthesis and
              characterization of novel thin   films of metal alloys that could provide
              materials with enhanced   properties for a variety of technological
              applications.  These films are   produced by the electrodeposition of metals
              from aluminum containing   salts that are liquids at room temperature.  This
              approach should result   in alloy films with a much lower degree of
              contamination than was   previously possible to achieve.
