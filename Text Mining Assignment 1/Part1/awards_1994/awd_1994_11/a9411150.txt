Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9411150  Leslie Bauman  Mississippi State University      The
              Career Advancement Award will permit the PI to apply her Knowledge of
              experimental techniques for magnethohydrodynamics to develop diagnostics for
              combustors and incinerators.  Emission absorption lineshape fitting will be
              developed as a tool for measuring temperature profiles.  Velocity profiles will
              be determined using multi-wavelength crosscorrelation of light emission.  The
              combination of these techniques will permit simultaneous temperature and
              velocity measurements with applications to high speed and high temperature
              flows.
