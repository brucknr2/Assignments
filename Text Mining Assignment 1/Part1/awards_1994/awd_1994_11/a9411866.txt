Abstract    :
              9411866  Nair  This project deals with the development of a high-speed 
              integrated control station for carrying out fundamental  studies in modeling
              and intelligent control of nonlinear  dynamic systems using neural networks,
              fuzzy logic, and  neuro-fuzzy architectures. The control station is also 
              equipped to interface with real-world hardware systems for  performing on-line
              control studies. The equipment acquired  under this grant facilitates real-time
              implementation and  analytical studies such as parameter convergence, tracking 
              control, learning and adaptation issues with unmodeled  dynamics, high speed
              operation, disturbance rejection  control and stochastic control.  ***
