Abstract    :
              9411661  Saadatmanesh  The Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering
              Mechanics at  the University of Arizona will purchase a materials test system 
              which will be dedicated to support large-scale testing and  research in the
              area of structural engineering.  The equipment  will be used for several
              research projects including  strengthening of unreinforced masonry structures
              with fiber  composite fabrics, utilization of modern materials for 
              strengthening of existing bridges, bond of glass-fiber-reinforced-  plastic
              (GFRP) reinforcing bars to concrete, etc.  The equipment  will also be used to
              support undergraduate courses on materials  testing.  ***
