Abstract    :
                The larvae of tent caterpillars display a diversity of lifestyles,  ranging
              from solitary individuals to simple aggregations to highly  integrated
              societies.  There are six Malacosoma species in North  American as well as five
              European species.  Social complexity in  this group is defined in terms of
              interaction and communication  between group members, and is thought to be
              correlated with  patterns of host plant utilization and foraging.  The
              diversity of  social forms in this genus provides a model system for the 
              elucidation of ecological correlates to the evolution of sociality,  as well as
              of the ways in which sociality may influence host plant  use.  Phylogenetic
              relationships among species of the social tent  caterpillar genus Malacosoma
              (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) will be  assessed through application of
              cladisitic methods to gene sequence  data to investigate patterns of
              social-behavioral evolution in this  group.       Some tent caterpillars are
              economic pests and better knowledge  of the group-living characteristics of
              this group is of important  economic interest to homeowners and farmers.
