Abstract    :
              9411543  Arnowitt           Research in theoretical particle physics will focus
              on the  applications of supersymmetry in describing basic interactions  among 
              constituents of matter.  Supersymmetry relates the two broad classes of fields 
              in the universe, those which constitute the basic building blocks of matter, 
              and those which describe the  forces among them.  The work will concentrate on 
              consequences of  this symmetry in processes which can be observed in the 
              laboratory, such as rare decays of heavy quarks, and on those which have 
              cosmological significance.  The results of the study  will be important in 
              furthering our understanding of the fundamental forces in nature.  ***
