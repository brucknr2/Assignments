Abstract    :
              9411595  Tuckness  This research equipment grant is made for the acquisition of 
              computing equipment in support of a global position/inertial  navigation
              system. Such systems are typically used for a variety  of dynamic
              vehicle-reflected applications. A Kalman filter is  used to process the
              measurements obtained by the positioning  system, and to enhance the
              performance of the navigation system.  In this project, improvements are made
              in the filter processing  of navigation information for sensor inputs supplied
              to the on-  board computer, and the resulting stability of integrated filter 
              system is investigated.  ***
