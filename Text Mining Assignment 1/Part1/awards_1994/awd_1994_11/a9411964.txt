Abstract    :
              9411964  Young  A continuing research program, largely using advanced
              computational  techniques, will further develop ideas in the areas of phase 
              transitions in disordered and frustrated systems, and in phase  transitions
              driven by quantum fluctuations.  One of the main  thrusts will be to study
              systems which combine disorder or  frustration with quantum fluctuations. 
              These problems are poorly  understood despite there being interesting
              experimental results.  %%%  This research program is one of the leading ones in
              the world that  studies the effects of disorder on the properties of complex 
              systems.  The present focus is on combining this expertise on the  effects of
              disorder a focus on systems which are driven by quantum  fluctuations, i.e.,
              superconductor to insulator transitions at  absolute zero temperature.  ***
