Abstract    :
                  This project will look at what regions of the ribosomal RNA genes, genes 
              common to all organism, reflect the ecological and morphological  diversity in
              a highly successful group of microcrustaceans.  The  Polyphemoidea consist of
              three families that either occur worldwide or  are currently invading new
              habitats.  One member, BYthotrephes,  invaded North America in the 1980s, and
              is now a permanent member of  the Great Lakes food web.  It feeds on similar
              food as young fish, but has  a long caudal spine that protects it from
              predation by small fish.  A  robust phylogeny or family tree is proposed to
              address whether the spine  in some members lengthened over time, and whether
              ecological benefits  occurred as animals became more protected.  The project
              will apply  molecular approaches to questions of organismal adaptations, and
              use  recombinant DNA technology to test ecological theory.  It will  complement
              other ongoing studies of microcrustacean relationships and  biogeography.  The
              research fellow will gain training in molecular  systematics to rigorously
              address and research questions in evolutionary  ecology.
