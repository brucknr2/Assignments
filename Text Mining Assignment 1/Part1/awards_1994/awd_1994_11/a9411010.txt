Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT  R.E. Spall  University of South Alabama  CTS-9411010      This
              equipment grant will assist in the purchase in of advanced post-processing
              capabilities for fluid flow visualization.  Several projects will be directly
              impacted including:  (1) numerical simulation of laminar and turbulent vortex
              breakdown;  (2) CFD simulation and analysis of turbulent, recirculating flows
              within combustor type geometries; and, (3) three-dimensional boundary element
              analysis of breaking water waves.  The acquisition of this equipment is
              expected to have a substantial impact upon the research infrastructure at the
              University.
