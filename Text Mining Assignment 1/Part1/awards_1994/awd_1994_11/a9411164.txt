Abstract    :
              9411164  Russell    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Glen A. Russell,
              Department of  Chemistry, Iowa State University, to pursue with Dr. Woonphil
              Baik, Department  of Chemistry, Myong Ji University, Korea, for 30 months, a
              program of  cooperative research on free radical reactions of nitro compounds. 
              This  research will involve (1) exploring the reason(s) underlying the lack of 
              reactivity between allylic nitronate anions and 2-halo-2-nitro-propanes when 
              photostimulated and (2) extensions of the basic SRN1 mechanisms to new types 
              of free radical chain processes involving electron transfer reactions of 
              aliphatic nitro compounds.  The possibility of achieving cyclization reactions 
              of hindered phenoxide radicals with a tethered nitronate anion also will be 
              investigated.    The proposed research will attempt to extend general
              understanding of the  mechanism of certain free radical chain substitution
              reactions with  appropriate anions (nucleophiles).  The collaborators are
              highly respected  researchers in the field of the proposal.  This project is
              relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which
              seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists
              and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills,
              and  techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit. 
              Korean  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and
              Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  ***
