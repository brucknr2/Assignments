Abstract    :
                    9411906  Hui  This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the 
              Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of New  Orleans to
              purchase an advanced state of the art computer aided  materials testing system.
               This equipment will impact the  department and college by enhancing the
              capabilities and  effectiveness of the faculty and graduate students in
              performing  research and development in the fundamentals and applications of 
              advanced materials and in enhancing the academic program by  exposing graduate
              and undergraduate students to advanced materials  testing procedures.  ***
