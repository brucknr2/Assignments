Abstract    :
              9411169  Cheverud  This is a proposal to stduy the phylogenetic (genealogical)
              relationships among the eleven species and subspecies of tamarins
              (Primates:Saguinus) using mitochondrial DNA sequence data.  The molecular
              phylogeny will be used to test hypotheses about the biology of tamarins based
              on biogeographic distribution and coat color variation.  One of the fascinating
              trends within this group of primates involves the patterns of color variation
              in the fur.  Controversy has centered on a model of constrained
              ("metachromism") versus unconstrained historical change in coat color.  The
              phylogenetic framework of this study will permit rigorous tests of these
              hypotheses for the first time.
