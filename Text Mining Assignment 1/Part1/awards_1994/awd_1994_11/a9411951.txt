Abstract    :
              9411951  Delph     The study of plant-disease interactions is of fundamental
              importance for improving our ability to control plant diseases and our
              understanding of host-pathogen coevolution.  Two areas of little previous
              research are addressed by this project: to what extent does variation in
              genetic and environmnetal factors explain the patchy distribution of disease in
              nature, and how does disease influence the evolution of the host's breeding
              system?  This project examines the relationship between Silene acaulis and a
              pollinator-transmitted fungal disease, Microbotryum violaceum to address these
              questions.    This research will improve our understanding of host-pathogen
              ecology and coevolution.  The results of this study may have application to the
              field of plant pathology, specifically disease prevention and control in crops.
