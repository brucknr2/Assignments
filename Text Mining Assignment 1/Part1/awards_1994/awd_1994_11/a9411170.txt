Abstract    :
              9411170  Feng  A serendipitous development of theoretical physics in the past 
              decade was the apparent confluence of the central themes of  several areas of
              physics:  quantum measurement, quantum chaos,  mesoscopic physics and quantum
              cosmology.  Although all these  robust areas focus on vastly different aspects
              of physics,  covering atomic-molecular, quantm optics, condensed matter as 
              well as nuclear, particle physics and general relativity, it  seems that they
              all stand on the questions of quantum-classical  correspondence (QCC).  ***
