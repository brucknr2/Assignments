Abstract    :
                    The hormones of the posterior pituitary are known to function  in 
              regulating water/mineral balance, stimulating contractions of the  reproductive
               tract,  and controlling lactation.  Recently  these  hormones  have  been
              discovered to be distributed throughout  the  brain  and  have been implicated
              in the regulation  of  behaviors  such   as   attention,   learning,  
              communication,   aggression,  reproduction  and  parenting. This project
              examines  whether  the  pituitary  hormone vasotocin plays a crucial role in
              coordinating  the  body's  physiological  responses to  changing  environmental
               conditions  while  at the same time modulating  the  individual's  social 
              behavior.  The  hypothesis is that  environmental  stress  causes massive
              vasotocin release into the bloodstream, inhibiting  gonadal  function, 
              inhibiting vasotocin action  in  brain  areas  regulating social behavior, and
              inhibiting reproductive behavior.  In   contrast,  nonstressful  environmental 
              conditions  decrease  vasotocin  release  into  the bloodstream  while 
              increasing  its  production in brain circuits modulating social behavior, 
              leading  to  the  onset of reproduction and paternal behavior. Experiments 
              will  measure  the  distribution of vasotocin in  the  brain  and  observe 
              social behavior under different environmental conditions  to  test  the 
              hypothesis.  If this  hypothesis  is  correct,  it  suggests that it may be
              very difficult for the body to respond to  physiological  stress  without 
              inadvertently  affecting   social  behavior.
