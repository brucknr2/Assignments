Abstract    :
              The role of solvation in interfacial electrochemistry is the focus of this
              research project,  supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. 
              Ion transfer reactions, probed  spectroscopically and electrochemically, will
              be used to study the mechanism of solvation.   Single crystal gold electrodes
              modified with self-assembled monolayers form the basis of the  work.  The role
              of water at these interfaces will be probed using admittance measurements and 
              simple electron transfer test reactions.  Solvation in very fast electron
              transfer processes will be  examined, and the theory of solvation for these
              systems will be developed.  The information  generated by this study will be
              useful in developing an understanding of charge transfer and  control in
              biological membrane systems.    An experimental and theoretical study of charge
              transfer at organic monolayer modified gold  electrodes is the focus of this
              research project.  Understanding the mechanism and kinetics of  electron
              transport across these model membranes will be useful for understanding the
              role of  solvation in these biological model systems.
