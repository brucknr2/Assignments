Abstract    :
              9411844  Howarth  The dimensions of stream ecosystem studies have been greatly
              expanded within the last decade to include saturated sediments that lie beneath
              and adjacent to the streambed. Recent work indicates the hyporheic zone's
              importance in regulating stream metabolism, altering stream chemistry, and
              supporting stream food webs. Although the hyporheic zone contains diverse
              microbial and invertebrate communities, benthic bacteria are at the base of the
              hyporheic food web and thought to control much of its ecosystem function. The
              primary energy source  for benthic bacteria is dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
              This dissertation research will determine the extent to which variation in DOC
              quality and quantity affects the microbial community in stream hyporheic zones.
              Research will address how DOC from contrasting sources within and among streams
              that are thought to vary in DOC quality and quantity affect the bacterial
              community in the hyporheic zone. Changes in bacterial abundance and
              productivity in response to changes in DOC, as well as subsequent changes in
              water chemistry will be studied. This research will also determine if hyporheic
              microbes serve as a carbon sink or an important link to higher trophic levels
              in stream food webs.   %%%  The objectives of this research will lead to a
              greater understanding of both stream ecosystem function and microbial loop
              dynamics. This study will provide an excellent forum to link ecosystem-level
              function with previously poorly understood microbial processes.
