Abstract    :
              9411547  Provine/Carbone  This dissertation project will provide support for
              interviews and  archival research on the evolving role of the laboratory animal
               veterinarian.  The research will be undertaken by the staff  veterinarian for
              Cornell University's Center for Research Animal  Resources, towards completion
              of the PhD degree in Science and  Technology Studies.  When pressures mounted
              from the animal rights  community during the 1980s, the U.S. Congress increased
              its  regulation of animal-based research dramatically, thus empowering  the
              laboratory animal veterinarians who oversee the welfare of  research animals. 
              These veterinarians, employed by research  institutions, now have enormous
              responsibility.  The central aims  of this research are to develop a historical
              understanding of the  evolving definition of laboratory animal veterinarian and
              to  examine professional and moral difficulties inherent in reconciling 
              competing models of what the veterinarian should be.  The  researcher will
              follow review of government documents and  scientific and philosophical
              literature with interviews with the  scientists, animal protectionists and
              veterinarians who have tried  to shape the legal role of research
              veterinarians.  The analysis  will provide insight into the complex
              interactions between  scientists' values and society's values, against the
              changing  backdrop of our understanding of the nature of non-human animals.
