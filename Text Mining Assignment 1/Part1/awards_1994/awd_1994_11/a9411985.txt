Abstract    :
              9411985  Shackelford  The objective of this Workshop is to promote intra- and 
              inter-national interaction between the academic,  governmental,  and industrial
              segments of the U.S. and  Scandinavian geotechnical communities. It is expected
              that  this interaction will lead to the definition of common  grounds
              concerning outstanding geotechnical problems and of  probable research avenues
              toward their solution. The  Workshop will draw together experts from U.S. and 
              Scandinavia in the following four areas: 1. ground  improvement for engineering
              and environmental purposes; 2.  deformation of geo-materials; 3. hazards,
              reliability and  risk assessment, and 4. investigation and performance  control
              for geo-structures.  ***
