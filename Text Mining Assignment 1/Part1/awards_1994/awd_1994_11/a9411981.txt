Abstract    :
              9411981  Hobeika  This award is being supported under NSF's Small Grants for 
              Exploratory Research program.  The focus of the project is to  study the
              impacts of the short and long-term transportation  strategies deployed after
              the January 17, 1994 Northridge,  California earthquake.  Two tasks will be
              pursued:  (1) the  collection of data on the closure of transportation
              facilities in  the immediate aftermath of the earthquake and its impacts on 
              transportation services, and (2) the analysis of short and long-  term
              emergency traffic management procedures used to minimize  transportation
              disruptions.  ***
