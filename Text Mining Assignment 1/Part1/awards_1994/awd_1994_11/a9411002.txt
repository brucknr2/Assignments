Abstract    :
              9411002  Rodgers       Theoretical studies of elementary particle physics will
              be  conducted.  These studies will include non-perturbative  approaches to
              quantum chromodynamics (the theory of the strong  nuclear interactions) using
              string theories in four dimensions,  explicit computer generated solutions, a
              study of a hierarchial  model as a test of non-perturbative ideas, and some
              work on  extended theories in gravity.  To date there is no satisfactory 
              explanation available for the non-perturbative nature of strong  interactions
              or the interaction of gravity with elementary  particles.  Understanding these
              fundamental interactions at a  rigorous mathematical level is important for
              further  understanding of particle physics.  ***
