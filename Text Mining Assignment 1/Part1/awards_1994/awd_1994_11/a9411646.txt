Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Roger Arndt  CTS-9411646    The St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory
              of  the University of Minnesota will purchase a Phase Doppler Anemometer System
              (PDA) for use in a broad range of fluid mechanics research.  The PDA system is
              essential for further work in cavitation, and will also enhance the
              capabilities for research in fluid mechanics, river mechanics, turbidity
              currents, aerosols, airborne particle motion, and aeration.   The system is
              designed for analysis of two phase flows containing bubbles, droplets or
              particles for measruements of particle size, velocity and volumn flux.  The
              system will also be used to replace the existing (purchased in 1983) 2D Laser
              Doppler Anemometer for single phase turbulence measurements.    This system
              will also be used in the high speed water tunnel, turbine test stand and the
              NSF sponsored wind tunnel for atmospheric flow simulation.    ***
