Abstract    :
              The Symposium on Subtypes of Muscarinic Receptors is the  sixth in a series of
              very successful and well-documented  conferences held over the past decade
              which have helped to  integrate advance in basic research with the results of 
              studies on the role of these receptors in dysfunctions.  The  conference
              organizers and participants are an international  group of scientists who
              represent a breadth of research  areas from academia and industry and who have
              made and are  making important contributions to muscarinic receptor  research. 
              This Symposium also provides the opportunity for  young investigators to
              present their work and will be the  occasion for the first Otto Loewi New
              Investigator Awards  and Lectures sponsored and supported by the Symposium.
