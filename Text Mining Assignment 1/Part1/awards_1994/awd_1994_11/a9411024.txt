Abstract    :
                The PIs propose to examine self-managed work teams (SMWTs).  Such teams
              consist of non-management employees who make management decisions related to
              their own work.  Such teams are becoming more prevalent in the US economy in an
              attempt to lower management costs as well as improve quality.  Two theories
              relating to SMWTs are those of Hackman (1988) and Salas et al. (1992).  The PIs
              will test these two theories by examining the performance levels of various
              work teams in order to determine which theory's predictions provide a more
              accurate description of the data.  Participating organizations will include
              Boeing, Texas Instruments, and the Department of Defense.
