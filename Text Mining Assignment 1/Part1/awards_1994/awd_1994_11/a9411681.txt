Abstract    :
              Wissmar  Streams, lakes, and wetlands are strongly influenced by the landscapes
              they drain.  They receive surface and subsurface waters, allochthonous carbon,
              sediments, nutrients, and pollutants.  The intensity of this landscape
              influence differs for large and small streams, lakes, or wetlands due to
              differences in perimeter to area ratios.  We will develop a model of landscape
              interactions called landscape allometry, and test this concept by examining the
              relationship between slough size and the amount of allochthonous insect and
              plant flotsam exported from the sloughs.  We will also dissect sloughs of
              various sizes to quantify detrital insect and plant fluxes from slough sections
              spanning a range of sizes; integrate the results over the entire slough; and
              compare integrated results with whole slough measurements.  We anticipate that
              landscape allometry will have broad application to other ecosystems, that it
              will contribute to the application of fractal geometry theory to ecology, and
              that it could influence management of habitats of smaller size by placing their
              landscape functions and greater vulnerability to disturbance into clearer
              perspective.  Our choice of study system also contributes to the understanding
              of the ecology of estuarine habitats, which are used by juvenile salmon as
              feeding sites during their outmigration to the ocean.
