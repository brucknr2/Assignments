Abstract    :
              9411497  Dacey    Research will be undertaken in response to a one-time Program 
              Announcement (NSF 93-101) for the Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP)  Coastal
              Air-Sea Chemical Fluxes pilot study.  The NSF/CoOP Study  will augment and
              collaborate with the Office of Naval Research  (ONR) -sponsored Marine Boundary
              Layer (MBL) Advanced Research  Initiative (ARI) project scheduled for 1995 off
              the coast of  Monterey, California.  The overall scientific project is 
              interdisciplinary, with the NSF/CoOP efforts addressing chemical  and
              biological parameters, while the ONR study focuses on physical  oceanographic
              and meteorological parameters.     The investigators will focus on the air-sea
              flux of dimethylsulfide  (DMS) and CO2 in coastal ocean.  CO2 and DMS represent
              two of the  most important biogasses in the upper ocean and because of their 
              spectral properties or greenhouse potential, they are important  factors to be
              considered in climate models.  There is a lack of  knowledge concerning CO2 and
              DMS air-sea transfer rates, due  primarily to the inability to measure these
              tracers at high enough  frequency.  A new automated sampling - analysis scheme
              will allow  for a continuous record of DMS and pCO2 concentrations in both 
              surface waters and the overlying atmosphere, as well as in surface  water
              profiles.  This sampling scheme relies heavily on the  development of automated
              instrumentation packages that will  continuously operate for the full
              month-long duration of the field  program.  Data collected will be used in
              conjunction with data from  physical, biological, and chemical projects from
              other  investigators participating in both in CoOP and ONR MBL programs.  
              Ultimately, fundamental questions of biogeochemical ocean  processes, air-sea
              exchange, and atmospheric processes may be  answered to better enable
              validation and calibration of existing  climate models and develop new models
              for predicting local and  global dynamics for these important greenhouse
              gasses.
