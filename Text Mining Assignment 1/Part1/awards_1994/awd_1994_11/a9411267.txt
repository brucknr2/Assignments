Abstract    :
                   This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing  award to study
              uncertain inference.  While there may be a variety  of sources and kinds of
              uncertainty, the kind of uncertainty that  is most pervasive and that should be
              best understood is uncertainty  based on (at least approximate) statistical
              knowledge.  This  project focuses on that kind of uncertainty. There are three
              main  applications of statistical knowledge in planning under  uncertainty; in
              justifying the assumptions we take for granted in  planning and in design, and
              in obtaining and updating statistical  knowledge.  When it comes to making
              these applications under the  special, unique, never-to-be repeated
              circumstances in which we  find ourselves, they are each problematic.  In each
              case the key  concept is that of uncertain inference.  We will characterize 
              uncertain inference, and develop principles that will allow the  formal
              application of statistical knowledge in the presence of rich  and detailed
              knowledge of our unique circumstances.
