Abstract    :
              9411390  Liu    This award supports a research planning visit by Dr. S. Liu, 
              Florida Institute of Technology, and Dr. W. Yang, Tsinghua  University, China
              to develop collaborative research on the  reliability of microelectronic
              packaging and interconnects. VLSI  semiconductor devices continue to utilize
              larger chips (dies) in  progressively smaller packages than previously
              produced.  From  the material and structural point of view, a microelectronic 
              package is a highly complicated composite microlaminate,  consisting of silicon
              chips (dies) and die coatings, various  passivation layers, encapsulant such as
              mold compound, die  attach, leadframe, and various material interfaces. 
              Various  failure modes can occur during fabrication, testing, storage, and 
              operation. For instance, typical failure modes in plastic  packaging include
              metal line smearing, metal and passivation  cracking, die cracking, and various
              material interfacial  delaminations, which are mainly due to elevated
              temperatures and  high moisture concentrations.  The reliability of a
              semiconductor  device is closely related to the mechanical properties of its 
              constituent materials and its associated interfaces.  Therefore,  the first
              part of the proposed research is to conduct  experimental and analytical
              studies on the measurement of the  material response  and the interfacial
              strength for various bi-  material combinations.  The second part of the
              present  investigation involves damage tolerance analysis of packaging  devices
              based on analytical/numerical modeling.  The predicted  results will be
              compared with data obtained form experimental  test chips.
