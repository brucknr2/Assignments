Abstract    :
                                                   9411172  This grant will support a working
              conference entitled "Specific  Language Impairment and Williams' Syndrome: A
              Double Dissociation of  Language and Cognition?", that will bring together
              linguists,  neurolinguists, and clinicians for an intensive week-long working 
              session.  The conference is to be held in conjunction with the  Linguistic
              Institute of the Linguistic Society of America, which will  be held at the
              University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, during July  1995.  The Working
              Conference on "Specific Language Impairment and  Williams' Syndrome: A Double
              Dissociation of Language and Cognition?",  will focus on the theoretical
              implications and clinical realities of  two sharply contrasting developmental
              disorders, Williams' Syndrome  and Specific Language Impairment. It is designed
              to present current  results on these disorders to a much wider audience of
              linguists, and  to bring those linguists into contact with the first-hand
              knowledge of  clinical researchers.
