Abstract    :
              A pressing problem in efforts to improve numerical extended range  weather
              forecasts is to better predict the establishment and  breakdown of persistent
              weather regimes.  While much effort has  been devoted to studying the
              maintenance of these regimes, less is  known about their life cycles.       The
              principal investigator will conduct a comprehensive  diagnostic study of
              weather regime transitions in version 2 of the  Community Climate Model (CCM)
              of the National Center for  Atmospheric Research.  Specifically, the PI will
              attempt to  identify the dynamical and physical mechanisms responsible for 
              regime transitions in the midlatitudes.  The first task will be to  validate
              the statistics, structure and time evolution of persistent  large-scale flow
              anomalies occurring in extended integrations of  the CCM2.  Characteristics of
              the simulated events then will be  compared with observational analyses.  Using
              model "data" allows  the PI to avoid the problems inherent in observational
              studies as  nonconservative processes and secondary circulations which are 
              known explicitly in the model and there are no difficulties with  sparse or
              uncertain observations.  ***
