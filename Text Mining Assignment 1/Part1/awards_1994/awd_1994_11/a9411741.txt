Abstract    :
              9411741  Kolen  The focus of this Minority Research Initiation Planning  Grant
              is to explore the possibility of designing a low cost  non-video based motion
              analysis system that can be used as a  motion analysis tool and/or be
              incorporated as a closed loop  feedback control scheme for prosthetic motion
              control.  By  obtaining the real-time spatial orientation of individual  body
              segments, a computer generated rendering of the whole  body movement is
              available for real-time or post analysis.  There is a large potential
              application for this type of  motion analysis ranging from gait analysis and 
              rehabilitation performance evaluation, through sports  medicine and Olympic
              training.  The specific activity to be  undertaken under this planning grant is
              the preliminary  study of a single two dimensional sensor module.  A follow- 
              on proposal for research to study a complete magneto-  resistive sensor is
              planned for submission.  ***
