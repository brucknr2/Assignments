Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  L. James Lee  CTS-9411462    Researchers from five academic units at
              the Ohio State University:  Chemical Engineering, Engineering Mechanics,
              Mechanical Engineering, Welding Engineering, and Physics, will purchase a
              versatile rehological measurement system which will be dedicated to support
              research in engineering and advanced materials.  This equipment will be used
              for research projects with major emphasis on reactive processing of polymers
              and composites; processing of thermoplastic polymers; rheology of  colloids,
              emulsions, and polymer solutions; joining of polymer and composite structures;
              rheology of  biomaterials; and processing and properties of conducting
              polymers.    These projects are currently supported by NSF, NIH, NIST, DOE,
              ONR, ARPA, TRP Program, the State of Ohio, The Ohio State University and
              various industries.  Rheological measurements of materials in both fluid and
              solid states are essential for these projects.  ***
