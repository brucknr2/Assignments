Abstract    :
              9411212  Tough    The flow of superfluid helium is limited at high velocities by
              a  random tangle of quantized vortex lines that fills the fluid.  In  uniform
              flows, when the tangle is homogeneous, this state of  turbulence is well
              understood both experimentally and  theoretically.  A fundamental microscopic
              theory, supported by  computer simulations, gives many properties of the tangle
              in  excellent agreement with experiments.  It was therefore surprising  when
              preliminary experiments on weakly inhomogeneous superfluid  turbulence gave
              results that cannot be understood as a simple  extension of the homogeneous
              case.  This experimental project  extensive new data on the static and dynamic
              properties of  superfluid turbulence in nonuniform flows where the tangle is 
              inhomogeneous.    % % % %    Understanding and controlling turbulence in the
              flow of fluids is  an important and long-standing problem in science.  From the
               behavior of aircracts and ships, to predicting the weather and  increasing the
              efficiency of flow through pipelines, turbulence  plays a critical role. 
              Enormous progress has been made recently in  understanding a kind of turbulence
              in the simplest fluid:   superfluid turbulence in liquid helium.  A fundamental
              theory gives  results in excellent agreement with experimental observations as 
              long as the turbulence is the same in every part of the fluid.   When the
              turbulence is inhomogeneous however, there are surprising  discrepancies.  The
              experimental project will produce extensive new  data on the properties of
              inhomogeneous superfluid turbulence,  proving a rigorous test of our
              theoretical; understanding.  ***
