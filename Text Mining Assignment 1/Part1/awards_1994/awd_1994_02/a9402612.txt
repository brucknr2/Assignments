Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Chemistry and the International Programs  
              Divisions Donald W. Setser of Kansas State University will pursue   cooperative
              international research with Dr. V. A. Alekseev of the Physics   Research
              Institute of St. Petersburg, Russia to characterize the   spectroscopy and
              kinetics of the states of ClF in the 8.5 to 12 eV energy   range.  Dr. Alekseev
              has extensive experience with vacuum ultraviolet   excitation in this energy
              range, and Dr. Setser has studied similar   species using two-photon laser
              excitation or dc discharges in flow   reactors.  After gaining experience at
              Kansas State, Dr. Alekseev will   return to St. Petersburg and will combine the
              two-photon technique with   one-photon techniques currently used in that
              laboratory.  Specific   species of interest are the B and C states of XeCl made
              by   photodissociation of the precursor van der Waals molecule XeClR (where R  
              is any group) prepared using a pulsed free jet expansion.  %%%  Excimer lasers,
              which are based on rare-gas halide molecules, are   currently used for a wide
              variety of purposes, from cutting and annealing   metals in manufacturing to
              surgery in doctors' offices.  Understanding   the nature of these species could
              impact the development of new laser   sources as well as provide a better
              characterization of existing excimer   lasers to better optimize them.
