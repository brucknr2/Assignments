Abstract    :
              9402572  Goodno  Experimental and analytical investigations of hybrid control 
              systems designed to combine passive damping provided by  cladding-structure
              interaction with robust active control  systems will be continued in this
              second phase of the  overall research.  The research plan is organized into
              three  primary tasks:  (1) development of new low-dimensional  controller
              designs for robust control of building  structures; (2) development of hybrid
              design approaches for  optimization of the combined active (control) and
              passive  (cladding) systems; and (3) experimental verification  through simple
              scale model lab testing.  The principal  products of the proposed research are
              expected to be: (a)  new approaches to designing low-dimensional controllers in
               output feedback settings that can be used for robust control  of building
              structures; (b) integrated design methods for  active/passive control systems
              in which the design process  concurrently optimizes active and passive
              subsystem  properties; (c) modeling, analysis and synthesis procedures  along
              with representative designs which combine advanced  cladding systems with
              several different active control  systems (e.g., active bracing or variable
              stiffness systems)  to form economical hybrid control strategies; (d) 
              development of improved computer models and extension of  present software to
              include consideration of techniques for  hybrid control of buildings using
              architectural cladding;  (e) verification of basic hybrid system behavior
              through  scale model lab experiments.  ***
