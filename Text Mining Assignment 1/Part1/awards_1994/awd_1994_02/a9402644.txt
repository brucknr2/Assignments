Abstract    :
              9402644  Robinson    This dissertation enhancement award supports a 6-month
              research  visit in Japan for Russell Teasley, a graduate student at the 
              University of South Carolina at Columbia, who works under the  direction of
              Professor Richard Robinson.  The research is on a  comparative study of U.S.
              and Japanese interorganizational  technology transfer, focusing on the computer
              integrated  manufacturing industry.  Mr. Teasley will work with Professor 
              Fumio Kodama, Department of Innovation Policy, Saitama  University, Saitama,
              Japan.    The objectives of the research project are to collect data from 
              technology transfer projects in Japanese companies in order to  test the model
              of "technology transfer project effectiveness" and  to evaluate technology
              transfer differences between Japanese and  U.S. companies.  Japanese companies
              were chosen because of their  perceived ability to quickly and effectively
              develop new products  and processes from external, basic-level technologies
              that are  transferred into their organizations.  The computer integrated 
              manufacturing industry was chosen because it experiences a high  level of
              interorganizational exchange between basic research and  engineering
              development.  The results of this study should  contribute to our understanding
              of Japanese management and  cultural practices.
