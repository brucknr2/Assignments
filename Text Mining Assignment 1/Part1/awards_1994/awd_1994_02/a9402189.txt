              University of Missouri - Columbia  PI:  William Mitchell  NCR-9402189      This
              award adds three higher education institutions to the MOREnet state  network:  
                       College of the Ozarks                   Point Lookout          East
              Central College                    Union          Harris-Stowe State College   
                        St. Louis    The new institutions connect to a hub located at the
              University of Missouri  at Columbia.  Faculty and students at the institutions
              benefit from access  to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and
              supercomputers.  In addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate with
              colleagues  at other campuses in pursuit of research and educational projects.
              The  award provides partial support of the project for two years.
