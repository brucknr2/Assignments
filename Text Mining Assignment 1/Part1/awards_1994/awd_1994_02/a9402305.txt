Abstract    :
                   The Bryn Mawr-Spelman Summer Mathematics Program is a six-week summer
              research  program for freshman and sophomore women from Bryn Mawr, Spelman, and
              area colleges, with  the goal of identifying and encouraging talented women to
              pursue careers in the mathematical  sciences.  The program would build on and
              be modeled after a "pre-REU" program that has  taken place at Bryn Mawr for the
              past three summers and would complement the Scholars         in Mathematics
              Program at Spelman.  Eight students would conduct research whose primary  focus
              is experimentation and exploration using the computer; they would be aided by
              alumnae  mentors who are just beginning graduate programs in the mathematical
              sciences.  Other features  of the program include weekly roundtable discussions
              on issues in mathematics research and          teaching, employment as teaching
              assistants in the students' respective departments during the  academic year,
              travel to a national AMS-MAA meeting, encouragement to participate in an REU  
              or summer internship program the following summer, and mentoring and advice
              regarding the  decision to attend graduate school as well as the choice of an
              appropriate graduate program.              The Summer Program will be held for
              the next two years on the campus of Spelman College.   The program builds on
              and complements existing undergraduate programs at both Bryn Mawr  and Spelman
              Colleges and enhances an exchange program between the                  
              colleges  that began in 1984.  It is anticipated that this program would serve
              as a model for other early  intervention and exchange programs at the
              undergraduate level.
