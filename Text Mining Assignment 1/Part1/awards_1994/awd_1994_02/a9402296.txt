Abstract    :
              9402296  Carey       The Pis will investigate the record of the catastrophic 
              floods, known as joekulhlaups, generated by subglacial  eruptions or drainage
              of ice-dammed lakes on Iceland that  cause the introduction of volcaniclastic
              material into the  ocean where it is deposited as turbidites on submarine fan. 
              Samples of land-based joekulhlaup events as well from deep  sea cores will be
              examined.  Oxygen isotopic stratigraphy  will provide chronology. The findings
              will help resolve the  history of flood events and contribute to the modeling
              of  sedimentation around a volcanic hotspot such as Iceland that  is strongly
              influenced by glacial cycles.  ***
