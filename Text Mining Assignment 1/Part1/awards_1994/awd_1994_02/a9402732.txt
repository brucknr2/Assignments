Abstract    :
                   The research covers a number of problems in the area of  billiard dynamical
              systems, differential topology and the theory  of knots. Particular problems
              include the classification of  Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds and the
              classification of  smooth immersed plane curves. Knot invariants arising in
              modern  quantum field theory will also be studied.       The research covers
              several topics which have potential  applications to dynamical and and
              mechanical systems, and some  areas of mathematical physics. Besides the
              mentoring of graduate  students, the investigator's work is partly accessible
              to  undergraduate students. Expository lectures and instruction to  the latter
              are anticipated. Thus the investigator's research  carries an educational
              component which would be in line with the  categories of the current SMET
              initiative.  ***
