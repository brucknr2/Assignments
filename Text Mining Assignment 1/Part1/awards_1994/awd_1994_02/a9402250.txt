Abstract    :
              9402250  Yegian  The use of geosynthetics in geotechnical and geoenvironmental 
              engineering practice continues to grow rapidly, such as in  geomembrane-lined
              canals, reservoirs, hazardous waste containment  and municipal landfills.  The
              response of these geotechnical  structures to dynamic or seismic loading is not
              being adequately  addressed in design or in research.  Recognizing the
              potential  seismic vulnerability of landfills, the 0. Environmental  Protection
              Agency (EPA) has established guidelines, effective  October 1993, requiring
              seismic safety evaluations of all new  landfills.  Hence there is an urgent
              need for improved  understanding of the earthquake response of
              geosynthetic/soil  systems used for seepage control in landfills.    This
              project focuses on the seismic safety of waste containment  and landfills
              structures.  The objectives are to:    1. Understand the dynamic interface
              shear behavior of  geosynthetic/geosynthetic and, more importantly, 
              geosynthetic/soil interfaces.    2. Develop a mathematical model for predicting
              the dynamic  response of simple geosynthetic/soil systems.    3. Validate the
              analytical model by using shaking table test  results.    This research program
              will provide an understanding of the  dynamic response of geosynthetic/soil
              systems; knowledge that is  essential for a rational evaluation of the seismic
              safety of a  geotechnical or a geoenvironmental facility that incorporates 
              geosynthetics, such as a waste containment or a landfill.  ***
