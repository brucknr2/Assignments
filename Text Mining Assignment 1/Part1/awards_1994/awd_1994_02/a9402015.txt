Abstract    :
              9402015 Murthy       The principal investigator will study the structure of 
              projective modules and efficient generation of modules over  affine algebras. 
              He will continue his work on finding  obstructions to splitting of projective
              modules and efficient  generation of ideals, analogous to obstruction theory
              for  sections of vector bundles in topology.  Some of the ingredients  for
              these obstructions are Chow groups.  Other invariants have to  be explored. 
              The tools used are from intersection theory,  algebraic K-theory, and standard
              commutative algebra.               This research is concerned with a number of
              questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry 
              studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One can  either study
              the geometry of the solution set or approach  problems algebraically by
              investigating certain functions on the  solution set that form what is called a
              commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a close connection between
              commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.
