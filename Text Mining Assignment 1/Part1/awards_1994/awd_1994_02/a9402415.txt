Abstract    :
              9402415  Avrunin    The major obstacle to developing automated tools for the
              detection of faults in concurrent software systems is the state explosion
              problem:  the number of possible states of a concurrenet system is, in general,
              exponential in the number of processes making up the system.  but most real
              concurrent software systems remain beyond the reach of existing approaches to
              analysis.    This project would continue the development of an approach to
              analysis based on generating necessary conditions for the existence of certain
              executions of a concurrent system and using integer programming to check the
              consistency of those conditions.  This approach does not require enumeration or
              explicit representation of the states of the system being analyzed, and can be
              used to check such properties as deadlock, starvation, mutual exlusion, and
              minimum and maximum elapsed time between events.  This project includes
              research intended to take advantage of the compositional structure and
              symmetries of a concurrent system and investigates connections with other
              automated analysis methods.  ***
