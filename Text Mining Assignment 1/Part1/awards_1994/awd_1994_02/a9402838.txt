Abstract    :
              9402838  Russell         This project involves analytical and computational
              studies of global (in the state  space) control and stabilization problems for
              the Korteweg - de Vries and related  partial differential equations. Both point
              (boundary) and distributed control modes will  be considered. Advanced
              computational and symbolic processing capabilities will be  employed in the
              investigation of conservation laws for closed loop processes in order  to
              obtain a priori bounds on solutions. This will permit a careful analysis of the
               transients and asymptotic behavior of the controlled system.       Solutions
              of the Korteweg - de Vries, and other, related, nonlinear partial  differential
              equations characteristically include solitary waves, called solitons.  These 
              waves occur in numerous applications, including meteorology and oceanography, 
              fiber-optic signal transmission, chemical transport and diffusion processes,
              and many  others.  Questions of interest which will be addressed by the
              research to be  undertaken in this project include energy attenuation in
              solitary waves, stable creation  of solitary waves, and analysis of repeater
              type amplification of solitary waves. This  research will include both
              mathematical analyses of the processes under investigation  and computer based
              process simulation.
