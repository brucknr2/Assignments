Abstract    :
              9402741  Gumbs    This three-year award supports U.S.-United Kingdom cooperative
               research in materials theory between Godfrey Gumps of Hunter  College of the
              City University of New York (CUNY) and Michael  Pepper of the University of
              Cambridge.  The objective of their  research is to explain theoretically the
              transport properties and  plasmon excitation spectrum of electronic
              microstructures in  spatially confined electronic systems.     The U.S.
              investigator brings to this collaboration theoretical  expertise and will
              compute properties of arrays of quantum  antidots and dots.  These systems
              exhibit novel magnetic field  dependent phenomena and could play a crucial role
              in the next  generation of computers.  Quantum dots have a range of electronic 
              and optical applications. And dots have possibilities as the  basis for more
              efficient and precisely tuned semiconductors. The  theoretical effort is
              complemented by the experimental expertise  of the British research group. Dr.
              Pepper and his colleagues will  fabricate, grow and characterize the
              semiconductor samples and  perform transport and infrared absorption
              experiments.  The  theoretical results obtained at Hunter College will be
              compared  with the experiments.  The proposed research will advance our 
              understanding of these electronic systems and their transport  properties.
