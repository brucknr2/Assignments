Abstract    :
              9402059  Carey    Deep-sea cores provide the basic raw material for studies in 
              paleoceanography, paleoclimatology, sediment dynamics, and chemical 
              oceanography. The curation facilities provide an invaluable service  to the
              marine geology and geophysics and chemical oceanographic  communities.  Funds
              are provided for the continued support for  three years of the core repository
              at URI. These funds will defray  the costs of core handling, description,
              curation, sample  distribution and data management.
