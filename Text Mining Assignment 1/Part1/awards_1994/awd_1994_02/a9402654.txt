Abstract    :
              9402654  Zimmerman    This project connects Tacoma Community College to the
              Internet over  a 56kbps line.  Faculty and students at the schools benefit from
               access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and 
              supercomputers.  In addition, they are able to communicate and  collaborate
              with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of  research and educational
              projects.  The award provides partial  support of the project for two years.
