Abstract    :
                   The primary objective of this project is to extend  logics  that combine
              constructive and classical reasoning in verifying  programs.  The long-term aim
              is to make type-theory-based systems  more  applicable to the kinds of
              programming used in large and  existing systems while  still maintaining the
              power and conceptual  unity of type theory.    The  proposed logic will combine
              a specification language with a  formal logic of  verified programs.  The logic
              will support a wide  spectrum of styles, including  higher-order functions,
              simple and  substructure assignment, and destructive  operations on 
              parameters.    To build the logic, previous work in  mixed-constructive 
              theories is extended, where an evidence-based (constructive) semantics  is 
              augmented by classical operations, as suppressed or oracle  computations.  The
              interactions of the constructive and classical  parts of a proof are limited 
              so that the constructive parts of  the proofs do not depend computationally on 
              the classical parts  of the proofs.  Our work in applicative and simple 
              imperative  versions of such logics show that such logics are natural and 
              robust.  The proposed project will advance the state of knowledge  in the field
               by helping to generate methods for verification that  are better-integrated
              with  the activity of programming.
