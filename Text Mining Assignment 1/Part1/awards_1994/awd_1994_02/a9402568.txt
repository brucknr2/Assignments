Abstract    :
              9402568  Luckett  NYSERNet, Inc. proposes NSFNET connection-assistance for
              adding  the following schools to NYSERNET: New York Institute of  Technology,
              SUNY Health Science Center at Brooklyn, Jewish  Theological Seminary of
              America, and Le Moyne College.  NYSERnet  will connect these colleges to its
              backbone network which in turn  will be connected to an inter-regional service
              provider .  This  new architecture will allow for total networking capabilities
               among the nation's research and education enterprise.    Research, education,
              and access to resources on the NSFNET are  all benefits for connection for
              these participating institutions.   Each has submitted a proposal requesting
              aid through NYSERNet.   Each is presently connected or is awaiting installation
              of a  connection to the network.  Each is committed to supporting the  full
              cost of networking once their subsidy support is concluded.
