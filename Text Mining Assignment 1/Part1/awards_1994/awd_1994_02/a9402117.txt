Abstract    :
              9402117    Eddy, Michael    The preparation of epitaxial TlBaCaCuO (TBCCO) and
              YBa2Cu3O7-8 (YBCO) films has been demonstrated on a small number of substrates.
               At present, LaAlO3 is inert, minimizing interdiffusion between the substrate
              and superconductor and has a good lattice match to the HTS structure.  However,
              there are limitations to its wide-scale use.  The two most significant problems
              are the high dielectric constant (23.5) and twinning.  The most promising
              near-term alternative substrate which does not have these problems is MgO;
              however, growth of high quality TBCCO films on this substrate is difficult.  In
              addition, for YBCO, the quality of the superconductor is degraded relative to
              YBCO on LaAlO3.  MgO will be used as the substrate in Phase II because of the
              thermal expansion match between MgO and the superconductor.
