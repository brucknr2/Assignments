Abstract    :
              9402033  Detrick       This project continues work on a multichannel seismic and
               ocean bottom seismograph study of the southern East Pacific Rise  between the
              Garrett transform and 20 degrees south.  Questions  that will be addressed
              include:  (1) the significance of the  rapid increase in P-wave velocity at the
              base of seismic layer  2A, (2) the physical properties of the melt lens, (3)
              the  dimensions and physical properties of the low velocity volume in  mid and
              lower crust beneath the axial magma chamber, (4) the  nture of Moho in the
              axial region, and (5) the variation in axial  crustal structure across an
              overlapping spreading center.  ***
