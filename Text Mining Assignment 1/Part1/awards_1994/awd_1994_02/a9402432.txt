Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase II research addresses a computational environment for optimal
              dimensional management of components and assemblies.  The approach couples a
              genetic optimization method with a Monte Carlo based tolerance test.  Both
              tolerance ranges and nominal dimensions are included as design variables.  The
              goal is to generate the minimum cost assembly which meets all  design and
              manufacturing considerations, which may be formed as constraints or as multiple
              objectives.  Successful application of the technology will dramatically reduce
              product development times and manufacturing cost.    Current tolerance analysis
              software does not allocate tolerances or modify nominal dimensions in an
              optimal fashion.  Traditional nonlinear programming methods are insufficiently
              robust to solve the highly nonlinear, multimodal problem resulting from the
              consideration of a "real" component or assembly.  The combination of  the
              genetic algorithm with a tolerance analysis package has the advantage of 
              efficient  operation on a parallel or distributed computing network.  This
              research is directed  toward increasing algorithmic efficiency and reliability
              for both the genetic optimized and the tolerance model simulation.
