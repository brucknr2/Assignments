Abstract    :
              Jordan             This award funds the research of Professor Bruce Jordan  into
              the Hecke structure of Shimura varieties.  Recent advances  in crystalline
              cohomology make it possible to control the action  of inertia on p-adic
              cohomology groups of varieties over  unramified extensions with good reduction
              over the rational  p-adic field.  Prof. Jordan expects to apply these
              techniques to  Shimura varieties.             This is research in the field of
              arithmetic algebraic   geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of
              algebraic   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,  
              algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the   plane by the
              simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number   theory started with the whole
              numbers and such questions as   divisibility of one whole number by another.
              These two subjects,  seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other
              from   the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual  
              influence has increased greatly. The result has been an increased 
              understanding of both areas of mathematics. ***
