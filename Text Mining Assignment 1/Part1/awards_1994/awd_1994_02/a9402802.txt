Abstract    :
              9402802  Kawiecki  The objective of this project is to develop an approach to 
              control torsional and torsional-bending vibrations in  structural elements. 
              This problem will be solved using two  methods. One of the methods is based on
              a concept of  generating torsional, bending and axial control loads using  the
              extension/compression action of piezoceramic elements  distributed over the
              structural element. The other method is  based on a concept of improving the
              damping characteristics  of a structure by using a piezofilm to modify the 
              distribution of shear strain in a viscoelastic layer bonded  to a structure.
              The project involves experimental and  numerical investigations. The
              experimental research will be  performed with three different specimentss: (1)
              a composite  beam with an embedded set of piezoelements designed to  generate
              torsional and bending control loads, (2) a thin  walled aluminum beam with a
              set of piezoelements laminated  to the walls, and (3) a thin-walled aluminum
              beam with a set  of ACLD elements laminated to its walls.  In the analytical 
              work, a finite element code capable of modeling the dynamics  of the beams will
              be developed.  The research plan is  formulated to allow the correlation of the
              results obtained  at each step to code development with the results obtained 
              at each corresponding step of the experimental  investigation.  In the control
              experiments, the  piezoelements bonded to the beams will be driven by a simple 
              analog control system based on proportional and derivative  control gains.  The
              attenuation effectiveness of torsional  bending vibrations will be tested. 
              Eventually, the same  system will be used to control finite element models. 
              The  degree of correlation with real system behavior will allow  the evaluation
              of the accuracy of the numerical model.  ***
