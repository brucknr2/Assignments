Abstract    :
              9402118  Mislove       This award supports a conference on semigroup theory and
              its  applications to be held at Tulane University this spring.  The  impetus
              for the conference is to commemorate the contributions of  Professor Alfred H.
              Clifford, who played a fundamental role in  the development of semigroup
              theory.  The object of the  conference is to identify the state of the theory
              of semigroups  at this time, and to look forward by identifying those areas of 
              research where semigroup theory can play an important role.              This
              award is in the area of semigroups.  A semigroup is one  of the simplest of the
              abstract mathematical structures,  consisting of a set with one associative
              operation on it.  The  structure of these very general objects will be
              investigated.   Applications will be given to various areas of mathematics and 
              computer science.
