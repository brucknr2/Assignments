Abstract    :
              Kuniholm    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Kuniholm will  continue
              to develop a dendrochronological sequence for Southern  Europe and the Near
              East. To date he has collected sections of  sequences which extend back to ca.
              7,500 BC and which cover major  portions of Turkey, Greece, Italy and adjacent
              areas in  Southeastern Europe. With partial NSF support he will continue  this
              work. Over the course of two field seasons, together with  his colleagues, he
              will visit numerous sites in the region to  collect old wood. Analysis at
              Kuniholm's Cornell laboratory will  then permit their incorporation into a
              master chronology. The  goals of this work are to fill in the gaps which remain
              in the  chronology and to fill in its extended range.    This research is
              important for several reasons. Most importantly,  from an archaeological
              perspective, a tree ring chronology will  provide an absolute dating technique
              which will allow dates to be  assigned to wood and charcoal recovered from
              archaeological  sites. Precise dating is critical in such research. The 
              information will also be useful to paleoecologists,  climatologists and others
              who use data derived from the past. The  tree ring chronology will not only
              provide a basis to increase  our understanding of past human behavior, but will
              also help to  illumine such issues as the effect of human actions on climate.
