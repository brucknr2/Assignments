Abstract    :
              9402315  Somerville  The powdery mildew disease of barley, caused by the
              obligate fungal  pathogen Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei, offers several
              advantages  for the study of host genes mediating resistance.  This disease has
               been studied intensively for more that 50 years; thus, there is an  extensive
              base of physiological data and genetic materials  available that is unmatched
              by most other host/pathogen systems.   The barley Ml-a locus is of particular
              interest in that more that  30 resistance alleles have been identified at this
              locus.  By  screening 118,000 M2 seedlings, I have isolated 41 partially or 
              fully susceptible mutants.  Complementation analysis of these new  alleles will
              be used to determine the genetic structure of the Ml-a  locus, which may
              represent either a complex locus or cluster of  tightly linked genes.  Also,
              the mutants will be exploited in  subtractive hybridization experiments to
              isolated Ml-a cDNA clones.   No such disease resistance gene has been cloned
              form any plant.  %%%  Analysis of the Ml-a clones will provide information
              about the  nature of the allelic variation at the Ml-a locus and about the 
              biochemical role of the Ml-a gene product in mediating disease  resistance.
