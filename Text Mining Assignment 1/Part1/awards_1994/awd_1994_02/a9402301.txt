Abstract    :
              9402301   Ellis  A group of six science and technology centers across the
              country  proposes to form a pilot collaborative effort to establish 
              connections to NSFNET.  These institutions share the vision that  access to the
              resources provided via NSFNET will significantly  enhance their ability to
              achieve their common missions and goals in  providing informal science
              education for students, teachers, and  the general public.  Further, it is
              expected that this group of  institutions will serve as a model for other
              museums and represents  the vanguard in what will become a general movement for
              science and  technology centers to become full participants in this national 
              communication network.    The partner institutions of this collaboration are:
              The Franklin  Institute (PA), Liberty Science Center (NJ), Museum of Science 
              (MA), Center of Science and Industry (OH), Oregon Museum of Science  and
              Industry (OR), St. Louis Science Center (MO), The Science Place  (TX).   
              Connection to NSFNET will bring a wide range of remote information  resources
              within immediate reach of museum researchers, educators,  and visitors. 
              Specifically, access to the NSFNET will help the  partners of this pilot group
              to improve operations in the areas of  teaching, research, and service.
