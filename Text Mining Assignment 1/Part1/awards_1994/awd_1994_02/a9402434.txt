Abstract    :
              9402434  Hickey         This three year award is for continuation and expansion
              of  studies related to the effects of gravity waves on the minor  species'
              densities and associated nightglow emissions of the  mesopause/lower
              thermosphere (MLT) region.  For a given mean state  and set of gravity wave
              parameters, the characteristics of the  emission fluctuations will depend on
              the chemical pathways involved  in the emission process.  By careful modeling,
              the characteristics  of the oxygen emission fluctuations using several
              different  chemical pathways that have been proposed to explain the emissions 
              will be investigated.  Preliminary analyses have shown that obvious 
              differences exist in the emission fluctuations for the different  possible
              chemical pathways involved.  By expanding these analyses,  it will be possible
              to search for signatures in the emission  fluctuations that are peculiar to
              each of the different chemical  pathways.  The theoretical development will be
              followed by  extensive diagnostic analysis of both ground-based and space-based
               emission data, searching for the prognostic signatures, and  deducing the
              chemical pathways involved.  ***
