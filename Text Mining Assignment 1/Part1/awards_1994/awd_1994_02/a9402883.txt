Abstract    :
               This project investigates the introduction of ambitious program  analysis and
              program restructuring techniques into automatic  program  optimization systems,
              with the goal of significantly  improving the quality of  code produced by
              compilers for modern  computer architectures.  Although a  variety of compiler 
              optimization techniques exist, they are not used to their  full extent in
              production compilers because, the analysis and  transformations are
              computationally intensive.  In addition, the  information  obtained by analyses
              must be maintained and updated  across the various compiler  passes and program
              transformations.    The project relies on the previous work  on ``sparse'' 
              data flow frameworks and explores three methods for  overcoming  the current
              limitations to using ambitious program analyses in  production compilers: (1)
              decomposing a dense data flow framework into an  interconnected set of sparse
              data flow frameworks, (2) selectively computing  and using costly information
              on behalf  of a particular program optimization.  and (3) integrating program
              analysis and transformation.
