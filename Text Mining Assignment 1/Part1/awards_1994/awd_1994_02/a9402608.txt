Abstract    :
              9402608  Krishnamurty  In this research project, a unified scheme is developed
              for the  design of generic mechanisms using an exact gradient approach.  The
              utilization of this approach enhances the efficiency of  the mechanism design
              process, and the accuracy of the final  solution. It includes a comprehensive
              design procedure for  determining and eliminating branch-defects and circuit
              defects  during mechanism synthesis process leading to optimal solutions  for
              complex mechanisms. The unified approach uses matrix methods  to model and
              analyze mechanisms to ensure generality, and has the  capabilities of
              systematically determining suitable mechanism  types and their optimal
              dimensions without branch and circuit  defects. The results of this research
              are extremely useful in the  mechanism identification and enumeration process,
              formulation of  appropriate selection and rejection criteria for mechanism 
              evaluation, and designing and implementing schemes for automatic  mechanism
              sketching  without crossing links, and representing  different class of
              mechanism such as contracted graphs and  kinematic chains.  ***
