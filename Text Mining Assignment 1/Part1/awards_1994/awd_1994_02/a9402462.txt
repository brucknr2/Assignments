Abstract    :
              9402462  Gorringe  Fundamental properties of the electro-weak interaction will
              be  measured via the muon-nucleon capture reaction.  Specifically,  coupling
              constants for the various components of the interaction  in nuclear systems are
              not known well enough to constrain theory.  In addition, medium effects may
              alter the strong interaction  correction to the elemental interaction via meson
              exchange  currents, isobar excitations, and nucleon structure. 
              Correspondingly, muon capture measurements will be carried out in  hydrogen and
              in complex nuclei, as well as needed ancillary  experiments.  This work will be
              done at the TRIUMF lab in Canada.  ***
