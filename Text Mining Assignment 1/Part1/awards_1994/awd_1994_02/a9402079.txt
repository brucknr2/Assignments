Abstract    :
              9402079  Brannon-Peppas  This is a PHASE II Small Business Innovation Research
              (SBIR)  project.    Biodegradable microparticles are being studied for use in a
               wide variety of drugs as a means to deliver the drug in the  body in a
              controlled manner. A significant obstacle to the  use of microparticles is
              their tendency to settle quickly in  commonly used injection carrier materials
              such as saline.  The settling makes it difficult to administer the entire 
              injection volume of microparticles, and also the  microparticles have a
              tendency to clump in the needle of the  syringe, when injection becomes
              impossible.    This Phase II investigation involves the development of 
              technologies by which biodegradable microparticles  containing drugs would be
              surface treated so they remain  suspended in aqueous media for long periods. As
              a result of  studies conducted in the Phase I investigation, the Phase II 
              study will focus  the direction of the surface treatment so  as to produce the
              greatest results with the least pote
