Abstract    :
                            This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award to
               investigate how to exploit disfluencies in spoken language dialog  systems and
              also how to enhance the ability of computerized dialog  systems to handle
              disfluencies.  In the first task the decision of  what parts of the diffluent
              dialog should be edited or retained is  studied as well as its influence in
              anticipating the speakers'  planning problems.  In the second task the
              investigation centers on  the systems' ability to utilize multimodal feedback
              adapted from  conversation to repair misinterpretations arising from 
              disfluencies.  Additionally, corpora is analyzed with the objective  of
              establishing a dialogic evaluation metric for spoken language  systems which
              incorporates the system's ability to recover from  faults.
