Abstract    :
              9402854  Leadbetter        Travel support and expenses are requested for the
              participation of at  least 24 promising junior researchers and graduate
              students in the 3rd World  Congress of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical
              Statistics and Probability,  which is to be held jointly with the 57th Annual
              Meeting of the Institute of  Mathematical Statistics (IMS).        The
              Bernoulli Society schedules a 4-year "World Congress for Probability  and
              Mathematical Statistics", which is an integral component of the  infrastructure
              for scholarly exchange of ideas on an international level.  It  plays a role in
              the fields of probability and mathematical statistics similar  to that of the
              International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in the field of  mathematics.   
                  The Congress was last held in 1990 in Uppsala, Sweden, jointly with the 
              53rd annual meeting of the IMS. (The IMS and Bernoulli Society are the two 
              principal international organizations for Mathematical Statistics and 
              Probability.) This enormously successful conference provided strong 
              encouragement to the societies to consider further joint meeting, designating 
              Chapel Hill, NC (site of the University of North Carolina) as venue for the 
              next Congress scheduled for June 19-25, 1994.        The Congress is expected
              to attract up to 800 participants including  many internationally recognized
              statisticians and probabilists.  The  Organizing Committee desires to encourage
              the attendance and significant  involvement of promising junior researchers and
              graduate students, and has  instituted a  "Host/Mentor" program to pair junior
              participants with  established researchers.  This is designed to ensure their
              introduction to,  and instigate significant interactions with talented senior
              and foreign  statisticians and probabilists at the meeting.        The Congress
              Program emphasizes probability and statistical theory and  application with
              eleven invited sessions in Probability, thirteen in  Statistical Theory and
              eleven on Applications.  In add ition, a number of  related workshops and
              special lectures are planned.
