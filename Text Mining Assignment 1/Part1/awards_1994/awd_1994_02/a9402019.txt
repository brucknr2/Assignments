Abstract    :
              9402019  ANDERSON      During their travel in the inner solar system, fine
              cosmic dust  particles acquire large amounts of noble gases owing to their 
              surface to volume ratio.  When these particles enter the earth's  atmosphere,
              those sufficiently small to enter the earth's  atmosphere at cosmic velocities
              without suffering ablation, are  called micrometeorites and retain their noble
              gases, including He.   Not only do the micrometeorites have high He
              concentrations, but  they also have very high 3He/4He ratios, several orders of
               magnitude above that of terrigenous materials. The micrometeorites  eventually
              settle down to the bottom of the ocean where they are  mixed with other
              sediments. This project will use the bulk sediment  He concentration and
              isotopic composition as a measure of  micrometeorite concentration in the
              sediments. If the flux of  micrometeorites to the earth has remained constant
              in geological  past, then their concentration in sediments can be used to 
              quantitatively evaluate sedimentation rates and the fluxes of  different
              sedimentary components and changes in these fluxes  through time.  This
              research will test the assumptions that the  flux of micrometeorites to the
              sediments have stayed constant over  time and that the micrometeorites in
              sediments retain their He for  time-scales of interest. If successful, this
              approach will expand  our ability to look at high resolution sedimentation
              rates to  millions of years.
