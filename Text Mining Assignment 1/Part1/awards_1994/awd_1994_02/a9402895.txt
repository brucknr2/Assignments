Abstract    :
              9402895  Komanduri  The award is for the development of an integrated approach
              to the  design of equipment for precision finishing of advanced ceramics  and
              glasses based on the magnetic field assisted polishing  technique. 
              Experimental and analytical approaches will be taken to  develop the science
              base for the design, construction, and  optimization of the equipment used for
              the polishing.  Finite-  element based techniques will be used to help select
              specific  magnetic field configurations, and optimization of process 
              parameters will be based on studies of relationships between  process
              parameters and various measures of process performance.  A  database relating
              process parameters and process performance will  be developed.         The
              finishing techniques to be developed here can be used  successfully for
              efficient finishing of a variety of materials both  magnetic and non-magnetic,
              as material removal rates are at least  an order of magnitude higher than
              conventional polishing  techniques.  The analytical techniques developed here
              will  facilitate design and optimization of the equipment without  reliance on
              trial and error as is currently the case.
