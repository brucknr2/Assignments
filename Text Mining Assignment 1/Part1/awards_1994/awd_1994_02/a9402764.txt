Abstract    :
              9402764  Holzworth         The objectives of this proposal are threefold:  (1)
              to  determine ionospheric convection patterns in polar cap, auroral  zone and
              midlatitudes from stratospheric balloon-borne  electrodynamic measurements; (2)
              to determine long and short term  variability of global circuit; and (3) to
              evaluate the importance  of stratospheric and tropospheric electric field
              sources to  inferred ionospheric convection.  The research will address 
              problems at the foot-of-the-field lines for ISTP/GGS satellites.   The balloon
              program's overall goal is to better understand the  structure and dynamics of
              the magnetosphere.  It will play an  essential role in providing new data to
              the problem where neither  satellites nor radars can provide the high time
              resolution, long  duration and multiple simultaneous data points now available
              with  the PIs data set.  ***
