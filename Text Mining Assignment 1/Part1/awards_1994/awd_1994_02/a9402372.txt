Abstract    :
              PIs will reconstruct the history of changes in the intensity of  equatorward
              winds over NE Pacific since the last climatic optimum  9 K.y. ago.  These data
              will serve to test the general circulation  models of the past climate that
              suggests that upwelling-favorable  winds have weakened since the last climatic
              optimum due to decline  in the summer insolation over northern Hemisphere. 
              Dissolved  cadmium concentrations in foraminiferal shells will be used as 
              proxy for upwelling in core from estuaries in Humboldt and Coos  Bays, NW
              United States.
