Abstract    :
              9402548  Colton         This the quality-control portion of a major study of the
               Russian legislative elections, sending scientifically-trained  monitors to the
              areas in the Russian Federation where surveys are  administered to random
              samples of voters.  Not only does their  work greatly increase the scientific
              quality of the data  collected, but it also provides valid measures of the
              variable  quality of data from one research site to another.  The resulting 
              data set will offer deep understanding of the processes of  democratization and
              radicalization currently in progress in  Russia.  For example, the survey
              collects rich data about the  individual and social characteristics that lead
              to support for  the competing political parties.  %%%       This research will
              test competing theories of the factors  that promote or impede transition from
              authoritarian to  democratic systems of government, and of the social courses
              of  political radicalism.  If the United States is to navigate  successfully
              the ocean of problems and opportunities that lie  ahead in its relations with
              Russia and other nations of the  former Soviet Union, we will need far more
              complete and accurate  scientific information than currently exists about the
              factors  that facilitate or destroy democracy.  In addition, this grant  will
              strengthen ties between American social scientists and their  colleagues in
              Russia.    ***
