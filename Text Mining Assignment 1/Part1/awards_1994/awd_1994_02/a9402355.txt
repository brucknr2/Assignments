Abstract    :
              9402355  Reichert  The research proposed in this application addresses 
              engineering and materials aspects of assembling integrated  optical waveguide
              immunosensors.  As presented,  immunochemistry, coupled with novel optical
              detection  phenomena, is a powerful approach to in situ biosensing  problems. 
              This work develops thin film integrated optical  waveguide fluoroimmunosensors
              with:  (1) increased  sensitivity to ultra-low analyte concentrations, and (2)
              the  ability to perform multi-analyte detection on a single chip  device that
              can be mass produced inexpensively in large  quantities.  The novel aspect of
              the work is not the  production of multichannel waveguide, grating coupled 
              waveguides  or thin film waveguide immunosensors.  The  innovation is combining
              these three technologies to produce  a multichannel, grating coupled, thin film
              immunosensor, and  making them with optical properties in a manner that is 
              fully process oriented.  ***
