Abstract    :
              9402161  Pitnick    This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Scott Pitnick of
              Arizona  State University in a research collaboration with Prof. Edward 
              Pfeiler of the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de  Monterrey,
              Guaymas campus.  The investigators intend to use  allozyme variability of four
              cactophilic Drosophila species,  endemic to the Sonoran Desert, to characterize
              the genetic  structure of all four species and to compare the genetic structure
               of each species at different seasons in the context of resource  availability.
               They will also examine the relationship between  genotype and differential
              tolerance to thermal extremes.    The four Drosophila species endemic to the
              Sonoran Desert have been  an important model for studies of ecological
              genetics.  Their  usefulness, however, has been limited by the lack of
              knowledge of  the genetic structure of these populations and how genetic 
              structure varies with resource availability and with season.  The  proposed
              work, through complementary use of facilities and  expertise, will increase our
              understanding of the field.  ***
