Abstract    :
              9402130  Mehra   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
              develops and tests a prototype hardware/software system for closed loop control
              of part surface temperatures and mold interior temperatures in injection
              molding operations.  In the Phase I feasibility stage infrared sensors were
              demonstrated successfully to provide the sensory input to a closed loop control
              system.  the Phase II prototype will use both remote infrared thermometers and
              weight sensors.  An industrial partner will support the Phase II effort with
              in-kind contributions   This process control technology is expected to find
              extensive application in both retrofit and new equipment markets for the
              plastic injection molding industry.
