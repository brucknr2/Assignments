Abstract    :
              9402227  Bock    The dynamics of wind-generated capillary gravity waves and the 
              impact of surface films on the generation and evolution of these  waves will be
              studied by analyzing the results of a extensive  laboratory experiment.  The
              analysis will be focussed on both the  stationary stage of the wave spectrum at
              different wind speeds and  surfactant concentration and the unsteady response
              of the wave  field to abrupt change in wind speed.
