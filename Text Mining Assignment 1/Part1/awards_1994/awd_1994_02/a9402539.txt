Abstract    :
              9402539  Gilbert  The research seeks to investigate direct and inverse acoustic 
              problems in shallow oceans.  The approach would be to use  homogenization to
              derive the deterministic and stochastic  differential equations for the ocean
              seabed system.  There are  several open problems still associated with the
              deterministic  problem such as a correct formulation of the farfield, the 
              unidentified inclusion problem, and for that matter, the proof of  the
              existence of the fundamental singular solution and an  efficient computational
              method for finding it.    The homogenization approach produces the
              deterministic model as  the zero order term and the first order takes in the
              random  nature of the media by proposing a stochastic differential  equation. 
              The research is aimed at studying this stochastic  differential equation and to
              pose and investigate the random  inverse problems associated with it.  ***
