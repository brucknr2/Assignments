Abstract    :
              9402922  Sparks    In this project the PIs will investigate magma migration and 
              various scales of mantle flow. They will perform 2- and 3-D  numerical
              modelling to address questions concerned with melt  channelling and focusing.
              They will use a time-efficient gridding  technique (Fast Adaptive Composite
              gridding) to obtain high  resolution at various scales that may be needed.
