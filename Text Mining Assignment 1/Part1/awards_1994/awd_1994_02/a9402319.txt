Abstract    :
               9402319  Crawford  The proposed cross-disciplinary (pharmacy and engineering) 
              study will examine the impact of robotics technology in  pharmacy practice. 
              This Planning Grant activities will  include development of a statistically
              based simulation  model of the unit-dose medication cart filling process fop a 
              hospital pharmacy department.  Activities will also include  examination of
              attitudes about the utilization of robotics  technology in pharmacy practice. 
              %%%  The PI has been trained in the field of Pharmacy  Administration, and not
              trained in the area of process  simulation and modeling-a  component of the
              planned  proposal.  A senior investigator is listed within the  planning grant
              with a specialty in process simulation and  modeling.  This senior investigator
              will serve as a mentor  to allow the PI to develop an expertise in the process 
              simulation and modeling within the 12 month period allotted  to the planning
              grant.  ***
