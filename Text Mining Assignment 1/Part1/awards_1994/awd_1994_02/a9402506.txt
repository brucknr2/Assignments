Abstract    :
              9402506  Graham       This project will analyze the He isotopes in rocks
              collected  from three parts of the mid-ocean ridge system--the East Pacific 
              Ridge, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and an area of the Southeast  Indian Ridge.  The
              isotopes will be compared with other  geochemical and geophysical parameters
              from these areas, to  address a set of questions concerning the variability of
              mantle  magmas.  ***
