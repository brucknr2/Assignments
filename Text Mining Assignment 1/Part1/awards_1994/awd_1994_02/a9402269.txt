Abstract    :
              9402269  Mendillo         In this proposal, the PI defines a new diagnostics
              capability  for the CEDAR community in which the two dimensional structures can
               be obtained within the context of an all-sky spectrally  monochromatic image. 
              The CEDAR Tomography Facility (COTIF) would  thus bring, literally, the third
              dimension to optical aeronomy over  the full altitude domain of mesosphere to
              thermosphere (80-600 km)  defined by such emission features as metallic layers
              to SAR arcs.    The proposed effort is for two years, using a team of
              researchers  experienced in the design, construction and science yield of 
              optical diagnostics.  Science Team members from other institutions  provide
              advice and guidance on final design goals, field test  issues and full off-site
              campaign use.  Automation, telescience  access and super-computer utilization
              offer extraordinary  opportunities for CEDAR post-doctoral and graduate student
              training  in a first of its kind tomographic facility.  ***
