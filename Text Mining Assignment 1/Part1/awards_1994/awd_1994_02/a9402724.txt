Abstract    :
                    9402724  BARSNESS  The  goals of this dissertation project are to analyze
              the nature  of  social  and culture change, and the conditions that constrain 
              and  promote these changes. The study, based on ethnographic  and  archival 
              analysis,  focuses on alterations  that  have  occurred  during  the  past  50 
              years in the Tlingit  village  of  Hoonah,  Alaska.  It  is proposed that these
              changes were the  results  of  events beyond village control as well as
              deliberate decisions  by  village leaders. Furthermore, it is suggested that
              social  change  may be deliberately created by members of a society as a means
              to  generate  political power. The project will fill a major  gap  in  our
              knowledge of contemporary Native American social organization  and   contribute
                to  anthropological  knowledge   of   cultural  transformation.  ***
