Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT  CTS-9402911  Grigoropoulos     The proposed research focuses on
              the application of pulsed laser sputtering for selective removal of material
              from a surface and for the deposition of thin films.  The physical mechanisms
              of laser-induced ablative material removal, as a function of their dependence
              on the laser fluence, wavelength, pulse duration, the target material
              properties, and the properties of the background fluid environment will be
              studied.  In addition, the mechanisms of ablative material removal and the
              speed and motion of the ejected particles will be determined through modeling
              and numerical simulations.  Finally, the practical aspects of laser sputtering
              will be investigated and optimized by controlling and redirecting the induced
              flow and rejecting heavy clusters.  As a result of this work, the use of novel
              applications will be enhanced through a better understanding of laser ablation,
              especially for thin film materials.
