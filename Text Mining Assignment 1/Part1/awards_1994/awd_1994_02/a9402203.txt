Abstract    :
              9402203  Miller    Surface Characterization of Adsorption and Interfacial
              Reactions  is the title of the proposed Engineering Foundation Conference.  
              Representatives from academia, industry, and government will  participate in
              this conference to be held January 9-14, 1994.   An international audience is
              expected.  In particular, numerous  researchers from Pacific Rim and European
              countries have already  committed to participating in the conference.    The
              conference has multiple objectives.  First, to convene a  truly
              multi-disciplinary group of top quality researchers from  academia, industry
              and government to consider advances in  surface characterization of adsorption
              and interfacial  reactions.  Second, to provide a broad based forum for these 
              researchers to aid in cross-fertilization of their current  findings and ideas.
               In particular, the Conference will focus on  utilization of new surface
              science technologies in the areas of  biomaterials, natural
              resources/environment, and materials  fabrication.    Support is requested for
              transportation, lodging, and  registration costs of invited U.S. speakers at
              the Conference.   It should be noted that only modest NSF support will be
              required  to augment substantial support already committed by industrial 
              sponsors.  ***
