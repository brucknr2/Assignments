Abstract    :
              This  U.S.- Brazil Cooperative Science Program award  supports  travel expenses,
               computer time and publication  costs, related to the visit of J. T. Oden,  U.
              of Texas,  Austin to  Belo Horizonte, Brazil.  Prof. Oden will  work on 
              numerical analysis of thermal shakedown problems;  his  Brazilian counterpart
              is J. Franco, of the Federal  University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte.  An
              important objective in solid mechanics is to determine  conditions under which
              mechanical and  structural systems  fail.  Limit load analysis, particularly
              shakedown theory of  classical plasticity  is one of the ways  in which these 
              conditions may be determined.   The present work involves  the  development of
              a new and general theory of failure  analysis, extending classical shakedown
              theories,  that  focuses on the following: -general material constitutive laws,
              including possibly  non-  ductile materials, -upper and lower bounds for limit
              and shakedown loads,-variable multiple-  parameter load factors,-inclusion of
              the effects of thermal cyclic loading on material behavior,     -development of
              computational schemes to determine bounds on limit and shakedown loads,    
              -development of schemes for numerical error estimations and adaptivity to
              control the  computational process and  produce very accurate simulations of
              failure mechanisms and  limit loads, -comparisons with available data,
              experimental, computational and analytical.
