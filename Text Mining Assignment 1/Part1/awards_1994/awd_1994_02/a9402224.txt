Abstract    :
              9402224  Foutch, Douglas A.    The main objective of this research is to provide
              experimental  data and analytical results that will significantly improve 
              current practice of evaluation, rehabilitation and design of  railway bridges. 
              The program will involve a cooperative effort  among researchers from the
              Association of American Railroads and  the University of Illinois.    Field
              tests will be conducted to determine the loading spectra  that railway bridges
              under current operating conditions.  Analytical studies will compare measured
              and calculated member  strains.  New models for evaluating the remaining life
              of  existing riveted steel bridges will be developed.  These are  essential for
              the sound management of the existing bridge stock  and will assist the
              railroads in making important decisions  regarding the investment of capital
              funds.  The research results  will help to improve the competitiveness of
              American railroads.  ***
