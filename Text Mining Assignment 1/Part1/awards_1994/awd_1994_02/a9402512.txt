Abstract    :
              9402512  Landsberger  This award supports dissertation-related research in
              Western Europe  by a PhD student of Dr. Sheldon Landsberger from the University
              of  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  The graduate student, Mr. Steven  Biegalski,
              will carry out atmospheric chemistry research at the RISO  National Laboratory
              in Roskilde, Denmark.  Dr. Landsberger and Mr.  Biegalski are actively involved
              in research using source-receptor  models to characterize the airborne
              pollutants in the Arctic and also  to study the influence that halogens have on
              the destruction of  ozone.  Dr. Landsberger has received funding from Denmark
              to visit  and collaborate with Dr. K. Heydorn and Dr. Kare Kemp of the Neils 
              Bohr Institute.  They are directing a Danish project to develop  receptor
              models based on analyses of Arctic aerosols.    Funding from the Western Europe
              Program of NSF will enable Mr.  Biegalski to accompany Dr. Landsberger and to
              stay for two two-month  periods to carry out research that will contribute to
              his  dissertation.  Participation in the ongoing research at RISO National 
              Laboratory will give Mr. Biegalski access to field samples and  specialized
              equipment and procedures not available to him at the  University of Illinois. 
              These will give him further insights into  the role that the long range
              transport of atmospheric aerosols,  particularly trace elements, play in global
              change.  He will also  gain experience in international collaboration at an
              early stage of  his research career, and establish solid professional contacts
              with a  leading atmospheric chemistry research group and its network of 
              European collaborators.  ***
