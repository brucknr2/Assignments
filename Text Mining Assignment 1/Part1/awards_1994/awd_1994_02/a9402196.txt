Abstract    :
              9402196  Soong  The objective of this joint research program with  researchers
              in PRC is the full-scale implementation of  passive and active control
              technology to structures against  wind and earthquake loads.  While several
              structures in PRC  are being considered for structural control, the focus of 
              the project is on the Nanjing Tower, which has been chosen  not only for
              control implementation but also as a test-bed  where multiple systems will be
              installed and their  performances observed, analysized and compared.  During
              the  first phase of this project the research, development and  installation of
              suitable control systems for the Nanjing  Tower will be carried out in
              collaboration with PRC  researchers.  The systems under consideration include
              tuned  liquid dampers, viscoelastic dampers, and tuned, semi-  active, and
              hybrid mass dampers.    One of the direct benefits to the structural control 
              research community derived from this joint research program  is new information
              about some of the important  implementational issues in connection with
              structural  control. Some of the issues to be addressed in the second  phase of
              this project include: system optimization, fail-  safe measures, reliability
              and maintenance, operational  issues, diagnostics, and cost benefit analysis.
