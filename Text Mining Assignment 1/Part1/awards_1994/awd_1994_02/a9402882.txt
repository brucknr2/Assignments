Abstract    :
                  A class of cells found in the nervous system, though not nerve  cells
              themselves is called glia, from their early presumed adhesive  glue-like role
              to hold cells together.  These glial  cells are now  known  to be important for
              many aspects of normal function in the  brain.  Glial cells and their
              associated products participate in  fundamental interactions which underline
              the development and  organization of the nervous system.  Insects are widely
              used as  model system for development, and in insects the first antigen 
              associated with glial cells was a glycoprotein compound called  glionexin or
              GX, identified in the cricket.  Features of its  distribution, spatial and
              temporal expression, and preliminary  functional tests suggested GX is involved
              in neural development as  an adhesion/recognition molecule.  This work uses
              antibody probes  and microsequence analysis to screen genetic cDNA libraries
              from  embryonic crickets and adult Drosophila flies, where we have a lot  of
              genetic information, to isolate and sequence the gene encoding  GX. 
              Identification of the gene will allow new tests for function  of this compound,
              which in turn will be important for understanding  the complex interactions
              that guide nerve cell outgrowth during  development and regeneration.  The work
              may lead to better  understanding of the evolution of cell adhesion
              macromolecules, and  will have impact on developmental biology as well as
              neuroscience.
