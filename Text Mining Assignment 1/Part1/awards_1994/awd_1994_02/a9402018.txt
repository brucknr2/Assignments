Abstract    :
              9402018  Mifflin    The proposed research concerns developing a way to combine 
              polyhedral and quadratic approximation to produce a rapidly  convergent
              algorithm for minimizing a nonsmooth function of  several variables.  The idea
              is to combine bundle and proximal  point methods to determine a space
              decomposition such that on one  subspace the cutting-plane aspect of bundling
              works well and on  the other subspace a quasi-Newton approximation of a certain
               reduced Hessian can be employed.    This research can be applied in many
              practical decision-making  situations. These include decomposition of large or
              complicated  models such as those occurring in resource allocation, 
              manufacturing, logistics and civil infrastructure design.  For  example, a
              water pressure control problem of finding values for  flow rates and pump
              pressure gaps to minimize pumping cost  subject to maintaining water pressures
              in allowable ranges at all  points in a pipe network can be solved via
              decomposition.  If the  flow rates are fixed then the subproblem of finding
              optimal  values for the pressure gaps is an easy-to-solve linear  minimization
              problem.  With this separation of variables approach  the outer problem of
              finding optimal values for the flow  variables is a nonsmooth problem whose
              solution can be found  efficiently via the techniques of this proposal.
