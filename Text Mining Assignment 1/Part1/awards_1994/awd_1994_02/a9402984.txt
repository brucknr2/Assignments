Abstract    :
              9402984  Hochstaedter    In this project the PIs will investigate the
              relationship  between rift-related and arc-related volcanism behind the 
              volcanic front of Izu arc using a combination of field  studies and
              geochemistry.  In these arcs rift and cross-  chain arc volcanism occur at
              similar distances from the slab  and overlap in eruption ages.  The PIs will
              also sample the  across arc seamounts in the Izu region.  They wish to  analyze
              the samples for trace elements and isotopes.  They  argue that by studying arc
              magmas further away from the  trench region they can get a much better handle
              on the  nature of the wedge mantle.  They will also be able to  determine
              whether the invasion of an enriched mantle  component is a prerequisite to
              rifting.    ***
