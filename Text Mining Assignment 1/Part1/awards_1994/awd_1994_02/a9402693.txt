Abstract    :
              9402693   EDWARDS      Direct dating of the marine S18 O record has been a
              classic problem  for the last four decades, and is still largely unsolved. 
              Interest  in this problem has increased in the wake of improvements in 
              analytical capabilities for measurement of 234 U/ 238 U (Chen et  al., 1986)
              and 230 Th/238 U (Edwards et al., 1987 a,b) and further  analytical refinements
              (Edwards et al., 1993).  However, attempts  to use 230 Th techniques to date
              deep-sea marine carbonates will be  faced with at least one major, perhaps
              insurmountable, obstacle:  separation of contaminant 230 Th produced by uranium
              in the  overlying water column from 230 Th produced by uranium in the 
              carbonate (Delaney and Boyle, 1983). Consequently, two alternate  approaches
              will be investigated to constrain the timing of the  marine S18 O record:  234
              U/238 U dating of carbonate-rich  sediments (Ku, 1965; Ludwig et al., 1991) and
              230 Th dating of  tropical-island speleothems. The 234U/238U ratio is measured
              with  a precision of +1 per mil (Edwards et al., 1993), which corresponds  to
              an error in 234U/238U age of +4Ka.  Thus high-resolution  234U/238U ages are in
              principle, possible. Bulk carbonate will be  analyzed from cores that have high
              primary uranium contents and are  close to 100% carbonate.  Also, dating of
              speleothems from tropical  islands will be dated with TIMS 230 Th techniques
              (Li et al., 1989;  Dorale et al., 1992; Baker et al., 1993; Richards et al., in
              press)  and may have S18 O values that mimic marine values, thereby  providing
              a means of dating the marine record.  These two  approaches will place direct
              constraints on the timing of the  marine S18 O record (over the past 350,000
              years) and will help to  understand the fundamental causes of Quaternary
              climate change.
