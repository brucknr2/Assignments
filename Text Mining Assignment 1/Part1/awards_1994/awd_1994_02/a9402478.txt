Abstract    :
                9402478  Adams  This project integrates three areas of research for Geographic
               Information Systems for engineering applications: a feature-based  rather than
              a layer-based approach to GIS, object-oriented rather  than relational database
              modeling, and the use of database  management technology as the framework for
              GIS.  New Technology and  models are being brought together.    This project
              fully implements and tests a feature model for GIS  within State-of-the-art
              object-oriented database management system  technology. The feature model can
              represent non-topological and  semantic relationships which are missing in
              traditional layer-based  GISs.  Because of the focus on the entity rather than
              the spatial  representation, the feature model promotes and enables complex 
              entities with non-spatial attributes and relationships.
