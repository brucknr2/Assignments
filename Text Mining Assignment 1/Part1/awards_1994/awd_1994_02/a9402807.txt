Abstract    :
              9402807  Cleaveland      The goals of this project involve the development of
              practical approaches to the automatic verification of finite-state concurrent
              systems, including hardware designs, communications protocols, and software
              requirements specifications.  Such systems are notoriously difficult to design,
              debug and maintain, owing to the subtle and often unanticipated interactions
              between components that parallelism induces.  One appealing approach to
              overcoming these problems involves the use of mathematical reasoning to ensure
              that systems behave as intended; this research aims at making the use of such
              formal analysis practical by developing suitable techniques, and associated
              software tools, that enable designers to analyze their systems as they are
              building them.  The proposed work would develop along the following lines: 
              Research would undertaken into more efficient algorithms for determining the
              correctness of concurrent systems;  techniques would investigated for enabling
              the analysis of larger systems than can currently be managed; he development of
              usable graphical and textual design languages would  undertaken, and
              appropriate tools implemented; methods would develop and implement for
              reasoning about real-time systems and about the relative reliability of
              systems.    ***
