Abstract    :
              9402989  MOUDGIL         The two-fold mission of the Engineering Research Center
              for  Particle Science and Technology is to:  (1) develop cost effective 
              processing and handling of particulate systems relevant to a wide  range of
              industries, such as chemicals and allied products,  textiles and paper
              products, coal, metals and minerals, energy and  environmental, construction,
              land and coastal management,  agricultural and food processing, cosmetics and
              pharmaceuticals,  advanced materials, etc., and (2) to educate students and
              other  professionals in the engineering practice of particle science and 
              technology.  A cross-disciplinary integrated research program will  focus on: 
              (1) dispersion, consolidation and redispersion, (2)  transport and handling,
              (3) particles in effluents, and (4)  analysis and characterization.  Research
              on simulation, modeling  and visualization will provide the integrating base
              for the  Center's research activities.  A testbed facility will be built for 
              validation, demonstration and development of process and product  ideas
              generated by the Center.  The educational program will  include development of
              curriculum in particle science and  technology, new courses and a minor in
              particle science and  technology.  Faculty and industrial experts will jointly
              develop  computer assisted learning modules, multimedia presentations and 
              textbooks.  A particle science and technology certificate program  for
              industrial personnel will be implemented.  The Center will  initiate a vigorous
              outreach program to disseminate information to  other academic and industrial
              institutions.       A consortium of 30 large and medium, and 18 small companies
               will actively participate in the Center's research and educational  programs,
              and four national laboratories will have joint research  projects with the
              Center.  Twenty-eight faculty members, 3  postdoctorals, 45 graduate and 25
              undergraduate students from 12  departments will participate during the first
              year.  The University  of South Flori da and Columbia University will
              participate in the  Center as subcontractors.       This award established the
              ERC under an initial 5-year  Cooperative Agreement.  ***
