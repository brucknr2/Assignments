Abstract    :
              Keigwin    The PI will conduct paleontological and isotopic studies of  changing
              hydrographic and climatic conditions since the last  glacial maximum (LGM) in
              the Okhotsk Sea and will attempt to link  these results to earlier
              reconstructions from the open Pacific.   Testing the hypothesis that
              nutrient-depleted watermass existed  during LGM in NW Pacific at <2300 m depths
              is also an objective.   Cores collected from the Okhotsk Sea in 1993 will be
              used for the  study.  Collaboration with a Russian scientist from the Pacific 
              Oceanological Institution at Vladivostok is planned.
