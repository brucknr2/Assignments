Abstract    :
              9402923  Reiter    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a collaboration between 
              Drs. George Reiter of the University of Houston, Houston, TX  and F.C. Barreto
              of the Universidade Federal de Minas  Gerais, Brazil.  The goal of the project
              is to form an  international collaboration between scientists experienced  in
              the treatment of low-dimensional magnetic systems, and to  resolve fundamental
              issues in the dynamics of spin and  charge that have arisen in the study of
              high temperature  superconductors.    No generally accepted theory exists of
              the mechanism for  superconductivity nor of the dynamics of the normal phase in
               the high Tc superconductors.  Two key issues are whether or  not the carriers
              in the materials can be described as a  strongly correlated Fermi liquid, and
              whether or not the  carriers would phase separate if not limited by the Coulomb
               interaction from doing so. There is no agreed upon answer to  the first
              question. While the answer to the second question  is yes, at some values of
              the parameters for the models that  have been used to describe the Cu-O planes
              the situation  remains unclear for the actual physical values.  A treatment  of
              the three band (Emery) model is proposed, which has the  potential of answering
               both of the above questions.      ***
