Abstract    :
              9402675  Sillen    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Sillen and his 
              colleagues will conduct biochemical work in the Pilanesberg Game  Reserve in
              South Africa. This technique development research will  provide information on
              a modern African food web and yield data  important for paleodietary research.
              The study will focus on  trace element variation at the base of food webs
              (plants) and  will also include interspecific and intraspecific variation in 
              primary and secondary consumers. The research design incorporates  controls for
              species, plant part, soil substrate, and season, and  sufficiently large
              numbers of specimens will be analyzed to  determine variability. Animal
              specimens will be examined to  ascertain trace elements for a number of
              species.     Paleodietary research plays an important role in archaeology 
              since scientists believe that the diet consumed during an  individual's
              lifetime leaves a chemical imprint on skeletal  tissues. Amounts of trace
              elements such as strontium are believed  to provide insight into the relative
              contribution of meat  consumed by an individual. However detailed studies which
               indicate how trace elements in fact move through the diet web are  lacking and
              without them it is impossible to move beyond  generalizations based on rough
              empirical data. This work is  important because it will help to refine
              techniques of major  anthropological importance.
