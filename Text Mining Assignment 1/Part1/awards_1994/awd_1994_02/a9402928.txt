Abstract    :
              9402928  Schmitt    This U.S.-Chile Cooperative Science award will support a 
              collaboration between Dr. Klaus Schmitt, University of Utah, and  Dr. Raul
              Manasevich, University of Chile, in a study on boundary  value problems for
              nonlinear partial differential equations.  The  purpose of the research is to
              study quasilinear problems, with  the goal of establishing global results about
              the solution  structures of such problems, with emphasis on the development of 
              a bifurcation theory.    Problems with nonlinear partial differential equations
              of  elliptic type which are parameter dependent and subject to  nonlinear
              constraints arise in a multitude of applied areas, such  as the study of porous
              media, plasma problems, and astrophysics.   The theory of quasilinear equations
              is just now being developed,  and an understanding of the bifurcation
              possibilities is an  important aspect that needs to be studied.  Both
              researchers are  considered experts in the field, and their collaboration could
               result in a major contribution to this area.              ***
