Abstract    :
              9402324  Chave       This experiment is designed to provide direct observational
               constraints on the distribution of melt and the pattern of  upwelling beneath
              a mid-ocean ridge.  Studies of electromagnetic  and seismic wave propagation in
              the mantle with arrays of ocean-  bottom instruments will furnish measurements
              that can be inverted  to find horizontal and vertical variations in velocity
              and  conductivity structure that can be used to test theoretical  models of
              flow.  56 seafloor electromagnetic instruments will be  deployed for one year
              at 17 degrees south on the East Pacific  Rise.  ***
