              Connection Project"  Austin Community College  PI:  Lee Hisle  NCR-9402177     
              This project connects Austin Community College to the Internet over a T1 
              (1.544 million bits per second) line.  Faculty and students at the schools 
              benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries  and
              supercomputers.  In addition, they are able to communicate and  collaborate
              with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research  and educational
              projects.  The award provides partial support of the  project for two years.
