Abstract    :
                  9402618  Ramesh  A fundamental investigation of the initiation and growth of
               adiabatic shear bands will be made in a combined theoretical-  experimental
              program.  Specifically the influence of microscopic  mechanisms, geometric
              defects and material properties on shear  localization will be examined.  The
              recovered specimens will be  examined using transmission electron microscopy in
              order to  characterize the microscopic mechanisms.  ***
