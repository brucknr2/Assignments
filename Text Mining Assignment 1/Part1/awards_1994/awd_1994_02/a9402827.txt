Abstract    :
                While much significant work has taken place in safe  monitoring  of
              non-real-time, conventional programs, very little has in fact  been done for
              real-time programs, and especially for real-time  programs that  implement
              complex safety-critical functions and  operate in distributed and  parallel
              environments. In this  project standard compiler static analyses and  prior
              analysis and  transformation results for reducing complexity in real-time 
              programs are combined to support safe and non-intrusive  monitoring of complex 
              real-time programs.  Existing transformations frequently  result in idling and 
              delaying non-functional code that is introduced to provide  time-  preserving
              balance across alternate branches of a conditional or  alternate combinations
              of resource requests.  These segments of  nonfunctional  code can be used to
              insert non-intrusive software  hooks to monitor real-time  execution.    The
              project seeks new ideas and prototyped  techniques in the areas of
              verification, simulation, monitoring  and debugging -  both static and dynamic.
              The primary focus  is techniques for safe and  non-intrusive monitoring of
              complex  real-time programs. Collaborative research  involving industrial 
              partners is pursued to validate and transfer these  results.
