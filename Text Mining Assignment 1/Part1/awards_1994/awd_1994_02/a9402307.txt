Abstract    :
              9402307  Gee    Sea surface magnetic anomaly profiles typically exhibit a short 
              wavelength acial high (called CAMH) over mid-oceanic ridges. In  this project
              the PIs will carry out a coring program to investigate  the origin of this
              high. They want to test the hypothesis whethr  low-temperature alteration of
              the crust is responsible for CAMH.  Because this high is sensitive to age, the
              PIs argue that a time  scale may also be developed   that will allow
              determination of ages  of <30 k.y. old MORB.
