Abstract    :
              9402818  Gao  The research proposed in this application is concerned with 
              developing a self-contained, micro ultrasonic transducer module  with on-board
              electronics which can be fully integrated into the  shaft of a conventional
              long cane to assist the visually impaired  in perceiving overhanging obstacles
              that are not detectable by  traditional canes.  Upon obstacle detection, a
              human voice  signal, describing in key words the distance and height of the 
              target, will be displayed to assist in orientation.    The first phase of the
              research focuses on the human factor study  to specify design rules that
              adequately serve the need of the  potential users.  The second phase will
              concentrate on the  design, modeling and prototyping of the transducer.  Focus
              will  be on the circuit miniaturization using established IC foundry 
              technologies, and the adaptation of the module to the cane.  The  final phase
              will be the performance evaluation and optimization  which will be conducted in
              close cooperation with the Louisiana  Center for the Blind in Ruston,
              Louisiana.  ***
