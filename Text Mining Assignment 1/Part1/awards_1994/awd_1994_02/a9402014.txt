Abstract    :
              9402014  Poe    This award supports a 12-month Science and Technology Agency of 
              Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Russell Poe, Department of  Chemistry,
              Virginia Commonwealth University, at the National  Institute of Hygienic
              Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Poe will work  with Dr. Yuzuru Hayashi in the
              Department of Medical Devices on a  research project entitled, "Chemometric
              Studies of Capillary Zone  Electrophoresis and Micellar Electrokinetic
              Capillary  Chromatography."    The research project focuses on improving the
              quantitative  abilities of high performance liquid chromatography and capillary
               electrophoresis.  The researchers will explore novel multivariate  calibration
              methods and digital filtering techniques and will  determine the accuracy and
              precision of these in quantifying  species from complex mixtures.  These
              techniques promise an  advantage of subtracting out unresolved components or
              variable  backgrounds and allowing multiple wavelengths to be detected at  the
              same time.  This will result in separations being performed  in less time and
              in peak purities being more accurately  determined.  ***
