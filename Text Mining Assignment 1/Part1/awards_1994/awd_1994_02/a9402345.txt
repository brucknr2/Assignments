Abstract    :
              9402345  Shimizu  This project will examine melt inclusions in a variety of
              olivines  to confirm a hypothesis, based on previous work, that melting 
              beneath mid-ocean ridges can occur much deeper than previously  believed.  The
              authors will also look for evidence of  disequilibrium for various elements,
              and will develop a detailed 3D  interpretation of melt history in a single
              system, based on a large  number of available samples.
