Abstract    :
              9402356  Chryssostomidis  This grant supports a joint United States-  United
              Kingdom workshop focusing on the  application of unmanned underwater vehicles 
              to the problems of pollution and global  climate monitoring.  Both countries
              have  ongoing research activities in all these  areas, and the United Kingdom
              has expressed  great interest in a joint workshop.  The two  fundamental
              motivations for international  cooperation are to prevent research 
              duplication, and to focus resources on  outstanding problems of mutual
              interest.  The  workshop will establish a direct dialog that  will determine
              the status of current research  and areas of mutual interest.  Identification 
              of areas fertile for US-UK collaboration will  be the highest priority of the
              workshop.  A  second objective is to develop an in depth  understanding of
              research in the UK in these  fields.
