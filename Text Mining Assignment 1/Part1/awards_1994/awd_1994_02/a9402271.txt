Abstract    :
              9402271  Hirsch    This Americas Program award will support Dr. Ann M. Hirsch, 
              University of California, Los Angeles, and Dr. Maria Valdez,  Instituto
              Politecnico Nacional, Mexico, in a research  collaboration on nitrogen-fixing
              symbiosis between Frankia  microbe strains and the Casuarina tree (Ironwood). 
              The  objective is to find efficient nitrogen-fixing strains that  can be used
              to inoculate Casuarina, an Australian tree  introduced in Mexico only 50 years
              ago. The researchers aim  to determine the means by which various isolates
              found in  nodules of the Casuarina tree fix nitrogen, and,  particularly, to
              examine whether the bacteria have  alternative nitrogenase genes.   
              Deforestation and the loss of arable lands in tropical and  subtropical
              countries are major global concerns.  Numerous  efforts to reclaim areas
              stripped of trees have failed  because the fragile tropical soils become
              depleted in both  nitrogen and phosphorous once the trees are removed.  The 
              introduction of nitrogen-fixing trees that also establish  mycorrhizal
              relationships is an approach to this problem.  This project will enable
              researchers to identify nitrogen-  fixing organisms that are well adapted for
              nitrogendepleted  tropical soils, and is of potential interest to other 
              tropical and subtropical countries having extensively  deforested regions with
              eroded soils.  ***
