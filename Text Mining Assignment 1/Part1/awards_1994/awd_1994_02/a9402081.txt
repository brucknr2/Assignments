Abstract    :
              NOWELL  9402081    The relationships between mineral charge and texture,
              sorption of  organic matter to mineral surfaces, and the preservation of
              organic  matter in marine sediments will be evaluated in the course of this 
              research.      Strong correlations between organic carbon preservation and
              mineral  fluxes & surface areas indicate that processes involving minerals 
              influence the amounts and types of organic matter preserved. Over  90% of the
              organic matter present in typical marine sediments is  sorbed to mineral
              surfaces and possibly impart stability to  inherently labile organic matter,
              dramatically slowing or stopping  the rate at which it is remineralized.   
              Mineral characteristics (mineralogy, cation exchange capacity,  surface area
              and microtopography) will be compared with organic  measurements and lability
              tests to estimate the extent that changes  in mineral type and texture affect
              the sorption and stability of  organic matter in marine sediments.  The
              analytical approach  proposed here should allow a first-order estimate of the
              importance  sediment mineralogy and texture have on organic matter 
              preservation.
