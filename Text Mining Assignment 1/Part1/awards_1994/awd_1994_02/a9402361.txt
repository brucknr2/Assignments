Abstract    :
              9402361  HEDGES         Over the next three years joint research will continue
              on the  sources and reactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in  seawater. 
              Studies will focus primarily on the 20-30% of total  dissolved organic matter
              which can be gently isolated in relatively  large amounts by tangential-flow
              ultrafiltration.  The three  central objectives of the research are: 1. To
              identify the  biological sources and transformations of the major DOM
              components.   2. To elucidate compositional trends among DOM constitutes of 
              different size. 3 To characterize in detail the compositions and  associations
              of the various organic materials comprising seawater  DOM.  Research to
              determine the biological and digenetic origins of  DOM will emphasize rapid
              processes occurring in the upper water  column where large differences in DOM
              concentrations and  compositions are observed.  A better understanding of
              compositional  trends among dissolved organic materials of different size will 
              help to delineate processes affecting DOM cycling and to judge how 
              representative ultrafiltered isolates are of bulk DOM.  More  detailed
              characterizations of the compositions and forms of ultra-  fitered DOM will aid
              in distinguishing its biological sources,  identifying key transformations, and
              deconvoluting functional re-  lationships among DOM constitutes.  This line of
              research has  already provided new insights on both the reactive and refractory
               components of the immense seawater DOM pool and should continue to  yield
              information useful over wide range of oceanographic studies.
