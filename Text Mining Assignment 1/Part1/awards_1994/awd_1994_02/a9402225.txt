Abstract    :
                Abstract      INT-9402225: U.S. National Committee on SCOPE    This award will
              provide core support to the National Academy of  Science (NAS) to manage U.S.
              scientific participation in the  Scientific Committee on Problems in the
              Environment (SCOPE), a  committee of the International Council of Scientific
              Unions (ICSU).   The objectives of SCOPE are: (1) to advance knowledge of (a)
              the  influence of humans on their environment and (b) the effects of 
              environmental changes upon people, their health, and their welfare, 
              particularly those influences and effects that are either global or are  shared
              by several nations; and (2) to serve as a council of scientists  acting as a
              source of advice to governments and intergovernmental  bodies on issues
              concerning the environment.  By means of this  award, U.S. scientists who
              comprise the U.S. National Committee  for SCOPE, and supporting staff at the
              NAS, will continue their  involvement in international projects coordinated by
              SCOPE on  sustainable development, biodiversity, and the effects of increased 
              ultraviolet radiation on biological systems.  ***
