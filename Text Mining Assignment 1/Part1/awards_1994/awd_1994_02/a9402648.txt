Abstract    :
              This project will lead to the development of a technique for measuring the
              composition of the  neutral atmosphere.  A high resolution spectrometer will be
              used to measure optical emissions  produced by atmospheric species.  By
              combining these measurements with theoretical models,  it is possible to
              determine neutral densities and temperatures and a scaling factor for the solar
               extreme ultraviolet flux.  The spectrometer will measure emissions between 560
              and 740  nanometers.  The instrument will provide the first measurements from
              the ground of several  important emissions produced in the mesosphere and
              thermosphere.
