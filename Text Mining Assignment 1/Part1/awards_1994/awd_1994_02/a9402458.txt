Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on a concept for reducing emissions of
              hydrocarbons from industrial thermal process exhaust gases and waste
              incinerators.  The emission control concept to be studied is based on using
              ionizing radiation produced by a beam of energized electrons accelerated by a
              solid-state, induction device.  The objective of this project is to determine
              the commercial feasibility of the process, the technical feasibility of which
              was established in Phase I of research conducted under NSF Grant No.  92-60496.
               This Phase II project involves conduct of laboratory experiments to determine
              the rate of hydrocarbon destruction by the electron beam, the dose and
              dose-rate needed, and effectiveness of the beam in a simulated stack
              environment.  Results of the experiments are planned to be used in design of
              interfaces between the induction accelerator and other system components.   The
              proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 92-30, Small
              Business Innovation Research (SBIR) under Topic 25d, Environmental Systems. 
              Results of this research are expected to determine the commercial feasibility
              of the proposed concept and the basis for its commercialization.  If
              successful, a process based on this concept has the potential of being widely
              used to control emissions of pollutants from incinerators and from industrial
              processes that result in production of gaseous hydrocarbons air pollutants.
