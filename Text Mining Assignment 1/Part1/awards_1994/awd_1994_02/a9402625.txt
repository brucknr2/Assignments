Abstract    :
              9402625  Miller       This award covers partial expenses for U.S. research 
              mathematicians to participate in a workshop whose primary focus  concerns
              symmetries and integrability of difference equations.   The motivation lies in
              efforts to develop tools for solving  nonlinear differential equations.  There
              are two main methods,  one involves Lie group theory, the other is
              integrability theory.  A notable development in the last twenty years
              exemplifying  integrability theory was the introduction of the inverse 
              scattering transform.  A much more recent development is that  similar
              techniques are being successfully applied to solve  equations that involve
              discrete variables: difference and  differential-difference equations.  Such
              equations are important  in physics in their own right, in the study of
              discrete systems  and theories on lattices, cellular automata, etc.  Moreover, 
              difference equations an variations thereof have gained great  prominence
              recently in the theory and applications of quantum  groups.       The workshop
              brings together contingents of leading  researchers from the United States and
              Canada together with a  sizable number of graduate students and postdoctoral
              faculty to  work together, with few formal lectures, for a period of seven 
              days on issues related to some of the truly exciting emerging  areas of
              mathematics and mathematical physics.  ***
