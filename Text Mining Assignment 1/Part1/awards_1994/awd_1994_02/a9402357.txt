Abstract    :
              9402357  Junku  The workshop's goal is to provide a forum for open  discussions
              on a number of issues with significant impact on  the future progress in the
              field of underwater robotic  systems.  The objectives of the workshop are: (1)
              To  summarize the current state-of-the-art in underwater  robotics; (2) To
              discuss application areas with potential  for immediate as well as long-term
              benefits and impact; (3)  To identify critical issues and challenging problems
              in  underwater robotics; (4) To initiate an effective mechanism  for
              communication and cooperation between different groups;  and (5) To provide
              recommendations on future research  directions in underwater robotics.    We
              would also like to discuss the role of federal and local  governments in
              addressing technical and scientific  competitiveness of the subject area.   
              The workshop will produce not only recommendations for  future research
              directions, but also exploration of  potential applications.  Research in
              underwater robotics can  be enhanced by establishing proper channels for 
              communication and technology transfer between different  groups and optimizing
              efficiency of available resources.
