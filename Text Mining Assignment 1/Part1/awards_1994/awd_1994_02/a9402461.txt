Abstract    :
              9402461  Thaddeus    Drs. Thaddeus and Gottlieb, at Harvard University, will
              continue a program of  laboratory millimeter-wave spectroscopy of reactive
              molecules of  astrophysical interest.  The emphasis of the investigation will
              be on detection  of key reactive species believed by astrochemists to be
              involved in molecular  formation in space.  Two complementary methods of
              reactive molecule  production -- gas discharge and H abstraction -- will be
              used.  Several small  three-membered carbene rings are excellent candidates for
              detection, and  specific five-membered carbene rings will be sought.
