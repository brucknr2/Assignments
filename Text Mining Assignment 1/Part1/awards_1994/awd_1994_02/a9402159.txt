Abstract    :
              94-02159  Farley         In this project the PIs will participate in the EDISON
              cruise  (Germany, Canada, US, and Australian participants; Crusie ship-  Sonne
              (German) to investigate structure, petrology, tectonics of  the young alkaline
              volcanic centers (TLTF) in the southwestern  Pacific.  An intriguing aspect of
              this study is the presence of  mantle wedge xenoliths in some of the alkaline
              basalts.  These  xenoliths are sulfate and carbonate-rich (metasomatized). 
              Another  intriguing aspect is the 1982 discovery of a gold deposit in Lihir 
              island.  The authors argue that "this is probably the best known  locality in
              the world" in which to investigate the interrelation-  ship between extensional
              tectonics in a convergent margin, arc  magmatism, mantle metasomatism, and
              gold-copper mineralization.   This is what the team will do.  Ship time and
              other expenses at sea  will be borne by the Germans; the PIs are only
              requesting funds for  pre-cruise expenses and post-cruise research.
