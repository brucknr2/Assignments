Abstract    :
              9402938  Shih    The Principal Investigator will investigate the structural, 
              electronic and optoelectronic properties of semiconductor  heterostructures and
              the correlation between them by using three  forms of scanning probe microscopy
              (STM):  scanning tunneling  microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S), tip-induced
              luminescence, and  localized photoluminescence based on scanning near field
              optical  microscopy (SNOM).  The unprecedented spatial resolution of these 
              techniques make them the ideal tools for microscopic investigations  of these
              properties at the heterostructure interfaces.  The work  will focus on:  (1)
              band discontinuities; (2) metallurgical  controllability; and (3) effects of
              structural defects on the  electronic and optoelectronic properties.    % % % %
                 This project will develop novel experimental methods to study the  physical
              properties at the interface between two different  semiconductors.  The study
              will allow direct visualization of the  arrangement of different atoms at such
              interfaces.  More  importantly the study will allow one to understand how these
              atomic  arrangements influence the behavior of electrons and the light 
              emitting properties in electronic devices.  The results will have  immediate
              technological impact on the development of future  electronic devices to be
              used in the next generation computers and  optical communications.  ***
