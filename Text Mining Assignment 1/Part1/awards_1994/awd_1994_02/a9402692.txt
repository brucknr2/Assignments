Abstract    :
                    9402692  Schadler  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is made to
              evaluate Laser  Raman Spectroscopy Techniques for use as an experimental tool
              to  measure the local three dimensional state of stress in composites.   Since
              failure is a localized event it is important to have good  local data and in
              the case of composites the deviation from  uniformity is much greater than in
              many conventional materials.  If  successful, this would be a new technique for
              obtaining these local  stresses and therefore useful in evaluating the safety
              of  structures made of composites.  ***
