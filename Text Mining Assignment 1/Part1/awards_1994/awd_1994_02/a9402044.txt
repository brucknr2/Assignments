Abstract    :
              9316137  Bjarnason    This research is to demonstrate that melt flow patterns
              can be  determined seismically by imaging the upper mantle beneath the mid- 
              Atlantic in northern Iceland by deploying an array of 30 PASSCAL  seismic
              instruments for 9 months.  Oceanic crustal material is  created by the
              pressure-release melting of upwelling mantle beneath  mid-ocean ridges;
              however, the details of the mantle flow pattern  and the processes by which
              melt segregates and ascends to crustal  levels are poorly understood.  From
              surface wave phase velocities  and body wave travel time delays, the
              researchers will construct  images of compressional and shear velocity in the
              upper mantle down  to about 150 km.  The objectives are: 1) to determine if
              mantle  upwelling beneath the ridge is narrowly or broadly focused and to 
              explore the effects of the Iceland hotspot, 2) to determine if  retained
              partial melt exists within the shallow mantle beneath the  ridge, 3) to define
              the depth range of any zone of retained partial  melt, and 4) to distinguish
              among theoretical mantle flow and melt  transport models on the basis of the
              width of the zones of  upwelling and melt generation.    ***
