Abstract    :
              9402008  Davis  This grant will support a unique combination of laboratory and 
              numerical modeling of the tectonic behavior of thick sediment  sequences in
              accretionary prisms.  Three directions of research  will be pursued: 
              mechanical behavior and stability of deforming  wedges and the conditions under
              which both thrust and normal  faults can co-occur; interactions of mechanical
              deformation and  fluid flow and how shallow structures are controlled by 
              conditions at depth; deformation of highly porous sediments at  the toe of the
              wedge.  ***
