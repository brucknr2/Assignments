Abstract    :
              9402805  Becker  This project is to purchase and modify a high-temperature (>350
              degrees C),   programmable temperature-logging tool for use in measuring
              subsurface temperatures in   holes drilled by the Ocean Drilling Program vessel
              R/V JOIDES Resolution.  The tool will   have internal recording capability for
              both subsurface pressure (depth) and temperature,   and may be deployed without
              special logging cable, allowing its use rapidly and without   specialized
              shipboard instrumentation or deployment capabilities.  The tool will be  
              modified to allow its use from the submersible DSV Alvin, and it will be used
              for   measuring downhole temperatures at "TAG" drill holes in the hydrothermal
              vent area on   the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during ODP Leg 158, scheduled for
              September-November 1994.    PI Becker will participate in Leg 158 drilling as a
              member of the downhole logging team.    The tool will also be used during
              subsequent submersible diving with DSV Alvin, to   reoccupy these "CORKed"
              holes in the seafloor at TAG to observe changes in   temperature structure at
              these sites during 1995. Two Alvin dives are awarded to the PI   for this
              purpose in the award.  The logging tool will be available to other researchers
              for   use on JOIDES Resolution, DSV Alvin, or other appropriate platforms in
              the future.  ***
