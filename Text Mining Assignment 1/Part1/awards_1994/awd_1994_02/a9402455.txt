Abstract    :
              9402455  Primack       Theoretical research in cosmology and particle physics
              will  focus on the nature and distribution of the dark matter (DM) in  the
              universe.  A major part of the research will involve  construction and analysis
              of models, currently concentrating on  Cold + Hot Dark Matter (CHDM), and
              detailed comparison with  observational data.  A closely related major subject
              of the  research will be the spatial distribution of dark matter in the 
              universe as revealed both via large-scale velocity flows and the  velocity
              curves of spiral galaxies.  There will also be study of  the origin of the
              density fluctuations during inflation and the  implications for large scale
              clustering and the cosmic microwave  background.  The research to be undertaken
              deals with centrally  important questions about what the universe is, and how
              it came  to be.  ***
