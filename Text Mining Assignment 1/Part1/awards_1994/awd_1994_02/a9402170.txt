Abstract    :
              9402170  Dolan, Charles W.    This project is a three year study to evaluate the
              sustained load  capacity of available fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) tendons
              for  application as reinforcement is reinforced and prestressed  concrete
              structures.  The proposal addresses the following major  areas:    -    The
              creep-rupture characteristics of FRP reinforcement.    -    The long term
              characteristics of FRP reinforcement.    -    Compare the creep-rupture
              behavior of FRP reinforcement in       air and in concrete structure.    -   
              The strain reserve of FRP reinforcement at the end of 30       months of
              extended environmental exposure in a concrete -  structure.  ***
