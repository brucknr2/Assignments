Abstract    :
              9402110  Schlosser    This award provides funding to construct an inlet system
              for mass  spectrometric measurement of tritium by the He ingrowth method. The 
              inlet system will automate the processing of tritium samples 1)  increasing the
              capacity of the laboratory, and 2) improving the  quality of the tritium
              measurements. The increased capacity of the  laboratory will be necessary to
              process the large number of samples  generated by a variety of NSF-funded
              research projects,  particularly WOCE studies of deep water formation in the
              Arctic and  Antarctic oceans and long-term observations of deep water formation
               in the Greenland/Norwegian and Labrador seas.     The PI has established a
              state-of-the-art laboratory for noble gas  measurement over the past six years.
              The laboratory currently  consists of two mass spectrometers; one dedicated to
              heavy noble   gas measurements (from 3He to 136 Xe) and the other dedicated to
              He  isotope and tritium measurements. The demand for He isotope and  tritium
              measurements has grown to the point that separated mass  spectrometers are
              needed for He and tritium. This demand has been  created by oceanographic
              studies funded by NSF/OCE, NSF/OPP and  NOAA. NOAA has provided $200,000 for
              acquisition of third mass  spectrometer that will by dedicated to tritium
              measurements. This  proposal  will allow the PI to construct an inlet system
              for the  new tritium mass spectrometer consisting of (1) a cryogenic cold  trap
              system for separation of helium from other gases, (2) gas  pipettes for
              standardization, and (3) the sample inlet and  purification lines. The expected
              capacity of the new system will be  1500 samples per year which should by
              sufficient to meet the  demands of currently funded research projects. Future
              expansion of  the inlet system will be possible should demand exceed 1500
              samples  per year.    Joint funding for this award will be provided by the OCE
              Arctic  Systems Science Program, the OCE/Physical Oceanography Program, the 
              OCE/Instrumentation and Techn ical Services Program, and the Polar  Ocean and
              Meteorology Program.
