Abstract    :
                9402255  Douglas    This U. S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award
              supports  travel expenses related to the visits of Drs. Jim Douglas  and Felipe
              Pereira, Purdue  University, Indiana, to Brazil.  The purpose of the visits is
              to perform modeling, analysis  and design of numerical methods for the
              simulation of  multiphase flows in multi-length scale, heterogeneous porous 
              media.   The Brazilian researchers involved in this project  are Prof. Paulo
              Jorge S. Paes Leme  of the Instituto  Politecnico of the Universidade do Estado
              do Rio de Janeiro  and Dr. Mauricio Kischinhevsky, of the Universidade Federal 
              Fluminense.    The project aims at two problems: understanding the 
              hydrodynamics involving secondary oil recovery in petroleum  reservoirs,
              particularly in naturally fractured reservoirs.  Secondly, the project will
              simulate contamination  of ground  water  in formations that present
              multi-length scale  heterogeneities, and/or  that can  possibly be  fractured. 
              The computations  involve the use of massively parallel  processing.  Both the
              U.S. and Brazil confront  critical  energy problems, and are interested in
              reducing  contamination of ground water.  Therefore both countries are 
              expected to benefit from this  collaboration.      ***
