Abstract    :
              9402348  Purdy    The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake an
              ocean  sciences instrumentation development project to design improvements  and
              rebuild a unique deep-towed sound source called NOBEL (Near  Ocean Bottom
              Explosives Launcher).  NOBEL allows geophysicists to  undertake high resolution
              seismic experiments at depths of up to  6,000 meters by placing the sound
              source and receivers directly on  the sea floor rather than having the source
              in the water column  some distance above the seafloor.  This improved
              capability  provides more detailed determinations to be made of the seismic 
              velocity structure of igneous and sedimentary features than is  possible using
              conventional seismic equipment.  NOBEL has been used  previously with mixed
              success, but seismic data that were obtained  were of high quality.  Design
              improvements to me made will improve  NOBEL's performance and reliability for a
              variety of future  research projects.  The Office of Naval Research is
              cost-sharing  this project.
