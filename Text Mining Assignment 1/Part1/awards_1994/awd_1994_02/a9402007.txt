Abstract    :
              9402007  Zingaro  This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Ralph  Zingaro
              in a research collaboration with Professor  Padmanabhan Nair of the Laboratorio
              de Energia Solar in  Cuernavaca, Mexico.  The researchers intend to study  the
              preparation of semiconducting thin films of metal  sulfides, selenides and
              tellurides by chemical  deposition from homogeneous solutions.  These films are
               of potential application to infrared detection, solar  control filters,
              low-cost solar technology, metal  chalcogenide thin films photography and photo
              voltaic  and electronic device applications.    The proposed work will combine
              the chemical expertise  and instrumental capabilities of the Texas A&M group 
              with the expertise in solid state physics and specific  instrumentation of the
              group in Mexico.  The deposition  method chosen by the investigators has the
              advantage  that it is low in cost, has minimum energy  requirements, does not
              require high capital investment  and can be utilized in locations that do not
              possess  technical sophistication.  ***
