Abstract    :
              9402145  Ogilby  University of New Mexico    The events that result in the
              photo- and electric current-induced degradation of polymer-based
              electroluminescent light emitting diodes (LED's) will be studied and then
              controlled. Spectroscopic and chemical analysis will be performed to determine
              if oxygen is involved in the degradation. In a second project, oxygen-induced
              deactivation of excited states of organic molecules and the concomitant
              production of singlet oxygen will be studied. Factors that influence the
              fraction of b1Sg+ excited state oxygen in solution and the a1Dg excited state
              in solid polymers will be examined. In a third study, the removal of O2 (b1Sg+)
              by reaction with an organic substrate will be examined in solution.     This
              grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor Peter R.
              Ogilby at the University of New Mexico. Excited states of light emitting diodes
              (LED's) will be produced by application of an electric current in the presence
              of oxygen. Energy will be transferred from the excited state LED to oxygen with
              the concomitant production of two different excited state oxygen species. The
              unique reactions of these two excited state oxygen species will be studied and
              the results will form the basis of a method to protect LED's from degradation.
              These reactions will also be studied in solution with other organic molecules.
              The production of these two excited states of oxygen by energy transfer from
              other organic molecules and subsequent reactions in solution will be studied.
