Abstract    :
              9402030  Miller  This project is on research to examine the effects of low
              oxygen  levels and high carbon dioxide levels on Chinese Hamster Ovary  (CHO)
              cell growth and metabolism, tissue plasminogen activator  (tPA) synthesis,
              glycosylation, and proteolysis.  This project  will also attempt to
              characterize the mechanisms responsible for  changes in tPA quality, and
              address problems that are encountered  in the large scale production of
              therapeutic proteins by  mammalian cell culture.  ***
