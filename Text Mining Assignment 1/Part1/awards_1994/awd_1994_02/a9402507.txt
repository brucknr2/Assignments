Abstract    :
              9402507  Berndt    In this project the P.I.s will conduct an experimental study
              to  investigate methane production and serpentinization over a wide P,T  and
              fluid composition range.  Their results will have a bearing on  methane
              production and serpentinization in subseafloor hydrothermal  systems and
              C-cycle in oceanic environment.
