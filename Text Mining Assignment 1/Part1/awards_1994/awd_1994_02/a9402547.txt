Abstract    :
              9402547  Suckewer  The goal of this project is to develop a VUV laser with an
              output  lasing wavelength near 60 nm.  Because its photon energy (~20eV) 
              matches molecular bonding energies and is typical of the energy  values used in
              photoelectron spectroscopy, there will be several  very important applications
              for a source of this type in chemical  research.  Ultimately we envision the
              development of a practical  laboratory-size instrument with output power at a
              wavelength of  ~60 nm which exceeds any present source,including synchrotrons. 
              Our prototypes will be used in experiments conducted in  collaboration with
              Prof. G. Scoles and his group in the Chemistry  Department for (a) high
              resolution photoelectron spectroscopy at  high dilution and (b) mass
              spectroscopy and time-of-flight  molecular beam experiments.  This laser may
              also become an  important device for material science research particularly in 
              the study of photoelectron effects in semiconductors and for  solid state
              physics in general.  As has been the case with other  laser developments,
              success may lead to many unexpected  applications perhaps opening up new areas
              of physics and  chemistry.  Our proposal for the development of VUV laser in
              MoVII uses the  photopumping scheme of Feldman and Reader. The scheme is based
              on  their observation of a unique line coincidence for two different  ions of
              the same element, namely the MoII line at 13.65 nm which  coincides with a
              MoVII line.  Both line are strongly coupled to  the ground state.  This makes
              them a suitable pair to be  exploited for the photopumping scheme i.e. for the
              creation of a  population inversion and gain on the 4p56s-4p55p transitions in 
              MoVII at a wavelength near 60nm.  ***
