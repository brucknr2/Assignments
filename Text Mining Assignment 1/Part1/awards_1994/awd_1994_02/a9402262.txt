Abstract    :
              ***  9402262  WALTER  SBIR phase-II funds are provided to investigators at
              IntraSpec Inc. to develop a technology for the fabrication of less expensive
              silicon radiation sensors.  Silicon x-ray energy spectrometers have become a
              very important tool for elemental analysis in research and industry. 
              Currently, the deep sensitive depths required for silicon x-ray detectors and
              some other silicon detector applications usually are obtained by a compensation
              technique commonly referred to as Li Drifting.  Unfortunately, Li Drifting is
              only quasi-stable at room temperature and very unstable at higher temperatures.
               The temperature stability problem limits the performance and general
              usefulness of these detectors by prohibiting modern device processing
              technologies like oxide surface passivation and high-temperature contact
              formation.  This research addresses the feasibility study of an alternative
              approach to compensation of silicon which would allow sensitive depths > 3 mm,
              be compatible with high-temperature oxide passivations, allow high-temperatures
              contact formation , and be cheaper than Li Drifting.  this new technology
              should result in cheaper x-ray detectors which will operate satisfactorily at
              the higher temperatures obtainable with thermoelectric or other alternative
              cooling techniques.  It also should make it possible to build very large area,
              deep sensitive depth detectors at reasonable prices.  A high-temperature
              compatible technology which can replace Li compensation will have  a large
              impact on the silicon x-ray energy spectroscopy market; particularly in the
              area of portable field instruments.  It also will unlock new market
              opportunities in silicon charged particle detector spectroscopy and perhaps in
              optical detectors.  ***
