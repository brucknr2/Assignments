Abstract    :
              9402091  McIntosh       This study will investigate the effect of the surface 
              morphology of a subducting oceanic plate upon the structure  and seismicity of
              the over-riding continental plate.  It  will use land- and sea-based seismics
              to examine transects  over three regions of the Cocos plate chosen for their 
              different morphology: one smooth, one with numerous  seamounts, and one bearing
              the Cocos Ridge.  A primary goal  is to test a recent theory that seamounts
              serve as sites for  concentration of earthquakes ("asperities").  A grid of 
              OBS's in the seamount-dominated region will be used to  examine this topic.
