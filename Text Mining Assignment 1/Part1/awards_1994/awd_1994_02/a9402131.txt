Abstract    :
              9402131  Stroud  Theoretical and computational studies will be done in two areas
              of  materials research.  The first area involves studies of two types  of
              weakly coupled superconducting systems: (i) Josephson arrays and  (ii) layered
              superconductors.  The bulk of the Josephson array work  will involve their
              dynamic properties by solving the coupled  Josephson equations for overdamped
              and underdamped arrays.  In  layered superconductors studies will be made of
              flux lattice  melting in highly anisotropic superconductors.  The second area
              of  research will be "classical" nonlinear properties of granular  materials,
              in particular, nonlinear optical properties.  %%%  Research will be done on the
              properties of granular materials. In  particular, work will be done on granular
              superconductors and on  granular optical materials.  Both classes of materials
              have unusual  properties which need to be understood on a fundamental level and
               which could have important technological applications.  ***
