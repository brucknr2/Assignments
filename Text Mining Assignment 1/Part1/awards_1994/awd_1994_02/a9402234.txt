Abstract    :
              9402234  Raufaste  This award is for continued support for the U.S.-Japan Panel
              on  Wind and Seismic Effects which was established in 1968.  The  Panel
              develops technologies that advance engineering design and  construction
              practices for improved quality-of-life.  The Panel  is composed of 18 federal
              agencies who participate in ten task  committees.  The task committees focus on
              specific national  issues, e.g., earthquake hazards reduction; passive and
              active  control systems; repair and rehabilitation of structures; and  wind and
              earthquake engineering for offshore structures.  Annual  meetings alternate
              between Japan and the U.S.  ***
