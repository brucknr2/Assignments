Abstract    :
              Deep-sea cores provide the basic raw material for studies in  paleoceanography,
              paleoclimatology, sediment dynamics, and chemical  oceanography.  The curation
              facilities provide an invaluable  service to the marine geology and geophysics
              and chemical  oceanographic communities.  Funds are provided for the continued 
              support for three years of the core repository at LDEO.  These  funds will
              defray the costs of core handling, description,  curation, sample distribution
              and data management.
