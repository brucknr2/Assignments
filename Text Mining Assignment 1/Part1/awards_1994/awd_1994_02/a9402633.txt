Abstract    :
              An improved understanding of upper ocean circulation and thermocline ventilation
              in the South Atlantic Ocean will be achieved through the use of passive
              chemical tracers. The analysis will be based on the use of the high quality
              three-dimensional tracer and hydrographic dataset collected in the Atlantic
              ocean during the 1980's and simple numerical models to estimate the rate and
              pathways of ventilation of thermocline waters.
