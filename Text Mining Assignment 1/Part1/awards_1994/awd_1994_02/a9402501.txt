Abstract    :
              9402501  De Lumen    This award supports the travel expenses for Dr.  Benito De
              Lumen of the Department of  Nutritional Sciences at the University of 
              California at Berkeley to spend eleven months  in Japan conducting
              collaborative research with  Dr. Fumio Takaiwa, Department of Cell Biology  at
              the National Institute of Agrobiological  Resources in Tsukuba. The research
              will focus  on the regulation of gene expression at the  transcription level
              that results in tissue and  stage-specific expression in rice seed  endosperm. 
                Dr. Takaiwa and his team have made significant  progress in cloning and
              characterizing a number  of rice glutelin genes. Working with Dr.  Takaiwa, Dr.
              De Lumen will attempt to  clone and sequence a cDNA encoding a nuclear  protein
              that binds to the 5' upstream region of  a rice glutelin gene, then to
              establish the  stage-specific expression of this cDNA, and  finally to compare
              its homology with cloned  transcription factors.  This project depends  heavily
              on the groundwork established by Dr.  Takaiwa in identifying upstream DNA
              control  sequences in a rice glutelin gene that interact  with nuclear
              proteins. This work should  facilitate the cloning of similar transcription 
              factors using methionine-rich protein genes  from soybeans when Dr. De Lumen
              returns to his  laboratory in Berkeley.    This award is funded under the
              auspices of the  Center for Global Partnership (CGP) of the  Japan Foundation
              under the NSF-CGP Science  Fellowship Program.  ***
