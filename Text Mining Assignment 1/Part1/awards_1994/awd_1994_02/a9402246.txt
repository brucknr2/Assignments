Abstract    :
                                   9402246  Duda      This is the first year award of a
              three-year project to  investigate the creation and evaluation of a process
              model of how  humans locate sounds in three dimensions.  Emphasis is placed in 
              understanding well- established but yet incompletely understood 
              psycho-acoustical phenomena.  An example of such phenomena is the  human
              perception capability of determining whether sounds come from  above or below
              without binaural differentiation of the sounds  reaching the ears; another
              example is the ability to locate sounds  in reverberant environments with
              multiple sound sources where  echoes and reflections become virtual sound
              sources.  Another one  yet is the ability to judge distance to a sound source
              since  loudness alone is not an adequate cue.   This model is based not  only
              on physical sound propagation effects but also on  neurophysiological studies
              tracing the auditory pathways from the  cochlea to the auditory cortex. The
              model extends current  computational cochlea models by incorporating mono- and
              binaural,  temporally-based, correlation methods for source-locality 
              information extraction.  The ability to understand these mechanisms  allows the
              recognition of sounds and speech by computers in  everyday environments,
              thereby improving the effectiveness of  speech recognition in human-computer
              interaction.
