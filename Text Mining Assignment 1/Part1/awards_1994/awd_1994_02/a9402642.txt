Abstract    :
              9402642  Worthen      This award is under the International Junior Investigator 
              and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers
              to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research centers of
              proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint 
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a six-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Wade B. Worthen of Furman University to
              work  with Dr. Klaus Rohde at the University of New England in New  South
              Wales, Australia.    Their research will directly test the effects of
              temperature  on the speed of selection and rate of mutation using  Drosophila
              melanogaster flies as a model system.  There are  two aspects  to their plan,
              the first is selection and  mutation experiments in the lab and second, a field
              and  literature survey of latitudinal changes in drosophilid  diversity and
              generation time.  The focus of the research  will be several lab experiments
              selecting for various traits  in Drosophila melanogaster under different 
              temperature  treatments.  These experiments will determine whether  populations
              at higher temperatures have higher mutation  rates, shorter generation times,
              and more rapid responses to  selection than populations at lower temperatures. 
              This  research is likely to make an important contribution to the  study of
              biodiversity and will expand what we know about a  critical determinant of a
              primary global pattern ***
