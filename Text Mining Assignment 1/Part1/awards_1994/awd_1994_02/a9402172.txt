Abstract    :
              9402172  Mutter       This is an eight-day multichannel seismic investigation of
               the robust, intermediate-to-fast-spreading ridge north of the  Orozco fracture
              zone.  The aim is to characterize the nature of  the axial magma chamber
              reflections and determine variability in  depth, strike, width, and thickness
              of reflecting bodies as well  as to determine relationship between these
              variables and ridge  morphology.  The "normal-looking' ridge just north of the
              Orozco  will also be characterized.  This seismic investigation of an 
              inflated- and normal-looking ridge crest will address whether  bathymetric
              expressions can be used to infer magmatic budget.  Can the state of magmatic
              activity in the crust and on the  seafloor?  ***
