Abstract    :
              9402837  Katz  This award supports a special year in algebraic geometry at 
              Oklahoma State, focusing on mirror symmetry, Donaldson theory for  algebraic
              surfaces, and related areas.  These are areas of  algebraic geometry for which
              connections with different areas of  mathematics and physics are apparent and
              emerging.  There will be  2-4 visitors in residence for the academic year in
              addition to  the three permanent algebraic geometers on the faculty.  In 
              addition, there will be atleast 55 short term visitors; many of  these will be
              participants in two 3 day workshops.  The research is in the field of algebraic
              geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
              blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems 
              that have stood for centuries.  Orginally, it treated figures  defined in the
              plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials.  Today, the field uses
              methods not only from  algebra, but also from analysis and topology.  Moreover,
              it has  proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical 
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
