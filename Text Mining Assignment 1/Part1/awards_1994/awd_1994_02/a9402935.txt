Abstract    :
              9402935  Meyer  This award, made in the Advanced Materials and Processing 
              Program deals with the design, synthesis and characterization  of molecular
              photonic materials. These materials will be  derived from monolithic gels in
              which steady-state and time  dependent optical properties can be systematically
              varied. A  key goal will be to efficiently produce long-lived photoinduced 
              charge separation within the solid state.  Light absorbing  species will be
              metal to ligand charge transfer complexes of  ruthenium and osmium imbedded
              into sol-gel matrices. Energy and  electron acceptors will be substituted
              anthracenes and methyl  viologens, tethered to gel matrices. By layering gels
              of donors  and acceptors it will be possible to segregate the steps of  light
              absorption, energy transfer, and electron transfer,  mimicking the primary
              events in photosynthesis.    This research will bridge the gap between known
              solution  chemistry and emerging technology of solid state materials  based on
              sol-gel processing. The technology will find  application in practical
              molecular level devices such as  chemical sensors, photovoltaic cells, and
              linear and nonlinear  optical devices.
