Abstract    :
              9402247  Navarro  Delaware County Community College requests support from NSF
              for  connection of its campus network to JVNCnet.  JVNCnet is the  midlevel
              network located in the state of New Jersey and it will  provide operations
              management and information services and it  will give Delaware County Community
              College a connection to the  NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
              second) National  Backbone network.    The college needs greater functionality
              and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make
              file transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
               Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a
              unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
