Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9402682  I. Manas-Zloczower    An experimental and theoretical
              study on the structure, breakage and dispersion of clusters of particulate
              materials by hydrodynamics stresses will be undertaken.  Three materials with
              similar macroscopic behavior in dispersion, carbon black, titanium dioxide, and
              silica clusters, will be considered for experiments.  The physical and chemical
              characteristics of solids and carrier fluid, interfacial properties of
              individual units comprising the clusters, and overall properties of the
              clusters assemblies and their cohesivity will be investigated, including the
              effect on the fluid infiltration into the agglomerates, inter-aggregate bonds
              and breakage, cohesivity, dispersion processes, fluid flow rates of
              deformation.    The dispersion of small particle aggregates is important in
              many industrial processes in chemical, minerals and food industries.  If
              successful, the project will improve understanding for the design of mixing
              liquid-solids systems.
