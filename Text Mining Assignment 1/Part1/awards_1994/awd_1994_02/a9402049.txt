Abstract    :
              9402049  Chou  The neural network's capability of making reasonable response 
              (output) even  when it was presented with incomplete, noisy or  previously
              unseen input has significant impact in engineering  applications. Many times,
              due to physical or environmental  limitations such as after a natural disaster,
              not all forms or  types of data are collected for safety analysis. In this 
              situation, tradition reliability analysis could be halted,  terminated or
              greatly compromised. In addition, neural network  accepts relationships between
              input and response that are  deterministic, probabilistic or fuzzy. The Career
              Advancement  Award for Women Scientists and Engineers provides the 
              Investigator an opportunity to expand her current research area  of structural
              safety utilizing probabilistic, statistical and  fuzzy set theory to civil
              engineering, particularly structural  engineering. Neural network is an
              artificial intelligence tool  that has shown to be more flexible than expert
              systems. From  studies performed in other engineering disciplines, they show 
              great potential that the concept is applicable to civil  engineering problems
              as well.  ***
