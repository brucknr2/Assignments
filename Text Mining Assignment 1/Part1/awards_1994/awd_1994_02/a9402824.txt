Abstract    :
              9402824  Skalak  This proposal from University of California at San Diego 
              requests partial support to conduct a conference entitled  Biomaterials:
              Cellular Response to Implanted Materials.    The symposium focuses on
              integration of the structure and  surface properties of implants form the
              standpoint of the  cellular level responses of biological tissues to non- 
              biological materials and to survey current clinical  rehabilitation needs in
              regards to the performance of  implanted biomaterials.  The aim of the
              conference is to  bring together materials scientists, cell biologists  and 
              practicing clinicians in rehabilitation medicine.  %%%  Presenter participants
              in the symposium are world leaders in  biomaterials, cell biology, and clinical
              rehabilitation  medicine.  Funding requested from the NSF would provide 
              partial support for invited participants.  The results of  the conference will
              be recorded in a Proceedings, which will  be sent to all conference
              participants and to related  organizations and agencies, thereby making
              symposium results  available to a large audience.  ***
