Abstract    :
              9402853  Ducharme  This is an initiative to establish collaborative research
              between  the Principle Investigator's laboratory and the Electronic  Materials
              Laboratory, headed by distinguished scientist Dr.  Vladimir Fridkin, in the
              Institute of Crystallography of the  Russian Academy of Sciences.    The
              interests and capabilities of the two laboratories are  complementary. 
              Fridkin's laboratory has extensive background and  current activity in
              photoferroelectric and photovoltaic phenomena  in crystals and polymers. 
              Ducharme's laboratory is studying  photorefractive and related properties of
              polymers, as well as  other novel photonic materials and devices.    We propose
              to bring one of Fridkin's associates, Dr. Valeri  Lazarev, to work in
              Ducharme's laboratory for two years.  Lazarev  will conduct experimental
              studies of photorefractive and  photovoltaic phenomena in polymers and
              transient grating studies of  the pyroelectric gratings in electro-optic
              materials.  He will also  contribute to other ongoing research in Ducharme's
              laboratory.    Fridkin and his colleagues in Moscow will provide samples of 
              photonic materials, including ferroelectric polymers and electro-  optic and
              photorefractive crystals.  Fridkin will develop  theoretical models of the
              results and also provide guidance to the  direction of the ongoing research in
              Ducharme's laboratory.  ***
