Abstract    :
              9402278  Bajaj  In this research project the response of nonlinear systems  to
              nonstationary excitations is investigated leading to  analytic relationships
              between nonlinear system parameters  and nonstationary response
              characteristics, such as maximum  response amplitude and timing of sudden jumps
              in amplitude.  These relationships are helpful in the design of vibration 
              isolation strategies for the dynamic characteristics of  highly nonlinear
              systems, for example, response of rotating  machinery during startup and
              acceleration through critical  speeds. The research methodology uses a
              combination of the  traditional asymptotic nonlinear vibration theory and the 
              recently developed dynamic bifurcation theory. Amplitude  characteristics of
              the nonlinear response of single and  multi-degree-of-freedom systems are
              investigated  analytically, and the results are validated experimentally  using
              lightly damped beams subjected to harmonic  excitations.  ***
