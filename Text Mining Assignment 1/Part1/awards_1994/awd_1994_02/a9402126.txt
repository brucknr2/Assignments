Abstract    :
              Taylor  9402126       This award provides partial support for the Eighteenth 
              Summer Symposium in Real Analysis.  These regular meetings have  attracted an
              international roster of participants making vital  research contributions in
              this core area of the mathematical  sciences.  The schedule is arranged to
              provide maximum  opportunities for genuine interaction on current research 
              activity.  Five plenary lectures on recent discoveries on  fractals, Hausdorff
              and packing measure for self-affine carpets,  measure properties of tree-like
              constructions, multifractals and  geometric properties of sums of lacunary
              series are scheduled.   Interspersed among these are planned a balanced number
              of  shorter talks.  Funds from this award are directed to support of  younger
              investigators, especially those who come from  underrepresented groups. 
              Generous cost-sharing will be provided  by the University of Virginia.      
              Real analysis forms the underpinning for many studies in the  mathematical
              sciences.  This particular research provides  a particularly valuable
              foundation in areas where  important applications can be expected, such as
              differential  equations, iterated function systems and fractal phenomena.  ***
