Abstract    :
              9402979  Leibovich    This  study  seeks  to  acquire a better understanding  of
               joint  effects of surface waves and turbulence in the upper ocean.   The 
              rationale  for the research is based on recent experiments  which  showed  
              that   turbulence  in  the  oceanic   mixed   layer   is  characterized  by  an
               important Langmuir circulation  component,  which is distinguished by the
              effect of surface waves.  The study  will  apply  large  eddy simulation (LES)
              to the  Craik-Leibovich  theory  of Langmuir circulation and the results will
              be  compared  with experimental data.    ***
