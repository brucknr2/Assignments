Abstract    :
                    9402727  Yang  The objective of this research is to study the
              self-strengthening  phenomenon in multilayered brittle materials.  These self 
              strengthening mechanisms could have a profound effect on the design  and
              fabrication of brittle materials.  To verify the proposed  mechanism, the
              failure of a submicron-thick film sandwiched between  two glass slides will be
              studied.  The completion of the proposed  study should provide a theoretical
              model and experimental data base  for understanding the nature of constrained
              failure of brittle  films and multilayers.  ***
