Abstract    :
                  9319878  Aktan  This is a proposal for research focused on deterioration
              mechanics  of aged steel truss bridges, to develop a rational approach for 
              quantitative assessment of the condition of these bridges.      The scope
              includes the following phases.  (1) An in-depth study of  the properties of
              chemically and mechanically aged and deteriorated  materials.  This phase will
              include a study of how the fundamental  characteristics of materials (including
              the fatigue properties)  change with age and are affected by deterioration. 
              (2) Laboratory  studies of six full-length built-up members salvaged from the
              two  destroyed highway bridges.  (3) Development of a practical  procedure for
              estimating the actual type and extent of  deterioration.  This procedure will
              enable predicting critical  responses of bridge members and of complete
              bridges; (5)  Calibration of the proposed analytical procedure by simulating
              the  experimental responses of the two highway bridges tested to  failure. 
              This calibration will be done through nonlinear system-  identification
              studies.
