Abstract    :
              9402655  Jean    This proposal provides funds to purchase a positron source and 
              pursue exploratory studies of a class of organic superconductor.   The
              materials are bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene complexes,  as well as the
              new fullerene C-60 materials.  The project involves  both experiment methods to
              determine the angular distribution of  positron annihilation in that materials,
              and quantum chemical  calculations to provide an interpretation of these data
              in terms of  the Fermi surface in these materials.  The results are of 
              fundamental interest but may also be of technical importance as  they provide
              information about the superconducting state in these  materials.  ***
