Abstract    :
              9402437  Brown    This grant will permit the author to complete the construction
              of  a high-pressure consolidometer in which he plans to replicate the 
              temperature/pressure conditions of an accretionary prism. Mixtures  of
              different sediments and porewaters will be subjected to varying  physical
              conditions for 1-2 months, in order to determine changes  in both physical and
              chemical conditions occurring deep within the  prism.
