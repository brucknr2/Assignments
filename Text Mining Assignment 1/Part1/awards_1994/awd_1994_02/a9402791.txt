Abstract    :
              9402791  Schaudt  The goal of this project is to investigate the
              multiplicatively  weighted crystal growth Voronoi diagram, by itself and by
              using a  k-gon distance function.  Algorithms will be devised, analyzed,  and
              implemented for both kind of  diagrams.  ***
