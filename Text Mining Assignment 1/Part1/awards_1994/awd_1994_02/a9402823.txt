Abstract    :
              9402823  Wickwar         This project will be a one-year collaboratory effort
              involving  Utah State University, the University of Maryland, Clemson 
              University, the University of Pittsburgh, and University College  London to
              upgrade its current capability to include a state-of-the-  art
              resonance-scatter lidar system.  In addition to significantly  enhancing the
              atmospheric science, the development of this  resonance lidar will mark the
              transfer of a well-tested laboratory  technique to study the atmosphere.  After
              its development and  initial use in Utah, the PIs will try this system, or part
              of it,  at the Polar Cap Observatory.  At this high-latitude location, the 
              observations could be very useful for examining the winds and  temperatures
              inside and outside the polar vortex as well as the  occurrence of ice clouds to
              determine temperature conditions at  time of formation.  ***
