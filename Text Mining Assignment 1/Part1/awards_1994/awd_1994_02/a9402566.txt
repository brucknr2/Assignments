Abstract    :
              9402566  Falzarano  This project deals with the analysis of multiple degrees-of 
              freedom on forced ship rolling using geometric methods. The  major emphasis of
              the project is on the coupling effect of  other motion modes on the critical
              roll motion leading to  improved dynamic models. Analytical techniques used
              include  Poincar  maps, invariant manifold intersections, Melnikov  vectors and
              lobe dynamics. The effects of  yaw coupling on  sway and roll are also
              considered. Systems of dimensions  greater than three are considered and a
              development of  decoupling and projection techniques is emphasized which 
              allows visualization in lower dimensional spaces without  neglecting
              significant dynamic details. Slowly varying  systems and nonlinear normal modes
              are utilized for computer  simulations.  ***
