Abstract    :
              9402397  Shine  This research is an experimental and theoretical study of a new 
              class of electroheological fluids. The properties of a liquid  crystalline
              solution in a hydrocarbon solvent of a rigid rod  polymer having a large
              permanent axial dipole moment will be  investigated. This research will
              integrate the molecular design  of the liquid crystalline polymer structure
              with the modeling of  the rheological material behavior when an electric field
              is  applied.  ***
