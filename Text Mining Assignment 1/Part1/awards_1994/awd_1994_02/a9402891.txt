Abstract    :
              9402891  de Szoeke    This  project consists of conducting long-term
              integrations (>100  years)  with  a global ocean model based on the
              Bleck-Boudra  GCM  with  massive parallel code developed at Oregon State 
              University  (OSU)  for  the TMC CM5 computer.  The focus of the study  is  on 
              improvements on the surface fluxes and mixed layer processes that  drive the
              thermohaline circulation of the world oceans.    A series of idealized process
              experiments will be run focusing on  mid-latitude wind- and buoyancy-driven
              flows, interaction of  mixed layer and sea ice in sub-polar regions, the role
              of eddies  in meridional transport of properties, and the influence of  bottom
              topography on mesoscale eddy dynamics.  After these  process experiments are
              completed, a fully global eddy-resolving  ocean circulation model will be run
              with 12 density layers and  1/6-degree mean horizontal resolution.    ***
