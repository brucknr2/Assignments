Abstract    :
              9402803  Duncan    This project will continue development of using Ar isotopes
              to  determine the ages of very young oceanic rocks. The PI is the only  person
              in the world who is attempting this technically challenging  technique.
              Preliminary results have been successful, and he  proposes to continue refining
              and testing his method by applying it  to several sets of rocks which have
              other age control. In  particular, he will compare the results of his method
              with those  obtained from U series dating.
