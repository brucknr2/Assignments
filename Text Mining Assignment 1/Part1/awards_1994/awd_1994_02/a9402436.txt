Abstract    :
              9402436  Elthon       The PIs observed isotopic disequilibrium between
              coexisting  minerals of cumulate gabbros from the Mid-Cayman Rise (MCR).  Their
              preliminary data indicate that exotic, interstitial fluid  may be responsible
              for much of the compositionally strange  features that characterize these
              rocks.  In this project the Pis  will undertake a detailed electron and ion
              probe study of these  rocks.  This will allow the PIs to characterize such an
              "exotic"  fluid.  `em
