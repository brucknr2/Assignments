Abstract    :
                     9402034  Morelli        This research involves two ethnographers studying
              why some  foragers in the Ituri forest of northeastern Zaire adopt farming  as
              a subsistence strategy, while others maintain relations with  local farmers in
              order to obtain the carbohydrate portion of  their diets.  The researchers will
              study economic decisions and  environmental constraints of a community of
              foragers every summer  (the annual "hunger season") for five years, measuring
              field  sizes and food availability as well as work input and labor 
              availability.  The hypothesis is that adoption of farming rather  than trading
              for farm foods will occur when shortfalls of  cultivated trade foods are
              frequent, severe, predictable and  regional in extent.        This research is
              important because understanding economic  behavior in the widest range of
              societies is necessary to  distinguish what is fundamental to human decision
              making under  scarcity and uncertainty from what is constrained by capitalist 
              market relations.  This sort of study of production and exchange  in primitive
              forest conditions will provide data that will help  social scientists advance
              our understanding of human economic  decision making.
