Abstract    :
              9402535  Gordaninejad  Innovative control systems for bridges and other
              large-scale  civil structures are needed for enhancing safety in the  event of
              earthquakes, strong winds and other man-made and  natural hazards. In this
              project, electro-rheological (ER)  fluid dampers, piezoceramic sensors and a
              self-adaptive  fuzzy logic controller will be developed to control the 
              response of bridge structures. The self-adaptive nature of  the fuzzy
              controller and condition under which the  controller may fail will be carefully
              examined by applying  different excitation forces and frequencies, and by using
               several different ER fluids and piezoceramic sensors. The  implementation of
              the proposed dampers will be examined  through earthquake simulations and
              analytical models of real  bridges.  ***
