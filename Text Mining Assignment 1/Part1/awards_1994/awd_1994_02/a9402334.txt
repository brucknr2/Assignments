Abstract    :
              9402334  Sanchis      This project involves investigation into various problems
              having to do with efficient construction and generation of structures.    In
              part it will include continued research in the area of generation of test cases
              for NP-hard problems.  As part of this effort, further investigation will be
              done on the construction of test cases for certain NP-hard graph problems,
              including the maximum clique problem and the dominating set problem.  This work
              will include both improvement of previous test case generating procedures, and
              consideration of new approaches.  In particular, the relationship between the
              hardness (both theoretical and experimental) of constructed test cases, and
              various instance parameters (such as the edge density of the graph) will be
              further investigated.  Some related extremal graph theory problems arising from
              the construction procedures will also be studied.    The project also involves
              more theoretical aspects of the generation and construction problems.  This
              area is concerned with the feasibility and/or complexity of the construction
              and generation problem for various types of languages and structures.  Some
              unanswered questions in this area will be further investigated.    ***
