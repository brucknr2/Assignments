Abstract    :
                  This award to an interdisciplinary group of scientists will develop both the
               theory and the tools both for integrating heterogeneous databases and for 
              querying them.  The immediate application of this work will be on data 
              generated by the genome community.  However, the need for such a tool is 
              broader than that community.  In particular the investigators will provide two 
              tools.  The first will be a view mechanism, which allows one to define a view 
              (in yet another data model) encompassing parts of several related databases,
              and  the second is a query language which can be used on this view.  This work
              is  being jointly supported by the Database Activity in the Biological Sciences
              and  the Database and Expert Systems Program.
