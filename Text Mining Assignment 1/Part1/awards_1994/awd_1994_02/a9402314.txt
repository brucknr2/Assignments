Abstract    :
              9402314  Kareiva   Models are playing an increasingly important role in resource
              management and conservation biology. These "applied ecological models" are used
              in a different spirit than basic ecological theory -- they are used to project
              scenarios or identify management options for particular species, and are based
              upon sketchy data often analyzed under tremendous time pressure. Typically,
              rather arbitrary decisions are made about model structure -- whether or not to
              include age and stage structure, how many age classes, what type of
              environmental variability should be included, should density dependence be
              considered, and so forth. Unfortunately, the implications of decisions about
              model structure are virtually never explored in even the most rudimentary
              fashion. In this Conservation and Restoration Biology research, the PI's will
              perform a computationally intense comparison of different resource management
              and viability models in which simulated data is modeled in different ways, and
              the performance of the different modeling approaches is contrasted. To ground
              these studies in real world problems, the PI's will also apply the same wide
              variety of models to two case studies: a viability model for the Northern
              Spotted Owl, and a harvesting model for the Serengeti wildebeest. The goals are
              threefold: (1) to use simulated data sets to understand how aspects of life
              history structure and environmental variability influence the sensitivity of
              model results to model structure, (2) to develop convenient computational
              approaches for evaluating different models when presented with real data, and
              (3) to alert applied ecologists to the danger of settling on one model
              structure without exploring alternatives.  %%%  This research will provide an
              important linkage between resource management, conservation biology, and
              ecological theory. The need to address the advantages and limitations of
              applied ecological models is paramount. Too often, decisions are made with
              incomplete data, and based on incomplete an alyses. This research will provide
              the basis for assessing the utility of various models for the conservation of
              species and management of natural resources.  ***
