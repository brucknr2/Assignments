Abstract    :
                   The Glossary of Meteorology has been a major reference tool in  the
              atmospheric and related sciences since its publication in 1959.   Given the
              growth of terminology over the past three decades, the  Glossary is overdue for
              a major update.  Under this award, the  update will be accomplished by making
              extensive use of a large  network of volunteer scientists who will serve as
              subject  specialists for the writing and reviewing of definitions of terms  for
              the Glossary.  A small permanent staff, headed by a chief  editor, will oversee
              and direct this enormous administrative effort  as well as provide guidance and
              editorial support to ensure the  technical consistency of the resulting updated
              volume.  Plans  include release of the Glossary in an electronic format as well
              as  in print.       Joining NSF in the support of this project are NOAA, DOE,
              DOD,  and EPA.
