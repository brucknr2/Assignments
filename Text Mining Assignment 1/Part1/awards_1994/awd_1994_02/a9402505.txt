Abstract    :
              9402505  Sigman    This award supports the foreign travel expenses  for Dr. Karl
              Sigman from the Department of  Industrial Engineering and Operations Research 
              at Columbia University to spend seven  months in early 1995 in Japan. Dr.
              Sigman will  be conducting theoretical research with  Professor Masakiyo
              Miyazawa of the Department  of Information Sciences at the Science  University
              of Tokyo in the area of fluid flow  approximation in open networks.    Discrete
              objects such as bits of data, jobs,  and customers, arriving over time to a
              facility  can be approximated as a flow  of a fluid. The purpose of this study
              is to  obtain approximations and bounds for system  performance in the case
              when primitives of the  model, such as the arrival and processing  mechanisms,
              are general processes.  Such  approximations and bounds are of interest in 
              areas as diverse as telecommunications,  manufacturing and finance, where real
              systems  are becoming increasingly complex and are not  easily analyzed through
              classic queuing  methods.    Fluid flow models of discrete systems are of 
              interest as providing tools for the analysis of  systems that are important yet
              mathematically  intractable. This project brings together the   related
              research interests of Dr. Sigman in the  importance of fluid flow approximation
              to  queuing networks with the expertise of Prof.  Miyazawa, one of the world's
              ranking queuing  theorists.    This award is funded under the auspices of the 
              Center for Global Partnership (CGP) of the  Japan Foundation under the NSF-CGP 
              Science Fellowship Program.  ***
