Abstract    :
              9402469  Taylor       In this project the PIs will investigate the relationship 
              between rift-related and arc-related volcanism behind the  volcanic front of
              Izu arc using a combination of field studies  and geochemistry.  In these arcs
              rift and cross-chain arc  volcanism occur at similar distances from the slab
              and overlap in  eruption ages.  The PIs will also sample the across arc
              seamounts  in the Izu region.  They wish to analyze the samples for trace 
              elements and isotopes.  They argue that by studying arc magmas  further away
              from the trench region they can get a much better  handle on the nature of the
              wedge mantle.  They will also be able  to determine whether the invasion of an
              enriched mantle component  is a prerequisite to rifting.  ***
