Abstract    :
              Natural Language and Robot Planning, Part 2:  An Empirical Approach    This
              project uses a robot which has incomplete knowledge of its  environment and
              must acquire additional knowledge through sensors  to carry out human commands,
               allowing the exploration of issues in  robotic planning and control and
              natural language interaction with  an active agent.  The speaker giving the
              directions is provided  with a three-dimensional graphic display that provides
              knowledge of  how the robot is positioned within the building and how it is 
              responding to the commands.  The approach to developing the human-  robot
              system will be to have humans work in pairs, with each acting  as the robot in
              turn.  In this way, the syntactic and semantic  aspects of the way humans react
              in this situation and their  interaction with the situation pragmatics can be
              studied.   Naturally, the directions given depend upon and will be interpreted 
              within the context of the robot at a given time, so the task is  designed to
              provide a concrete laboratory for the study of the  problems of context which
              are difficult enough to raise important  issues but easy enough to expect
              insights.
