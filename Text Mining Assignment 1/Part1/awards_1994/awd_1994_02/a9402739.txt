Abstract    :
              9402739  Caffarelli       This award supports a continuation of the successful 
              Regional Geometry Institutes (RGI).  The defining feature of the  RGI has been
              the integration of researchers, graduate students,  undergraduates, and high
              school teachers in a structured  environment that allow all members to attain
              deeper understanding  of the mathematical sciences enterprise as a whole.  The
              project  is designed to increase mutual respect and understanding among  the
              groups, while advancing scholarship and learning.  In a  supportive setting
              where education at all levels is the explicit  concern, participants can make
              connections that are difficult or  impossible to achieve in their home
              locations.   The RGI is  managed by a small, decentralized group of
              mathematical  scientists and educators.  The Institute for Advanced Study 
              proposes to become the institutional leader of this program,   called the Park
              City/IAS Mathematics Institute.  The site for the  activity for the summer of
              1994 will be at Park City, Utah.  ***
