Abstract    :
              9402443  Jayaraman    This project will explore, characterize and attempt to
              rationalize  pressure-induced phase transitions in some select rare earth 
              containing oxide materials using mainly Raman and infrared  spectroscopy to
              pressures up to 50 giga pascals.  Pressure-induced  phase transitions including
              amorphization are observed in these  systems.  It is hoped to establish
              criteria for pressure-induced  amorphization by investigating the detailed
              behavior of some select  molybdates at high pressure and elevated temperature. 
              In one of  the rare earth oxides it is hoped to achieve metallization at 
              pressures near 40 giga pascals and test the exciting possibility of  high Tc
              superconductivity.  Pressure induced transitions in certain  perovskite oxides
              will be investigated.  The stability of the  perovskite structure at high
              pressure and temperature will be  examined.  The results will be significant to
              materials science as  well as to earth science.     % % % %    High pressure is
              a route to transform materials into novel states,  of interest to science and
              technology.  The most spectacular  example in this context is the well known
              conversion of graphite to  diamond under high pressure and temperature. 
              Current advances in  pressure generation techniques using the diamond cell make
              it  possible to subject materials to hitherto inaccessble regions of 
              simultaneous high pressure and temperature.  New pressure-induced  phase
              transitions with new material properties are distinct  possibilities, such as
              driving many insulators into metallic state,  and in some cases even into
              superconductors.  Surprisingly many  oxide systems turn into a new type of
              glasses at high pressure.   The present project will focus on several oxide
              systems which bear  the promise of yielding new material states of interest to 
              technological applications and to basic science.  ***
