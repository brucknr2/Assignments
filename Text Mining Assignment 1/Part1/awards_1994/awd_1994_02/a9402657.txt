Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9402657  Overpeck, Jonathan T.  Miller, Gifford H.  University of
              Colorado  Title: A PALE Lake Sediment Calibration Network for the Eastern 
              Canadian Arctic    This award supports a PALE/ARCSS effort to construct a
              high-quality  dataset for surficial lake sediment calibration in the eastern 
              Canadian Arctic.  A detailed sampling and analysis program will  allow the
              development of new calibration data for fossil pollen,  isotopic and
              palelimnological proxies.  Modern numerical analysis  will be applied to
              existing lake-based fossil pollen records to  produce a new generation of
              quantitative paleoclimate estimates.   This work will result in a large
              public-domain database, and will  make a collection of surface lake sediments
              available to the  paleoclimate community for additional research.
