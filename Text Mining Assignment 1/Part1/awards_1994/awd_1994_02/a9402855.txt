Abstract    :
              9402855  Etter                          PROJECT ABSTRACT           The deep sea
              is an environment that covers more than  two-thirds of the earth's surface, yet
              little is known about  the processes that have generated the rich and endemic
              deep-  sea fauna.  Molecular techniques offer a unique method for  addressing
              fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions  that would otherwise by
              intractable in this remote and alien  environment.  This study will quantify
              geographic variation  from existing collections of deep-sea mollusks using 
              contemporary molecular genetic tools, document patterns of  genetic variation,
              and test specific hypotheses related to  those patterns.  In addition, the
              research will quantify the  population genetic structure of several species
              from two  important deep-sea taxa (gastropods and bivalves) arrayed  along a
              depth gradient in the western north Atlantic.  Using  patterns of genetic
              variation, the Principal Investigator  will determine if genetic divergence
              among conspecific  populations decreases with depth paralleling observed 
              patterns of phenotypic distance.  The research will also  provide estimates of
              gene flow, identify the structure of  deep-sea populations and provide new
              molluscan-specific  primers for use in genetic studies.
