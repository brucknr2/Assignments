Abstract    :
              9402209  Kane       A workshop in elementary particle physics, focusing on 
              "supersymmetry," will be held in May, 1994 at the University of  Michigan. 
              Supersymmetry predicts that each already-known  particle, such as a quark, an
              electron, or a photon, is actually  accompanied in nature by a so-far
              undiscovered partner with a  different intrinsic spin angular momentum.  The
              symmetry between  the known particles and their predicted partners makes it 
              possible to understand how the range of the weak nuclear force,  though
              microscopic, can nevertheless be so very much larger than  the extremely short
              distance at which the various forces of  nature are thought to become unified. 
              There has been much recent  progress in supersymmetry, and a workshop where
              active  participants in this field can exchange ideas will be very  timely.
