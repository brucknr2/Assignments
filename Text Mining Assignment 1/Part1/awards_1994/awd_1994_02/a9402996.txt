Abstract    :
              9402996  Ho  This SBIR Phase II project is for the continued development of a 
              very sensitive and portable fluoroimmunoassay device that uses  disposable
              cells having a polymer antibody support capable of  multichannel multicomponent
              analysis.  These devices are  potentially useful in many medical and clinical
              diagnostics seen  in intensive or emergency care patients.  Physical Optics
              Corp.  will develop a highly parallel and sensitive fluoroimmunoassay 
              holographic optical waveguide for the monitoring of biological  systems.  This
              unique latex-based waveguide has excellent optical  quality and an established
              immunochemistry, making it stable and  reliable for sensing applications
              because the polymer-based  waveguide probe is inexpensive and disposable, and
              the waveguide  cartridge is suitable for one time assay.  During the Phase II 
              program, the proposed system will be specifically used for  therapeutic drug
              monitoring.  ***
