Abstract    :
              9402653  Hennage  This award is to support partial travel cost of students to
              the 1994 Diffractive Optics: Design, Fabrication and Applications Topical
              Meeting, presented by the Optical Society of America.    Diffractive or binary
              optics are finding new and interesting applications in both commercial and
              military markets, providing the potential to significantly reduce size, weight
              and cost of optical systems which currently use refractive and/or reflective
              optical components.  The aim of this conference is to foster discussion among
              scientists and engineers contributing to, or interested in, current research
              issues, fabrication methods, new developments and applications of diffractive
              optics.  ***
