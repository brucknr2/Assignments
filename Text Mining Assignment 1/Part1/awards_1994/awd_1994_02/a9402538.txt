Abstract    :
                9402538  Ward         This proposal will investigate the relationship between 
              the oceanic oxygen minimum zone and denitrification and  nitrification using a
              combination of traditional  15N tracer  methods and immunological probes t
              characterize the  distribution of the bacterial assemblages involved in the 
              transformations.  The study site in the Eastern Tropical  North Pacific (ETNP)
              will present a  range of conditions  including well oxygenated surface waters, 
              oxygen minima of  varying intensities, and oceanic deep water.  Due to the 
              small scale sampling and smaller volume incubations made  possible by improved
              isotope probes, the investigators will  study the bacteriological properties on
              a scale approaching  that possible for chemical variables.  This will allow a 
              determination of the extent to which nitrification and  denitrification overlap
              and interact in the spectrum of  oxygen conditions of the ETNP.
