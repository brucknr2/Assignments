Abstract    :
              9402775  Longo    This award will support Kael Hanson's dissertation research in
               particle physics at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory near  Rome, Italy,
              under the direction of Professor Carlo Bemporad of  the University of Pisa,
              Italy.  Mr. Hanson will use data from the  Monopole and Astrophysical Cosmic
              Ray Observatory (MACRO).  He  will study upward-going electron neutrino
              interactions and will  measure the ratio of upward-going electron neutrinos to
              muon  neutrinos.      While considerable effort has been devoted within the
              MACRO  collaboration to upward-going muons, it has not been possible to  look
              at upward-going electrons until the addition of an "attico,"  which makes it
              possible to identify upward-going electron events  at a modest rate.  This is a
              topical problem.  There is at  present a discrepancy in some published
              measurements of the muon  neutrino flux which hints at neutrino oscillations
              and a non-zero  neutrino mass.   * * *
