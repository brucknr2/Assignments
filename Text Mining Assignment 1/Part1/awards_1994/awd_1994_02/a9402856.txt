Abstract    :
              A detailed study of the physical processes controlling the  retroflection and
              separation of the Agulhas current off the coast  of South Africa will be
              conducted using the Princeton Ocean Model  with various local and forcing
              conditions. The realism of the  numerical simulations will be assessed by
              conducting a descriptive  study of the region using satellite altimetry and
              historical  hydrographic data.
