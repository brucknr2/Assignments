Abstract    :
               This research addresses various areas of  cryptography that have a significant
              interaction with  combinatorics.  The three  primary areas of research are: (1)
              secret sharing schemes;   (2) authentication codes; and (3) resilient 
              functions.    Secret-sharing schemes allow shared computation  of a  secret key
              by certain specified groups of people; they  have applications in any  scenario
              where shared access or  shared control is important.    codes are a 
              fundamental cryptographical tool used to guarantee that  information has not
              been altered, and that it originated  with the intended  sender.    Resilient
              functions are a type of  cryptographic function that have  application to
              different  problems, including designing of stream and block  ciphers  and key
              exchange protocols.   All of these areas  involve  combinatorial theory in an
              essential way.  Combinatorial designs, graph theory,  error-correcting codes, 
              and linear programming all play an important role in  this work.
