Abstract    :
              9402020  Orlando  Technical abstract:  The  diffusive  and  ballistic motion  of
               vortices  in  one  and  two  dimensional  arrays  of  Josephson  junctions 
              will  be  studied  both  experimentally  and  numerically. By using   niobium 
              arrays  we  will  explore  a new physical regime where the penetration depth is
               smaller  than the unit cell of the array. These investigations will be used 
              to  model  vortex  motion, to study coherent motion of  vortices,  and  to 
              study  novel  phase-locked solutions of non-linear dynamical  systems.  With 
              sub-micron  size  junctions, the arrays  can  exhibit  ballistic  motion of the
              vortices and give rise to mesoscopic transport which.    Non-technical
              abstract:  Josephson  junctions form the basis of most devices in
              superconducting  electronics. We will study a lattice of such devices coupled
              together.  In  such a lattice the magnetic field is bound in bundles of
              quantized  magnetic flux called vortices. These arrays allow one to study 
              vortex  motion in new regimes where motion can be ballistic and can give  rise 
              to  novel  collective  states  that  are  coherent   or  even  quantum 
              mechanical.  By understanding such motion one will be able  to  design  more 
              efficient and novel superconducting electronic devices. One  can  also  add   
              to the understanding of quantum mechanical effects  which  occur  on 
              macroscopic  (rather  than  atomic)  lengths  and  to   the  understanding of
              new non-linear effects in dynamical systems.  ***
