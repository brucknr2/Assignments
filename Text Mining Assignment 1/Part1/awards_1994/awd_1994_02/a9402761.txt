Abstract    :
              9402761  Kolata  This grant will support a wide-ranging program of basic
              research  in the areas of nuclear reactions, nuclear structure, and nuclear 
              astrophysics to be conducted in the Nuclear Structure Laboratory  of the
              University of Notre Dame, and at other major nuclear  research facilities in
              the US and elsewhere.  The areas of  interest include the study of the
              synthesis of heavy elements in  the Big Bang and in explosive hydrogen-burning
              processes, the  production and use of radioactive nuclear beams, and the study
              of  exotic nuclear systems such as superdeformed and hyperdeformed  states and
              the "halo" nuclei that occur near the neutron- (and  possibly the proton-) drip
              line.  Multiphonon vibrations in  deformed nuclei, and the "giant resonance"
              phenomenon, will also  be investigated.  Finally, a new component, recently
              added to the  research programs at the laboratory, is the study of weak 
              interactions and fundamental processes in nuclear systems.  The  research
              program at the Notre Dame Nuclear Structure Laboratory  has emphasized
              extensive collaboration with experimental and  theoretical physicists at other
              universities.  This mode of  operation will continue under the proposed grant,
              as will our own  use of such new or anticipated research tools as Gammashpere,
              the  radioactive nuclear beam facility at Oak Ridge National  Laboratory, and
              the S800 spectrograph at Michigan State  University.
