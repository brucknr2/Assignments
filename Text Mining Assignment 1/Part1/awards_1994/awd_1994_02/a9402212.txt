Abstract    :
              9402212  Hamilton         This is the first phase of a major research project to
              study  social and psychological consequences of military base closing in 
              Russia and the United States.  A cross-disciplinary and cross-  cultural team
              of researchers will survey soldiers, their spouses,  and civilians in
              surrounding communities and will intervene with  selected subsamples to
              evaluate attempts to alleviate problems  associated with unemployment.  By
              conducting parallel studies in  two societies with very different economic,
              social, and cultural  conditions, this study will evaluate the stability of
              findings  concerning the effects of unemployment, while documenting the  social
              consequences of military demobilization.  %%%       By bringing together teams
              of researchers in Russia and the  United States, this project contributes to
              mutual understanding in  the crucial area of downsizing of these nations'
              military  establishments.  The results of the research are expected to 
              contribute directly to sociology, psychology and social-psychology.  
              Unemployment and other negative unintended consequences of  demilitarization
              threaten the benefits Americans hope to gain with  the end of the Cold War, and
              this study will improve the knowledge  base on which policy-makers can make
              their decisions.    ***
