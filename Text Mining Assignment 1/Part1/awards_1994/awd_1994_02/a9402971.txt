Abstract    :
              9402971  Bowen            This project will quantify genetic variation and
              evolutionary  relationships within the Clupeoid genera Sardinops and Engraulis.
                These two taxa, commonly known as sardines and anchovies, are  pelagic filter
              feeders typically found in warm-temperate coastal  waters and have great
              commercial importance.  The taxonomic and  systematic distinctions between
              regional forms of these two genera  remains unresolved despite the intense
              interest in means by which  these fish have been dispersed throughout the
              ocean.  This study  will use mtDNA geneologies to elucidate the pattern of
              colonization  among regional forms.  A second goal of this study will be to 
              estimate mtDNA clonal diversity within regional forms of Sardinops  and
              Engraulis.  Finally, mtDNA data will be used to assess the  level of gene flow
              among putative sardine stocks along the west  coast of North America.  These
              results have strong implications for  fishery assessment, as reproductive
              populations are the fundamental  units of species management.
