Abstract    :
              9402637  Baartmans       The second Upper Michigan Workshop on Codes, Designs,
              and  Geometries will be held in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in July   1994. This
              four day workshop will cover the latest results on   Designs, Codes, and Finite
              Geometries. The workshop leaders will  include some of the world's premiere
              experts in these areas.        The mathematical objects that mathematicians
              call Designs,  Codes and Geometries form the basic structures many scientists 
              use to classify things. Through the study of the structure of  these simple
              objects,  mathematicians provide these other  scientists with hints about the
              nature of their classification  schemes.  Also,  these mathematical objects can
              have their own  direct applications.  Mathematical codes,  for example,  are an
               essential part of electronic communication.  They are the basic  building
              block in Compact Disks and Computer Modems.
