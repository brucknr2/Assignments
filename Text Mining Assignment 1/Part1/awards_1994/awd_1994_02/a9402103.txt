Abstract    :
              9402103  Abstract  Turpen  The interaction of plants and their viruses present
              unique  opportunities for the production of complex molecules. Tobacco  Mosaic
              Virus (TMV) is the type member of the tobamovirus group and  is one of the best
              understood viruses in all aspects of their  biology. Using existing technology
              for the construction of  recombinant RNA viruses and transgenic hosts, we
              propose to use  viral RNA amplification for the synthesis of defined products
              in  plants. In Phase II, we will determine the necessary and optimal 
              configuration of episomal sequences to achieve the goal of  controlled and
              biologically contained, high level gene expression  in whole plants.  %%%  The
              most highly expressed genes in plants are found encoded in  plant RNA viral
              genomes. In order to develop a plant virus as a  gene vector, we will design
              constructs which retain the ability to  generate infectious recombinants and,
              as such, will no longer be  limited in their use as gene vectors. Thus, the
              production of  complex molecules on a commercial basis will be greatly
              optimized.  ***
