Abstract    :
              The sintering process is generic to powder processing of  materials, and is
              important both in powder metallurgy, reactive  and refractive metals, and
              ceramic fabrication.  Concerns with  respect to material properties and
              microstructure quality create  interest in control of the sintering process. 
              Beyond time and  temperature control, the heating and cooling rates, as well as
               the sintering environment prove crucial to successful sintering  of materials.
               This furnace system is an important step in  developing a  better
              understanding of enhanced sintering  processes and full density sintering. 
              This furnace system will  allow new materials research with an emphasis on
              processing  factors and their impact on the microstructure-property links in 
              sintered materials.  Research applications range from austentitic  stainless
              steels to titanium aluminides, and includes areas  relevant to the processing
              and manufacturing of advanced  materials. The furnace will be located in the
              Particulate  Materials Center at Penn State and will be available for use by 
              the PI and the entire faculty.
