Abstract    :
              9402101   Lindeman  The Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System
              (IHETS) on  behalf of its member institutions, is encouraging participation  in
              the data network for all higher education institutions in  Indiana and their
              constituents, including public libraries,  hospitals, governmental agencies,
              extension centers, and  businesses with research and educational needs for
              connectivity.  Additionally, IHETS is working with the Indiana Department of 
              Education to provide experimentation opportunities for schools  via linkage
              with the Department's dial-access system, IDEAnet.    This proposal requests
              partial funding for participation in  NSFNET through a connection with CICNET,
              the regional network  attaching to NSFNET in the Indiana Area as well as
              partial start-  up funds for the necessary routers, circuits, and operating 
              support to facilitate the fullest possible participation.  The  educational
              institutions that will participate include: Indiana  Institute of Technology,
              Oakland City College, Vincennes  University Technology Center, and the Allen
              County Public  Library.    The network initially consists of a redundant T1
              backbone linking  nodes at four of the larger campuses, 56 kbs DDS end nodes,
              and  connection to CICNET and NSFNET via Indiana University.  Phase 3  will
              extend to the new component of IHETS formed in 1992, the  Partnership for
              Statewide Education.  The new component of IHETS  will be critical in assuring
              that students enrolled in all  courses have access to information resources and
              student services  approximately those commonly available to their peers at 
              traditional campuses.    The Allen County public Library will serve as a model
              and test  site for various forms of connectivity for public libraries.
