Abstract    :
              9402830  EMERSON    This is a study of the geochemistry of Mo, V, U, and Re in a
              series  of cores on the continental margins of the Atlantic, Pacific, and 
              Indian Oceans. These elements are conservative, or nearly so, in  sea water and
              highly enriched in sediments overlain by anoxic or  very low oxygen-content
              bottom water.  The concentration of these  elements in sea water may have
              changed in the past in response to  the changing area of anoxic sediments in
              the ocean. Quantitative  interpretation of the changes, however, requires
              better  understanding of how these elements behave in continental margin 
              sediments.  Thus, their burial rates over the past 20 Ka. will be  studied in
              five box-core transects from the continental shelf to  the deep sea.  Cores
              from the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean  continental margins were raised on
              previous pore water  investigations, and sediments from a transect across the
              oxygen  minimum zone in the Arabian Sea to be sampled in the Indian Ocean 
              Program in 1995, will be provided from other investigations.  In  the latter
              study, a year-long suite of sediment trap samples will  also be analyzed.  All
              transects cross a strong gradient in  sediment redox conditions, and some also
              experience dramatic  changes in the level of bottom water oxygen concentration.
               Both  the organic carbon rain rate to the sediment-water interface and  the
              bottom water oxygen concentration influence the burial rate of  these metals
              and will be determined.
