Abstract    :
              9402288  Negishi  The focus of this research is the development of carbon-carbon
               bond making and bond breaking processes that use zirconium  mediated
              methodology.  Bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium  derivatives are used to probe a
              wide range of organometallic  reactions that involve catalysis and have the
              potential for  enantioselectivity.  %%%  With this renewal award, the Synthetic
              Organic Program is  supporting the research of Dr. Ei-Ichi Negishi of the 
              Department of Chemistry at Purdue University.  Professor  Negishi will focus
              his efforts on developing new catalytic  methods for the formation and breaking
              of carbon-carbon bonds.  Organometallic reactions featuring zirconium reagents
              are the  key to the strategy.  ***
