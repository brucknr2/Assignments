Abstract    :
              9402060  Cande  A DeepTow survey of magnetic anomalies 5 and 20 at two sites in 
              the northeast Pacific will be conducted.  The objective is to  estimate the
              contribution of deeper sources to magnetic anomalies  by measuring changes in
              the spectral character of the magnetic  field and the width of transition zones
              over crust of varying age  at both deep-two and mid-tow depths.  The data will
              be used to  evaluate models predicting long period temporal variations in the 
              magnetization of the upper oceanic crust due to progressive low  temperature
              oxidation and the possible emergence of a significant  paleofield signal from
              deeper within the crust.  ***
