Abstract    :
                    The principle aims of this project on "Information Processing for 
              Arabidopsis cDNA sequencing" are to design and implement enabling  informatics
              mechanisms for genetic sequence data and to provide  an automated environment
              (for similarity searching) for the  genetic sequence data produced by the
              molecular biologists for  the Arabidopsis cDNA sequencing project at Michigan
              State  University. This system will assist molecular biologists in  managing
              raw sequence data, annotations to it and results from  sequence comparisons.
              This system will allow the scientists to  organize and manipulate their
              sequence data in private local  databases and also automatically submit
              selected sequences to the  public databases of the research community. The
              system will be  based on a object-oriented database management system. The 
              investigators will make available to the community all raw and  derived data,
              software and documentation that they develop. This  project is also being
              supported by the Directorate for Biological  Sciences Reserve for the
              Arabidopsis Initiative.
