Abstract    :
              9402186  HASSETT    Due to the dramatic and sometimes catastrophic consequences 
              of red  tides, toxic dinoflagellates have been intensively studied  over the 
              years. However, relatively few of these studies have dealt  with  effects of
              dinoflagellates on zooplankton. The main  objective of  this project is to
              determine how the dinoflagellates,  Alexandrium  tamarensis and Scrippsiella
              trochoidea act upon the copepod  digestive system and metabolism. These studies
              will examine  if  different copepod species have different susceptibilities 
              and how  these relate to feeding history and nutritional status, and  will 
              determine if other dinoflagellate species have similar  impacts on  copepods.
              This project will use visual description and  morphometric  analyses of the gut
              cells of several copepods feeding upon  the 2  species of dinoflagelattes in
              laboratory experiments.  Analyses of  gut morphology will be conducted at both
              the light and  electron-  microscope level , and also will include observations
              of the  digestive system of live copepods under light microscope.  Changes  in
              physiological rates (digestive enzyme activities,  metabolic  enzyme
              activities, excretion rate, and respiration rate) and  feeding rate also will
              be determined to assess the  consequences of  ingesting a toxic dinoflagellate
              or of being exposed to  dinoflagellate toxins. After establishing the
              interactions  between  copepods and the two dinoflagellates, this project will
              use  the  knowledge gained as a basis for a survey of impacts of other 
              dinoflagellate species on copepods.
