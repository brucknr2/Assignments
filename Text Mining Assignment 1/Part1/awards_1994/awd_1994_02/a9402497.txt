Abstract    :
              9402497  Tribble  Deep-sea cores provide the basic raw material for studies in 
              paleoceanography, paleoclimatology, sediment dynamics, and  chemical
              oceanography.  The curation facilities provide an  invaluable service to the
              marine geology and geophysics and  chemical oceanographic communities.  Funds
              are provided for the  continued support for three years of the core repository
              at  University of Hawaii.  These funds will defray the costs of core  handling,
              description, curation, sample distribution and data  management.  ***
