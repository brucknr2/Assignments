Abstract    :
              9402187  Khalil  It is proposed to conduct research on the design of robust
              output  feedback control of a class of nonlinear systems.  The class of 
              systems to be considered is the class of input-output  linearizable systems,
              which arise in many applications such as  robotics manipulators, aircraft
              control, and electric machines.   The design procedure starts with the design
              of a robust state  feedback control followed by the design of a robust observer
              to  recover robustness achieved with state feedback.  The performance  of such
              observers are usually hindered by difficulties due to  measurement noise and
              excessively large transient response.  A  recent result by the principal
              investigator has show that, for  the special case of fully linearizable
              systems, the undesirable  transient behavior can be eliminated by designing the
              feedback  control to be globally bounded.  This proposal aims at developing  a
              comprehensive theory for the design of globally bounded output  feedback
              controllers.  Problems to be investigated include  tracking, disturbance
              rejection, servomechanisms, robustness,  comparison of various state estimation
              schemes, and study of the  effect of measurement noise.  ***
