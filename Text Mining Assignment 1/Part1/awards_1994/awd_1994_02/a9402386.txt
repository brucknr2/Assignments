Abstract    :
              9402386  McMechan    This research is to develop field experiment designs, data 
              acquisition strategies and software for quantitative analysis and 
              interpretation of ground penetrating radar (GPR) data.  There is an  increasing
              emphasis on shallow, high-resolution geophysical  techniques for a wide variety
              of applications, including  environmental investigations.  In the past, GPR
              images were  generally interpreted with only rudimentary processing because 
              nothing else was available.  With the advent of high quality  digitally
              recording GPR systems, new doors have been opened  allowing extensive,
              quantitative data imaging and inversion  techniques to be applied to GPR data. 
              This work will take  advantage of extensive 3-D seismic inversion development
              for this  new application.    ***
