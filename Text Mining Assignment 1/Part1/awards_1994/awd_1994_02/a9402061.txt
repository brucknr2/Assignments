Abstract    :
              9402061  Sivjee         The PIs propose to build a CEDAR Class I high throughput
               imaging spectroscopic system for ground-based remote-sensing of  polar middle
              and upper atmosphere airglow and auroral processes at  the Polar Cap
              Observatory site in Resolute Bay.  The new optical  facility will have "Class I
              instruments" capable of attaining CEDAR  goals of using "state-of-the-art
              technology to achieve greater  sensitivity, better spatial and temporal
              resolution and new  measurement capabilities."  Among the many aeronomic
              research  projects that can be undertaken (with greater accuracy and spatial 
              as well as temporal resolutions) are:  (1) derivation of N and O  densities in
              the thermosphere, and (2) investigation of the  excitation mechanisms for
              highly dynamic transient phenomena such  as type-B red aurora.  ***
