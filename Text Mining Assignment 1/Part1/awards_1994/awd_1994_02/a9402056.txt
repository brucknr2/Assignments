Abstract    :
              9402056  Routbort    Support is requested for the graduate students'
              participation at  the conference "Plastic Deformation of Ceramics" to be held
              at  Snowbird, Utah, August 7-12, 1994.  At this meeting there will be  a world
              renowned scientist over viewing the field of high  strength ceramics and some
              important issues related to those e.g.  creeping, deformation, superplasticity
              and many more important  structural ceramics problems.  The conference seeks
              support from  NSF at the level of $10,000 for the students' participation.  %%%
               Structural and light weight Ceramics are some of the important  issues of the
              near future.  There are several structural and  mechanical properties
              understandings which are needed before  those can be used in some practical
              areas.  This conference  discusses the advances in this field and concludes the
              needs and  future research directions in this area.  ***
