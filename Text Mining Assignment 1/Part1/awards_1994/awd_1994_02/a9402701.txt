Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the continuation of a search for an  electron electric
              dipole (EDM) moment using a high precision  cesium magnetometer.  The existence
              of an EDM in cesium  would indicate a violation of the principle of
              time-reversal  invariance (T).  Thus far, only one violation of T is known, 
              the K-meson system.  The discovery of a new system that  violates T could allow
              one to determine which of the many  theories that describe this violation is
              correct.  The  proposal also seeks to continue the development of a new 
              experimental that tests Einstein's postulate of local  Lorentz Invariance by
              comparing the frequencies of  magnetometers as the earth rotates.
