Abstract    :
              9402300  Dube  Geometric algorithms arise in many application areas.  The non- 
              robustness of such algorithms is of major concern.  As geometric  algorithms
              are characterized by the presence of both numerical  and combinatorial
              elements, non-robustness problems here appear  more intractable than in purely
              numerical computation.  Evidence  suggests that current implementation
              approaches, based on machine  floating-point arithmetic, are fundamentally
              inadequate in  dealing with non-robustness.    This project proposes to use
              exact computation for implementing  such algorithms.  This is a fundamentally 
              new computing paradigm  that includes a rich set of computational tactics. 
              Initial  analysis indicates that exact computation can be quite effective  for
              an important class of problems (the rational bounded-depth  problems).  The two
              goals of the research are          To establish the practical viability of this
              approach.          To investigate the theoretical bases for exact  computation.
                 The practical goal involves the design of key software packages,  and to
              apply this to a significant application area.  A new topic  here is the area of
              precision-sensitive algorithms, which  promises to stimulate new algorithmic
              research on problems which  seems intractable using traditional complexity
              parameters.  ***
