Abstract    :
              9402852  Plant    The adequacy and limitations of the Bragg scattering/composite
               surface theory of microwave backscatter from rough surfaces for  understanding
              the dynamics of centimeter scale wind-generated waves  will be determined by
              analyzing the results of a extensive  laboratory experiment.
