Abstract    :
              9402995  Buck       Numerical models of mantle flow and melting will be used to 
              model the dynamic support of MOR axial highs considering the  physical
              parameters governing subridge mantle flow and melting  that are consistent with
              data on axial highs and axial lows.  In  addition to axial strength, cohesion
              of the lithosphere will be  considered.  Detailed two-dimensional models of the
              effect of  normal fault offsets that allow for elastic, plastic and viscous 
              behaviors in the lithosphere will be constructed.  ***
