Abstract    :
                9402647  Dahm    Technical abstract:  The properties of electrons in two
              dimensions  will be investigated using semiconductor heterostructures and 
              electrons on helium films.  Studies will be carried out in the  variable-range
              hopping regime in gated heterostructures.  A search  will be made for a
              predicted Coulomb gap in the density of states.   The magnetic field dependence
              of the localization length will be  studied in an attempt to measure the energy
              of the "floating"  delocalization states.  The conduction properties of a
              pinned  electron crystal on a liquid helium film will be carried out.  This  is
              a model sliding charge-density wave with a coupling to  "impurities" (substrate
              potentials) which can be varied through a  wide range by changing the film
              thickness.    Non-technical abstract:  The aim of this study is to achieve a 
              better understanding of the laws of physics governing two-  dimensional
              systems.  The investigations span the spectrum of  interest from a classical
              system of electrons on a helium surface  to the quantum limit of electrons in
              semiconductors.  The study of  two-dimensional electrons in semiconductors is
              closely related to  the 2D Hall effect and results from this study may have 
              applications to electronic devices.  Electrons on a helium surface  form a
              model system to study properties of phenomena which occur in  three dimensions
              within a more limited set of variables.  ***
