Abstract    :
              9402360  Perfit    The PIs collected samples by rock coring and Alvin dives
              (Adventure  I & II Cruises) on the ridge crest and flanks from EPR 9N area. In 
              this project, they will obtain U-Th dates and geochemical analyses  of these
              samples, and combine them with their photo interpretation  to check their 3-D
              model of the magmatic system beneath fast-  spreading ridge. Their goal is to
              determine magma residence times  and magma residence times and magma generation
              and fractionation  processes.
