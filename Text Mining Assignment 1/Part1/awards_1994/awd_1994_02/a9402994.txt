Abstract    :
              9402994  Helgason       Helgason will continue his work on existence questions
              for  invariant differential operators and on operational problems for  integral
              operators on symmetric spaces.  Vogan will continue his  work on
              representations of special topological groups.  At  present the most urgent
              problem is to find all the ways in which  a given group can be realized as a
              group of unitary operators on  a Hilbert space.  Vogan will concentrate on
              realizations when the  group is the unitary group of an indefinite Hermitian
              quadratic  form.       The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
              Norwegian  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in 
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for  exploiting the
              symmetries inherent in a system, the  representation theory of Lie groups has
              had a profound impact  upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and
              number  theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum  mechanics and
              elementary particle physics.  ***
