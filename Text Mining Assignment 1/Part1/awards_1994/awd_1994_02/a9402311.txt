Abstract    :
                  9402311  Azizinamini  Concern for safety and lack of information has
              resulted in the ACI  318-89 building code imposing a 10,000 psi limitation on
              concrete  compressive strength, that can be utilized  in the design process 
              when calculating tension development length of reinforcing bars.   This
              limitation is a result of the fact that the current code  requirements are
              based on test data form specimens with compressive  strengths in the range of
              3,000 to 6,000 psi; however, concrete  with compressive strength exceeding
              14,000 psi is being used in  construction.      The overall objective of the
              research is to develop a unified  theoretical model that would explain the
              behavior of deformed bars  embedded in concrete of any compressive strength. 
              Of particular  interest is the case of concrete with compressive strength 
              exceeding 14,000 psi.  Further, it is intended that the research  findings be
              provided in the code language format, adoptable by  code-writing organizations.
