Abstract    :
              9402439  Glymour  This project will apply to large medical databases a variety 
              of  state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques that have  proven useful in
              other domains. These learning techniques  will generate computer models that
              can be used to accomplish  the following tasks: (1) suggesting general clinical
               policies that seem cost-effective and underutilized, (2)  providing individual
              physicians with patient-specific  suggestions about diagnostic and therapeutic
              actions that  appear to be equally efficacious clinically but cost less  than
              the planned action, (3) suggesting more effective  actions than may be planned,
              and (4) detection of clinical  situations that are unusual and potentially
              costly. The  database to be used in the investigation contains  information
              about patients with community-acquired  pneumonia.  ***
