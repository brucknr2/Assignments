Abstract    :
              9402198  BOYLE      With an increase in the number of laboratories throughout
              the world  making good Cd measurements, it is anticipated that there will be  a
              rapid expansion of available global Cd database in which to  evaluate the role
              of chemical changes in the changing atmospheric  CO2 and the influence of ocean
              circulation on global climate  change.  This research project will concentrate
              on some particular  issues within this global scale context.  Specially, it
              will (1)  Establish how rapidly deep ocean chemical composition can change by 
              studying foraminiferal trace elements in high deposition rate  cores, single
              individuals (to search for "modes" of deepwater  chemistry, and most
              importantly, deep sea corals) which should  allow for a very high resolution
              view of deepwater chemistry; (2)  Examine the origins of differences between
              13C, Cd and Ba  paleochemical signals from detailed studies of Northwest
              Pacific  cores and through simple ocean geochemical models; (3) Continue to 
              generate long high resolution paleochemical records from key basins  of the
              world oceans in order to explore the spectral links between  deep ocean
              chemistry, atmospheric PCO2, and global climate; and (4)  Continue testing of
              forminiferal accuracy as paleochemical reorders  by studying core tops from
              diverse environments, individual benthic  specimens from high sedimentation
              rate cores, and comparing  different calcitic and aragonitic benthic species
              and deep sea  corals.
