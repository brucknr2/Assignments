Abstract    :
              9402346  Swift    Hydrographic and Chlorofluorocarbon measurements will be taken
               along a meridional section of the South Atlantic Ocean, with  additional
              sections along the equator and 10 degrees South to  determine the role played
              by the deep basin circulation of  Antarctic Bottom Water on climate change on
              decadal time scales.   This work is part of the Deep Basin Experiment, a
              component of the  World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
