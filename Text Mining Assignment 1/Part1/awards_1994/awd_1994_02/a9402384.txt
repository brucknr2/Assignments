Abstract    :
              9402384  MARCUS       This award supports the Engineering Research Center at the
               University of Maryland and the Harvard University to focus on the  integration
              and control of complex engineering system for the next  five years.  The Center
              will use and expand its well-established  industrial collaboration programs to
              facilitate the rapid transfer  of developed system methodologies.          This
              will be achieved through  three cross-disciplinary thrust  areas:  1)
              intelligent control systems which involves the design of  robust control
              systems with many sensors and many feedback loops  using algorithm and tools
              for optimization-based design, 2)  intelligent signal processing and
              communication system which  involves the modelling, design, and control of
              wireless and high-  speed communication networks, 3) system integration
              methodology  which involves model complexity, architectures for control, and 
              communication systems.         In addition, there are three  demonstration
              projects:    (1) electromechanical motion control prototyping project  which 
              will develop basic research and engineering innovation needed to  build
              high-performance, low-cost, motion control system, (2) wire-  less multimedia
              shop communication project which will develop the  research and technology for
              designing multimedia communication  subsystems for manufacturing, (3) virtual
              factories for electro-  mechanical devices manufacturing project which will
              develop an  integrated tool kit for design, planning, and manufacturing of 
              electromechanical devices.        This award provides support for the ERC for
              three years.  ***
