Abstract    :
                  9402563  Darwin  The research represents the continuation of the first major
               revaluation of reinforcing bar geometry in the United States in  over forty
              years.  The study capitalizes on current research  efforts to develop new
              deformation patterns that optimize bar  development characteristics.  Tests are
              used to evaluate the  improvement in bond provided by the new bars, both with
              and without  epoxy coating, as a function of confining reinforcement, cover,
              and  bar spacing.  The bond characteristics of the new bars also  evaluated
              under cyclic loading. Fracture mechanics concepts and  load and resistance
              factor design techniques are used to develop  rational, rather than empirical,
              design procedures.  The research  is carried out in conjunction with
              reinforcing bar producers,  fabricators, coating applicators, and epoxy powder
              manufacturers.   Emphasis is placed on improved bar deformation patterns that
              are  cost effective and practical.
