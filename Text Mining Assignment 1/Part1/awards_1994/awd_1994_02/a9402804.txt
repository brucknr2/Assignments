Abstract    :
              9402804  Curry       Funds are provided that would allow the Pis to continue 
              their study of reconstructing the thermocline at Little  Bahamas bank for
              another year.  Two new cores will be added  to the bathymetric transect at
              Bahamas, and the sampling  frequency for the deglacial interval in high sed
              rate cores  will be increased. The additional year will also allow the  Pis to
              extend the partially completed South Atlantic record.  ***
