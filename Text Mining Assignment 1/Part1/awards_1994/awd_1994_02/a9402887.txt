Abstract    :
              This energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer capable of detecting light elements 
              and a computer work station with software capable of performing quantitative 
              thin film chemical analysis will enable faculty and graduate students to 
              perform quantitative thin film microchemical analysis at the University of 
              Missouri-Rolla. This spectrometer is to be installed on an existing 
              transmission electron microscope. Ancillary equipment that includes a TV 
              camera, cold stage, hot stage and scanning transmission device are also 
              requested. Current research is being performed on synthesis of: 1) novel 
              electrodeposited shape memory alloys that cannot be produced by the standard 
              thermal process, 2) ceramic superlattices that have unique electrical and 
              optical properties, and 3) new rare earth magnetic materials that are 
              technologically important.  %%%  An energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer
              capable of detecting light elements and  a computer work station with software
              capable of performing quantitative thin  film chemical analysis is requested.
              This spectrometer is to be installed on an  existing transmission electron
              microscope. Current research is being performed  on electrodeposited shape
              memory alloys and ceramic superlattices, and new rare  earth magnetic
              materials.  Materials processing is a central theme in each of  these projects
              and an analytically equipped transmission electron microscope is  essential for
              the characterization of these new and exciting materials.
