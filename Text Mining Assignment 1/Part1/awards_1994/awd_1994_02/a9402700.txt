Abstract    :
              9402700  Fournier  This proposal is on research to develop a technique which 
              maintains a pH gradient across a membrane in order to obtain two  pH values in
              the same reactor.  With this approach, two  enzymatically catalyzed reactions
              can occur at their own optimal  pH by immobilizing one enzyme on one side of
              the membrane while  the other enzyme reacts in the bulk phase on the other side
              of  the membrane.  ***
