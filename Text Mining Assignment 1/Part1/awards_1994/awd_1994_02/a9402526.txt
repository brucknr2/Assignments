Abstract    :
                OCE-9402526  GILLIGAN      This is a collaborative proposal between Savannah
              State College and  Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution to provide minority 
              undergraduates with a summer program that is a transitional  academic
              experience from a supportive HMCU instructional setting to  a marine laboratory
              environment. The students will spend five weeks  at Savannah State where the
              students will participate in research-  related training sessions.  The final
              four weeks will be spent at  Harbor Branch where the students will be
              introduced to up-to-date-  technology and work on a research project. This
              project is seen to  be a "bridge to research" program to interest and involve
              minority  students in marine science at an early state of their college  career
              and guide these students into other NSF supported  undergraduate research
              programs.
