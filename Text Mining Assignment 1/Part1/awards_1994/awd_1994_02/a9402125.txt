Abstract    :
              This is a joint project between Colorado State University and the  University of
              Nevada to develop a solid state continuous (cw) wave  laser for an existing
              sodium resonance lidar.  An essential element  of the existing lidar is a
              stable, tunable, narrowband, cw laser  beam that seeds the high power pulsed
              dye amplifier.  The present  unit uses an argon laser tube that is very large
              and expensive to  replace.  The solid state system uses two commercially
              available cw  YAG lasers, one operating at 1.06 micrometers and the other at
              1.32  micrometers which are combined to produce light at 589 nm, a  resonantly
              scattered emission line of atomic sodium.  This  modification will reduce the
              size and complexity of the lidar to  reduce operating costs and make it more
              easily moved to different  locations.  The investigators also propose to
              develop a twin-peak  acoustooptic modulator for more rapid locking to specific
              Doppler-  free features in the sodium spectrum.  This will enable  measurements
              of middle atmospheric properties with much higher time  resolution than the
              present system.  The University of Nevada will  be in charge of the research
              and development of the cw sum-  frequency generation of 589 nm radiation. 
              Colorado State  University will be responsible for development of the twin-peak
               acousto-optic modulator.
