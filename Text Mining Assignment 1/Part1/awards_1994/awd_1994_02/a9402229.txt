Abstract    :
              9402229  Spong  In this research project, fundamental issues related to the 
              design, analysis, and real-time implementation of robust and  adaptive control
              laws for underactuated mechanical systems  are investigated. The class of
              systems is quite  broad and  encompasses balancing and walking robots, a
              variety of  flexible structures including flexible link and flexible  joint
              robots, as well as robot models that include actuator  dynamics, and many of
              the classical control problems such as  ball and beam, and cart-pole systems.
              The integrating theme  of the research effort is the utilization of the
              integrator  backstepping method for the design of underactuated systems. 
              Currently, powerful design techniques, such as feedback  linearization,
              singular perturbations, and passivity based  methods, are available for fully
              actuated systems. These  techniques are extended for their applicability to 
              underactuated systems.  ***
