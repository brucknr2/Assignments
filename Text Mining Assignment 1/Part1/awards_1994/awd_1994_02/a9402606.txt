Abstract    :
                Proposal No. 94-02606    Rosentiel School for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences
              (RSMAS) at the University of Miami requests renewed funding for shipboard
              technician activities associated with the research vessels ISELIN, a 170-foot
              vessel, and CALANUS, a 64 foot vessel.  Both vessels are owned and operated by
              the University.  In calendar year 1994, the ISELIN will support a total of 77
              days of NSF-funded research, primarily in the north Atlantic.  The CALANUS will
              support a total of 30 days of NSF-funded research, primarily in the coastal
              waters of Florida and the Bahamas.  RSMAS technicians will be responsible for
              operating and repairing instruments while at sea, maintaining instruments
              onshore and assisting with scientific operations necessary before and after
              cruises.
