Abstract    :
              9402640  Pollack  This project is devoted to improving algorithms for the 
              existential theory of the reals, the general decision problem for  real closed
              fields and quantifier elimination over real closed  fields.  The goal is to be
              able to separate the complexity of  these algorithms into a combinatorial part
              (the dependence on the  number of input polynomials) and an algebraic part (the
               dependence on the degrees of these polynomials).  The project  should produce
              algorithms which are combinatorially optimal.  One  step in such algorithms is
              to compute a set of points which meet  every cell determined by a family of
              polynomials.  The project  will extend this task, and will compute a set of
              points on a  variety of real dimension k which meets every cell of a family of 
              polynomials in such a way that the combinatorial complexity  depends optimally
              on k.  ***
