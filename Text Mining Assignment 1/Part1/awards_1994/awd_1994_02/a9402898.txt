Abstract    :
              ***  9402898  Rosen               .  This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase II project will develop and demonstrate an innovative light-weight
              damping treatment for noise isolation and vibration control.  The research will
              focus on an innovative composite stiffness gradient damping concept which has
              the potential for a significant performance improvement over conventional
              constrained layer damping treatments.  Major sources of noise contamination in
              industrial environments include rotating high speed machinery, motors, engines
              and gearboxes with vibrations in the 100Hz. to 10 Khz. frequency range.  This
              high-level noise is a contributory factor in operator fatigue and discomfort. 
              The research is designed to fully define the interactions between controlled
              constraining layer property variations and the damping performance of the
              structure.  This understanding will be used to optimize the damping performance
              against structural requirements and manufacturing considerations for
              application in the high noise environment of a gas turbine engine gearbox
              mount. On completion of these optimization studies, a demonstration article
              will be manufactured and tested to validate the damping performance and
              demonstrate structural reliability under typical operation.  ***
