Abstract    :
              9402021  Palmer         Knowledge of spatial and frequency domain
              interferometric  (SI/FDI) techniques has progressed to a point where real
              scientific  gains are being obtained.  Using these relatively new techniques 
              has provided the scientist with additional observations to  investigate the
              atmosphere.  The first phase of the project is the  study of the planetary
              boundary layer (PBL) using a recently  acquired 915 MHz radar at the University
              of Nebraska-Lincoln.  We   propose to modify the radar so that FDI can be
              performed.  The main  goal is to study the effect on gravity wave propagation
              of low-  level jets, which exist in the Great Plains region.  The proposed 
              research also extends into the tropo/stratospheric regions, where  the PIs are
              interested in refining the observational methods.   Although the idea of
              "corrected" vertical velocities at VHF wave-  lengths was introduced in 1985,
              recent measurements at multiple  wavelengths has cast doubt on this idea.  The
              PIs intend to  investigate the problem using the MU radar facility in Japan,
              where  there is a VHF interferometric system along with a UHF boundary  layer
              radar.  The effect of the jet stream on refractivity layer  tilting will also
              be investigated using SI techniques.  Isentropic  surface are known to reverse
              in tilt above and below a jet stream  peak.  Japan has an extremely strong jet
              in the winter and it is  proposed to make measurements directly related to
              studying the jet  stream.  Using the Sondre Stromfjord radar in Greenland, the
              MU  radar in Japan, and the modified 915 MHz radar in Nebraska, the  dependence
              of FDI techniques on wavelength will be investigated.   The FDI techniques can
              provide an estimate of the vertical extend  of turbulent layers, which may have
              a dependence on radar  wavelength.  Observations using these three wavelengths
              should  elucidate this problem.
