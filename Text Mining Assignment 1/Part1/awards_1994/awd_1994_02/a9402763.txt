Abstract    :
              9404376  Kohn        Coherent  phase  transformations lead  to  mixtures  of 
              different phases or phase variants with characteristic fine scale  structures.
              The modelling of these microstructures is crucial for  understanding
              macroscopic phenomena such as shape-memory  behavior and hysteresis, as well as
              microscopic phenomena such as  the  morphology of twinning. In some situations
              the observed fine  scale structures and macroscopic effects can be explained on
               the  basis of elastic energy minimization. Mathematically, the essence  of 
              the  matter is the minimization of nonconvex elastic energies  with "multi-well
              structure. This project brings to bear a variety  of  tools,  many of them
              relatively new, including relaxation  of  variational  problems,  the 
              translation  method,  Young  measure  limits, H-measures, and singular
              perturbations. Energy minimizing  microstructures  can  be  viewed  as 
              composite  materials   with  extremal  effective behavior, so methods from
              homogenization  and  the analysis of composite materials are also relevant.    
                 The  goals  of  this project include  developing  new  mathematical  tools,
              and also applying these  tools  to  specific  problems  from materials science.
              One objective is to  understand  why some shape-memory alloys maintain their
              shape-memory behavior  in  polycrystalline  form while others  do  not. 
              Another  is  to  explain   experimental  observations  concerning   twinning  
              and  hysteresis in single crystals of CuAlNi.
