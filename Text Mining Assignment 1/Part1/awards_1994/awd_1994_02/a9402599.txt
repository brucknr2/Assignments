Abstract    :
              9402599  Gidley  An interdisciplinary research program will be undertaken that
              combines the well known defect sensitivity of positron techniques with
              state-of-the-art positron beam technology in order to detect and image the
              early stages of microstructural damage in a wide range of engineering materials
              where traditional techniques are not adequate.  The inability to characterize
              defect evolution on the nanometer size scale represents a major missing link in
              the fundamental knowledge of the synthesis-to-failure life cycle of many
              engineering materials.  If materials scientist can measure the microstructural
              evolution of damage from synthesis to failure they will be greatly facilitated
              in improving such material properties as strength and durability, wear and
              corrosion resistance, environmental compatibility, and fabrication cost
              effectiveness.  ***
