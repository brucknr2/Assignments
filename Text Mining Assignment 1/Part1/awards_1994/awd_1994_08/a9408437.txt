Abstract    :
              9408437  Bernholc  A comprehensive theoretical investigation will be done of the
               electronic properties and growth of wide band gap semiconductors.   The
              studies of growth of diamond will concentrate on mechanisms and  focus mainly
              on atomic layer epitaxy processes and step-flow  growth.  The studies of
              aluminum nitride and gallium nitride will  focus on native defects,
              stoichiometry effects, and doping and  impurity incorporation.  For aluminum
              nitride, conditions leading  to negative electron affinity will be identified. 
              There will be  extensive interactions with experimentalists.  Quantum molecular
               dynamics will be used, supplemented with semi-empirical methods.   Codes will
              be run primarily on massively parallel computers and  algorithms will be
              developed as required.  %%%  This theoretical research will focus on an
              important class of  semiconducting materials.  Advanced computational methods
              will be  utilized in these investigations including massively parallel 
              computers.  Of particular interest is the emphasis on growth  processes for
              these materials.  ***
