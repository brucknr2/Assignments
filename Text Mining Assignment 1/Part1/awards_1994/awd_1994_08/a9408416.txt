Abstract    :
              Abstract    9408416  Bein    This research program focuses on the design of
              novel nanoporous  thin films with molecular recognition capabilities for stable
               chemical sensors. Novel oriented zeolite films will be combined  with optical
              sensors based on fluorescence dyes stabilized in the  zeolite matrix.
              Collisional fluorescence quenching with oxygen and  halogenated hydrocarbons
              will demonstrate the concept of optical  sensors with molecular sieving
              capabilities.  In addition, a number  of novel size-selective mass sensors will
              be developed: (i) sensors  with preferred sorption of non-polar organic vs.
              polar compounds,  and (ii) selective sensors for aliphatic and aromatic amines.
              The  exploration of synthetic routes for novel thin films on sensors  will also
              address fascinating aspects of multifunctional molecular  films, and nucleation
              and growth of nanoporous structures. This  work is important because there is
              an urgent need for new families  of selective sensors with long-term stability.
               %%%  Rapidly growing demands for comprehensive monitoring in the 
              environmental, medical and industrial field have stimulated efforts  to develop
              high performance chemical sensors. While many sensors  show excellent
              sensitivity, their molecular selectivity and  long-term stability remain
              important challenges. This research  program focuses on the design of novel
              nanoporous thin films with  molecular recognition capabilities for stable
              chemical sensors.  Novel oriented zeolite films will be combined with optical
              sensors  based on fluorescence dyes stabilized in the zeolite matrix. In 
              addition, a number of novel size-selective mass sensors will be  developed.
