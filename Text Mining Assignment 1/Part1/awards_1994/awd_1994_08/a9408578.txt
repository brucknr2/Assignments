Abstract    :
              9408578  Gustafsson    The structure of clean and adsorbate covered surfaces
              using medium  energy ion scattering (MEIS) and scanning tunneling microscopic 
              (STM) will be determined.  The surface vibrational amplitudes of  well ordered
              metal surfaces of silver and copper will be measured  in the anharmonic regime
              and correlated with structural changes.   Further studies will focus on systems
              that undergo displacive  surface phase transitions and metal overlayers on
              oxides.  An  atomistic understanding of these effects can have a beneficial 
              impact on a large number of areas of applied nature, such as  magnetic films,
              chemically passive coating, tribology, and  bimetallic catalysts.    %  %  %  %
                   The goal of these studies is to determine the geometric and  vibrational
              structure of clean and adsorbate covered surfaces.  Our  main experimental
              technique is medium energy ion scattering, a very  powerful, but not widely
              available, quantitative method for the  determination of surface structure. 
              The specific systems to be  studied include low index surfaces of silver and
              copper, as well as  metal overlayers on oxide surfaces.  The experiments will 
              contribute towards an understanding of emerging technologies, like  bimetallic
              catalysts, optical and magnetic films, chemically  passive coatings and
              tribology.  ***
