Abstract    :
              9408220  Rapaport  Nuclear structure and reaction mechanisms studies will be
              carried  out at IUCF, LAMPF, and at the Ohio University tandem van de  Graaff
              accelerator.  The principal activity will be proton-  neutron charge-exchange
              reaction studies, the objective of which  is to understand the behavior of the
              nucleon-nucleon tensor  interaction in the nuclear medium.  The energy
              dependence of the  interaction may provide insight into an important issue
              relating  to nuclear density dependence of the nucleon and rho-meson  masses.
