Abstract    :
              Theoretical research in proposed in the field of  intermediate and low-energy
              nuclear physics.  The projects  share, in the main, the methods and models of
              the few-body  problem, attention to the successful phenomenology of the  strong
              interaction at the hadronic and at the quark level,  and use of the
              electromagnetic interaction as a probe of  properties of systems bound by the
              strong interaction.  These projects include three-nucleon forces, nuclear
              charge  asymmetry in nuclear and hypernuclear systems, and three-  body models
              of light nuclei and hypernuclei.
