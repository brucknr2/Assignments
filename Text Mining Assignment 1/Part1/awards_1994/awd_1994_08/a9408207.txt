Abstract    :
              Antonovics  9408207   The ecological and evolutionary impact of sexually
              transmitted diseases (STD's) has rarely been studied in a non-medical context;
              they have been considered a minor type of infectious disease in natural
              systems.  The investigators' initial studies have shown that STD's are abundant
              within the animal kingdom and that they have many shared characteristics (low
              disease induced mortality, long span of infectious period, narrow host ranges,
              sterility, less population cycling).   This study will use theoretical models
              to investigate (a) the factors that influence evolution towards sexual  versus
              other modes of disease transmission, (b) the coevolution of pathogen
              characteristics and host mating systems, and (c) the effect of spatial
              structure on stability and evolution of STD's   STD's can have important
              consequences for population regulation and for the evolution of mating systems.
               The study of their population biology is also relevant for interpreting and
              predicting the emergence of new diseases.  The present study will bear directly
              on these issues.
