Abstract    :
              9408634  This work is the continuing research on non-equilibrium phase 
              transitions and their applications to catalysis using a variety of  modern
              tools in statistical mechanics.  The motivation is to study  the universality
              classes by studying the effect of correlations and  fluctuations.  The work is
              of some relevance in commercially  important chemical reactions and biochemical
              processes.  %%%  Catalysis plays an important role in many commercial chemical 
              reactions and in biochemical processes.  The main objective of  the proposed
              research is to understand the universal features  at the onset of instabilities
              using modern techniques of  statistical mechanics.  This work is expected to
              provide better  understanding of controlling the efficiency of the catalysis 
              process.
