Abstract    :
              9408667  Bonacina  This is a project on contraction-based distributed strategies
              for  automated deduction.  Since inference systems are non-  deterministic,
              i.e. they do not specify an order of execution of  the inferences, the computer
              applications of deduction, e.g.  logic programming and automated theorem
              proving, have been  regarded by many as natural candidates for parallel
              execution.  A  large amount of research has been done in the parallelization of
               logic programming, functional programming (which can be viewed as  a form of
              equational deduction) and subgoal-reduction theorem  proving strategies, e.g.
              Prolog technology theorem proving.  Most  of these works adopted fine-grain
              parallelism in shared memory.    The concern of this project is different,
              because it focuses on a  different class of strategies, contraction-based
              theorem proving  strategies, and on a different type of parallelism,
              coarse-grain  parallelism in distributed memory.  The distinguishing feature of
               these strategies is the use of high-priority contraction  inference rules to
              delete generated clauses.    This project considers four problems: partition of
              the search  space among concurrent processes, contraction with respect to a 
              distributed data base, duplication of clauses in a distributed  data base and
              unstability of distributed derivations.  It will  study ways to address these
              problems, to be designed in detail  and implemented in new distributed
              strategies.  The project also  comprises a theoretical part, which aims at
              initiating the  mathematical representation and analysis of search in theorem 
              proving.  ***
