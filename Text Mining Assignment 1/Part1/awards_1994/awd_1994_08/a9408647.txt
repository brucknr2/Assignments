Abstract    :
              9408647  Spilhaus  This award will support the travel of approximately ten U.S. 
              scientists to the NATO Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on the  Physics of
              Ice-Covered Seas, June 6-17, 1994, in Finland.    Ice-covered seas in the
              antarctic and the arctic are thought to be  important components in global
              climatic change, since the presence  or absence of sea ice has an enormous
              effect on the surface albedo,  surface temperature, water vapor flux, and low
              cloud amount.  It is  possible that a positive feedback loop exists in that the
              reduction  of sea ice produces a lowered albedo, which leads to further 
              surface warming.  The formation of sea ice moreover has profound  oceanic
              effects by destabilizing the surface layers and promoting  deep vertical
              convection in regions that are normally only  marginally stable.   
              Scientifically the ASI is sponsored by the IUGG International  Association of
              the Physical Sciences of the Ocean, and the IUGG  Scientific Committee on
              Oceanic Research.  ***
