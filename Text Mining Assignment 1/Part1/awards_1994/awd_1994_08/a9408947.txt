Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9408947  Chan    A request has been made for funding to help
              offset organizational costs of an International Symposium aimed at bringing
              together active researchers from the transport phenomena and combustion
              communities in order to exchange the state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in
              both fields and to delineate the joint work towards the optimal design of low
              emission, high efficiency energy systems.  Participation especially from the
              Pacific Rim countries will be strongly encouraged.  There is a definite need to
              provide an appropriate forum which can bring together both communities and this
              International Symposium on Transport Phenomena in Combustion represents a good
              start.  The symposium will be held in San Francisco, CA on July 16-20, 1995. 
              Attendance is expected to be comprised of approximately 40% from the U. S., 40%
              from the Pacific Rim countries and 20% from the rest of the world.
