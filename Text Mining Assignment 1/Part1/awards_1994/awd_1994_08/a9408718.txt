Abstract    :
              9408718  Abstract  This project is a continued exploration of the use of
              Drosophila in  genetic approaches to the nervous system.  The analysis is
              applied  to problems in development, including the assembly of the eyes and  in
              the formation of their connections to the brain.  Special  attention is paid to
              the role of glial cells in these processes,  and in their interaction with
              neurons in maintenance of the  integrity of the brain.  Genetic analysis is
              applied to the  mechanism of transmitter release at synapses, characterization
              of  the proteins involved, and the effects on behavior of mutations  that alter
              synaptic proteins.  In addition, new molecular genetic  techniques are
              described for isolating mutations in selected genes  that are expressed in
              specific parts of the nervous system, and for  generating monoclonal antibodies
              and associated cDNAs for the  corresponding gene products.  %%%  Given the
              numerous molecular homologies between the fly and other  organisms, including
              mammals, Drosophila serves as a model system  for understanding basic
              mechanisms in the relation of genes to  behavior.  ***
