Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
              Department  of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina with the purchase
              of a nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This new instrumentation
              will enhance greatly research in a  number of areas including the following: 
              (1)  "Motional Studies in Halomethanes and Other  Molecular Species by NMR",
              and (2)  "Isolation and Structure Elucidation of Bioactive  Marine Natural
              Products".    A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to obtain
              information about molecular  structure (what types of carbon and/or hydrogen
              atoms are present, what are the relative number  of each type of atoms and how
              are they connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular  dynamics (how
              rapidly are the various parts of the molecule moving).  This instrument is 
              essential for any meaningful, modern synthetic chemistry research program.
