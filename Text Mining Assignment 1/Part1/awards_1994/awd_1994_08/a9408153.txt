Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9408153  C. Sorenson    Static and dynamic light scattering
              techniques will be developed to study properties of the fractal aerosol
              clusters, including morphology, diffusional transport, optical scattering
              properties and aggregation kinetics.  Aggregates of particles formed through
              coagulation processes are described as fractals, which allows for improved
              measuring techniques and overall physical understanding.  The experiments will
              be performed with carbonaceous soot aerosols in premixed flames, and silica and
              titania aerosols.    The proposed measuring techniques have scientific
              relevance, and may be applied to studies related to aerosols and colloids in
              industrial processes, environmental aerosol analysis, combustion, and nuclear
              reactor safety.  ***
