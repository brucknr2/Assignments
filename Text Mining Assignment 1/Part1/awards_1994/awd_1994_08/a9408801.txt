Abstract    :
              In this project in the physical chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. R. J. Gordon of the University of Illinois at Chicago   will pursue a
              variety of investigations in molecular dynamics, in the   general area of
              non-adiabatic reactions.  Two types of experiments will   be performed:
              photodissociation and bi-molecular reactions.  Among the   first type are
              studies of avoided crossings in ozone, multiple pathways   in the
              photodissociation of chloroethylenes, and the photodissociation of   hydrogen
              chloride.  Included in the second type are investigations of the   collision of
              B-state excited carbon monoxide with argon, and the reaction   dynamics of
              atomic deuterium with hydrogen chloride and of atomic   chlorine with hydrogen
              bromide.    The subject of non-adiabatic electronic transitions in reactive
              chemistry   is an important one and a number of test systems are investigated
              in this   project.  Besides being of fundamental interest, the
              photodissociation    studies also have bearing on environmetal issues.
