Abstract    :
              9408145  Durand    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Stephen Durand
              will  collect pilot data to assess the feasibility of a technique to  determine
              the geographical source for timbers used to construct  the Great Houses in
              Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. Chaco Canyon is a  major archaeological site which
              was occupied between 900-1150 AD.  The amount of labor involved in the
              construction of large  "apartment houses" and ceremonial kiva lodges indicates
              a high  degree of political organization and the integration of large  numbers
              of individuals within a single social system.  Archaeologists wish to
              understand what led to the emergence of  the Chacoan system and have attempted
              to determine the geographic  extent of its sphere of influence. Dr. Durand's
              project will  provide important information which will assist in this process. 
              His very preliminary data indicate that the wood used to build  the great
              Chacoan structures bears the chemical imprint of the  specific region in which
              an individual tree grew and that  variations in chemical composition reflect
              the substrate of the  particular region. Therefore, through analysis of the
              trees, it  should be possible to determine points of origin. In this first 
              stage of the project, he will collect pilot data to determine how  well the
              chemical fingerprinting system works.    This research is important for several
              reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many regional archaeologists. It
              will shed  new light on the development of cultural complexity in the 
              Southwestern United States and help in the development of a tool  of
              potentially broad scientific utility.
