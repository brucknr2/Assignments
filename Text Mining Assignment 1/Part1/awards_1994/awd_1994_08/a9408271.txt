Abstract    :
                       This is the first year funding of a two-year award.   The  objective of
              the proposed research is to better understand the  effects of using external
              telecommunications and data networks on  firm performance and the nature of
              relations among trading  partners.  The research will contribute to the base of
              knowledge in  this area by studying external network usage across firms and 
              across industries, using both qualitative case studies and  quantitative survey
              methodologies.  In particular, the research  will empirically test a model that
              proposes that the effects of  external network usage on firm performance and
              buyer-seller  relationships are dependent upon the attributes of the networks 
              used, firms, products, and the business context. The research will  focus on
              the openness of the telecommunications networks and on the  degree to which
              they carry computerized data.  These contingent  influences of network usage
              will in turn have their effects on  performance and buyer-seller structures
              through a number of  mediating factors, which the research will explicitly
              measure.  Mediating factors include the various type of costs firms  incur in
              the process of making transactions with trading  partners, the nature of the
              interpersonal relations that  exist between buyers and sellers, and the types
              of services  and products that are exchanged.
