Abstract    :
              9408443  Scully  Description:  This proposal supports the travel of a delegation
               of U.S. physicists to Pakistan to participate in the 19th  International
              Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and  Contemporary Needs/International
              Workshop on Laser and Quantum  Optics, to be held at Nathiagali, Pakistan, June
              23-July 14,  1994.  The meeting is an annual activity organized by the 
              Pakistan Ministry of Science and Technology and arose out of a  vital need for
              communication among scientists.  It offers  participants a forum to discuss
              advances in physics and their  relationship to modern needs, particularly
              issues and concerns of  developing countries.  The first two weeks will cover
              the general  aspects of Particle Transport, and Laser Physics and 
              Applications.  The last week will be devoted to an International  Workshop on
              Lasers and Quantum Optics.           Scope:  The proposed summer college has
              been held annually in  Nathiagali, Pakistan with participation from scientists 
              throughout Asia and Africa and with lecturers from the western  world.  Each
              year, a number of women scientists are also invited  both as lecturers and
              participants.  It has received strong  endorsement in the past from
              participants from these countries as  well as from international organizations
              including the Inter-  national Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste.  It
              received  partial support from that center as well as from the Chinese  Academy
              of Sciences in Beijing.   ***
