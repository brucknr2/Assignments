Abstract    :
              9408794  Nadelhoffer  The goal of this project is to test and improve computer
              models of forest nutrient cycles by incorporating information from on-going
              studies in Maine and Massachusetts forests using a naturally occurring,
              non-radioactive isotope of nitrogen (15N) as a tracer.  These 15N tracer
              studies are unique in that they employ tracers at large scales--either on large
              plots with intact, mature trees, or in entire forested watersheds (10
              hectares).  Our use of 15N tracers at ecosystem scales has allowed us to
              measure the importance's of different vegetation (e.g. leaves, wood, tree
              species) and soil (mineral soil, forest floor, litter) pools as "sink" for
              anthropogenic N inputs to forest.  As a result of these experiments, the
              distributions of 15N in our forest plots and experimental catchment now differ
              markedly from 15N distributions in natural forest.  As nitrogen continues to
              cycle within these forests, the 15N tracers will continue to be redistributed
              even though no additional 15N will be added.  This poses a unique opportunity
              to test and refine simulation models of forest ecosystems that are being used
              to predict responses of forests to a changing climate and chronic atmospheric N
              deposition that is now occurring downwind of industrialized regions of the
              northern hemisphere.  Improving these models using information derived from our
              large-scale tracer studies will lead to a better understanding of the
              interactions between nutrient cycles, forest growth and ecosystem drainage
              water quality and to better predictions of forest ecosystem responses to
              changes in climate and air quality.
