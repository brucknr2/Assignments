Abstract    :
              9408318  Jayawickrama  The objective of this research is to apply the concept of
               System Identification Method (SID) to optimize the use of  existing monitoring
              well data and to improve the reliability  of the site information used in the
              characterization of  hazardous waste sites. The SID method which has been 
              successfully employed in many other branches of engineering  has never been
              used in geotechnical and geo-environmental  engineering applications. The
              method involves the study of  the characteristics of an unknown system by
              observing how  the system responds to a known stimulus or input.In the 
              proposed research, the unknown system will be the  contaminated site. Data
              describing the actual system  behavior will be in the form of existing
              monitoring well  data on contaminant propagation within the site.  ***
