Abstract    :
                                9408052  Green  This research will investigate the regulation
              and function of the  RNA-degrading enzymes (RNases) of the model plant
              Arabidopsis  thaliana.  Our initial work has led to the biochemical 
              characterization of the Arabidopsis RNase profile and the cloning  of three
              RNase genes.  To augment these approaches, several mutants  of Arabidopsis with
              altered RNase patterns have been isolated.   Based on these studies, the
              objectives of the present project are  as follows: 1) Generate and utilize
              antibodies to study the  location and regulation of Arabidopsis RNases; 2)
              Characterize the  RNase mutants by analyzing the progeny of various genetic
              crosses;  3) Examine the function of Arabidopsis RNases via mutant analysis 
              and antisense approaches.  Emphasis will be placed on the  identification of
              RNases that contribute to mRNA stability and/or  phosphate remobilization. 
              This research should provide important  insight into the roles of RNases in
              fundamental processes that may  be unique to plants or of broad significance. 
              Beyond its  contribution to basic knowledge, this work could identify RNases 
              whose manipulation might lead to crop improvement.  ***
