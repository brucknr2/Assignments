Abstract    :
              Partial funding are provided for acquisition of an Ion Beam  Analytical
              Facility. This unique facility will be sited at  Case Western Reserve
              University and will be part of the Ohio  MatNet consortium of universities.
              Work stations connected  to the facility over Internet will be located at
              Bowling  Green State University, the University of Cincinnati, and  Ohio State
              University. The instrument will initially service  about twenty faculty at the
              four universities. Ultimately,  it will provide a user-oriented facility for
              materials  researchers at the 14 Ohio universities, at the two Federal 
              laboratories in Ohio (NASA Lewis Research Center and Wright  Patterson Air
              Force Base), and to industrial researchers.  Access will initially be focussed
              on, but not restricted to,  users in Ohio. The Facility also is anticipated to
              serve as  a major resource for materials research throughout the  Midwest
              region. The instrument will be primarily used for  Rutherford Backscattering
              Spectroscopy, Nuclear Reaction  Analysis, and Particle-Induced X-ray Emission
              Spectroscopy;  channeling, elastic recoil detection, and resonance  scattering
              analysis, will also be available. Applications  include a variety of thin film
              analyses and quantitative  analysis of hydrogen and other light elements, and
              analysis  of low levels of metallic impurities in metals,  semiconductors, and
              device structures.
