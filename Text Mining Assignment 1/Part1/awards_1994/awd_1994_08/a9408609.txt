Abstract    :
                   This three-year program is a continuation of the Millstone  Hill
              Observatory in Westford, Massachusetts.  This incoherent  scatter radar
              facility supports both optical and radar operations,  encompassing a broad
              range of topics involving processes and  dynamics of the thermosphere,
              ionosphere and magnetosphere, as well  as investigations of plasma waves and
              magnetic storm effects.  Data  will be deposited in the CEDAR data base at NCAR
              for community use.
