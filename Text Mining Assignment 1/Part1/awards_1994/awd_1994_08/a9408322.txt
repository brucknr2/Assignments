Abstract    :
              9408322  Godschalk  This study will analyze the hazard mitigation efforts
              carried out  under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
              since its passage in 1988 for three major types of recurrent  natural
              disasters:  earthquakes, hurricanes and coastal storms,  and floods.    To
              provide a systematic understanding of the practice and  potential of
              mitigation, the study will carry out several tasks.  It will assess the content
              of the mitigation plans required by  the act, the mitigation grant program
              expenditures, and the  outcomes of implementing these plans and programs.  It
              will also  describe and analyze the planning and decision making processes 
              that created the mitigation plans for a selected set of  disasters.  ***
