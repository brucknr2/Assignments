Abstract    :
              9408866  Haan       The project involves investigations into 1) photoionization 
              and photorecombination processes in atomic systems, 2) strong  field
              interactions using model potentials and 3) numerical  calculations of
              photoionization of two electron systems.  Density  matrix formulations will
              enable open systems to be investigated  where these processes might interfere
              and the use of a time  dependent evolution of the wavefunction enables a clear 
              visualization of the breakup process in strong fields.  ***
