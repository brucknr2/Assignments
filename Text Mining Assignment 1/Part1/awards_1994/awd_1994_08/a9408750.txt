Abstract    :
                Users of mobile computers, such as palmtops, notebook computers and  personal
              communications systems, will soon have online access to a  large number of
              databases via wireless networks.  The potential  market for this activity is
              estimated to be billion of dollars  annually, in access and communication
              charge.  For example, while  on the road, passengers will access airline and
              other carriers  schedules, and weather information.  Investors will access
              prices  of financial instruments, salespeople will access inventory data, 
              callers will access traffic information, and wearable ubiquitous  computers
              will access a wide variety of databases.    Wireless communication is more
              expensive and less reliable that  wire communication.  We demonstrate that the
              way online data is  allocated/replicated at mobile computers affect both, cost
              and data  availability, and therefore data allocations has to change  according
              to changing conditions, such as access patterns, users'  location, etc.   
              Presently, the allocation scheme of a distributed database is  established in a
              static fashion, when the database is designed.   The allocation scheme remains
              fixed until the designer manually  intervenes to change the number of replicas
              or their location.  We  show that this is an unsatisfactory solution,
              particularly in  mobile computing.
