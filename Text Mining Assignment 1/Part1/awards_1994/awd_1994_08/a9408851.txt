Abstract    :
              9408851  Taylor       Research in particle physics will focus on the study of 
              abnormal states of matter that will be formed during high  energy collisions. 
              The specific topic to be studied concern  the formation and subsequent decay of
              metastable states in  these processes.  The occurrence of this phenomenon will 
              give rise to copious production of particles called mesons  with unusual
              distributions in the number of charged  particles.  The project will involve
              active participation in  an experiment to look for such events.  The results of
              the  study will furnish a better picture of how particles  interact.  ***
