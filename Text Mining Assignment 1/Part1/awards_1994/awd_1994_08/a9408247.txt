Abstract    :
              9408247  Kishi  The focus of this research will involve seven parts.  The total 
              synthesis and investigation of conformational changes of  palytoxin, the
              conformational analysis of C- and O-glycosides,  the conformational analysis of
              fatty acids and their  derivatives, the structure elucidation and synthesis of
              AAL  toxins and Fumonisins, the study of Ni(II)/Cr(II) mediated  coupling
              reactions, the development of tripodal ligand  chemistry and studies involving
              bioluminescence chemistry will  all be carried out.  %%%  With this renewal
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports  the research of Dr. Yoshito
              Kishi of the Department of  Chemistry at Harvard University.  Professor Kishi
              will focus  his work on synthetic and conformational studies of complex 
              biomolecules.  ***
