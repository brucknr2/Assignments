Abstract    :
              9408455  Hoffmann  Cornell University  In this research, supported by the NSF
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program, extended Huckel theory is
              applied to treat: (1) transition metal carbides, borides, and silicides, (2)
              activation of CH and HH bonds by Rhodium porphyrin complexes, (3) tetrahedral
              and  square-planar networks of main group and transition metal elements, (4)
              enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of methane to methanol, and (5) novel, super-hard
              materials consisting of interpenetrating diamond-like nets.   Some speculative
              new bonding concepts based on generalized orbital populations will be explored.
                 Huckel theory has its origin in the fundamentally correct laws of molecular
              quantum mechanics, but drastic approximations are made to simplify the
              computations so that it becomes feasible to apply these methods to molecular
              systems much too large to be treated by the more rigorous ab initio theories. 
              When judiciously applied, extended Huckel theory has proved to provide reliable
              predictions of chemical structures and insight into the principles of chemical
              bonding.  In this research project Huckel theory is applied to a broad range of
              chemical problems directed toward the discovery of new  materials with unusual
              physical and chemical properties and a deeper understanding of the chemical
              principles which govern these properties.
