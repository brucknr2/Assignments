Abstract    :
              The recent mollusk collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
              (ANSP) is the oldest mollusk collection in the country, and the second largest
              catalogued one in the world.  It currently has more than 430,000 catalogued
              lots containing about 12 million specimens, including 30,000-35,000 lots
              preserved in alcohol that provide excellent material for anatomical and genetic
              studies.  The Academy has specimens from virtually all parts of the world; it
              is unrivaled for shallow-water marines mollusks from the tropical Indo-Pacific.
               Other strengths are shallow-water Western Atlantic marine mollusks, and 
              worldwide freshwater and land mollusks.  Many of the land and freshwater
              mollusks are species now  endangered or extinct.  In the past five years,
              almost 300 loans totaling more than 40,00 specimens  have been made, and more
              than 200 scientific articles have acknowledged use of collection resources. 
              This award provides support for computerizing the collection of Western
              Atlantic marine mollusks  includes computerization of the estimated 50,000 lots
              of North American freshwat er mollusks and 45,  000 lots of Western Atlantic
              marine mollusks will help in determining changes in the historical 
              distribution patterns of species.  Little such information is currently
              available, but is needed not  only by scientists conducting basic systematic
              and ecological research on mollusks, but to provide  baseline data for
              monitoring the health of important North American ecosystems in lakes, rivers, 
              estuaries, and along seacoasts.
