Abstract    :
              9408283  Wee        Freshwater, scale-covered algae called "golden algae" are 
              common throughout the world, but their taxonomic classification is  problematic
              and their phylogenetic relationships are poorly known.   Most collections are
              identified as the genus Mallomonas or as  Synura, but considerable variability
              hides within the bounds of  these convenient categories.  Dr. James Wee of
              Loyola University,  with colleagues at Tulane University and elsewhere, is
              addressing  this problem by studying morphological features of the siliceous 
              scales and cellular ultrastructure while adding significant new  data from DNA
              sequencing of nuclear ribosomal genes.  Mutational  differences among species
              in these synurophyte algae will be  assessed and used to construct likely
              phylogenetic trees, which in  turn can be used to evaluate changes in
              morphological features  employed as taxonomic discriminators.       Synurophyte
              species are key environmental indicators in lake  acidification studies, are
              associated with taste and odor causing  compounds in potable water supplies,
              and are used in basic  biological research on cell structure.  Reliable
              taxonomic  identification, stable classification, and robust phylogenetic 
              analysis will improve both their utility and our understanding of  their
              ecology and evolution.
