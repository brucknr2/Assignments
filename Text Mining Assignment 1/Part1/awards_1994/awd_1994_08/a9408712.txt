Abstract    :
              9408712  Coleman    Since 1978, long-term research has been conducted on the
              effects of tillage regimes and the impacts of biotic manipulations on soil
              organic matter (SOM) dynamics and nutrient cycling processes in southeastern
              agroecosystems.  Several studies have provided information on the long-term
              changes which are occurring over time-spans of decades.  This project will
              maintain these long-term experiments.  A comparative approach will continue to
              be used in three core areas: soil structure, food webs, and education.    This
              work will continue to be of importance not only in the context of basic
              ecological relationships, but also as a guide for improvement of agricultural
              practices.  As a project it is an excellent example of the immediate linkage
              between fundamental discovery and application.
