Abstract    :
              9408882  Lairson  Magnetic multilayers will be studied as a new class of media
              materials for perpendicular magnetic recording, particularly with regard to
              their applicability to hard disk storage.  Fundamental structural and magnetic
              properties shall be related to micromagnetic and recording properties in
              layered materials, and crystallographically textured films will be prepared on
              industry-standard substrates which can be tested for recording properties. 
              Well-understood materials, such as epitaxial films and films deposited on
              textured seed layers, shall also be prepared using industry-accepted
              fabrication techniques such as magnetron sputtering.  Work will focus on
              achieving a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental properties of the
              films and the relationship of these properties to magnetic data storage in
              multilayers.    New knowledge resulting from this work will be the
              understanding of magnetic recording issues in the multigigabit per square inch
              recording regime and the role micromagnetic properties of multilayers play in
              issues such as overwrite, signal-to-noise, and data stability.  It is
              anticipated that this knowledge will have a significant positive impact on the
              ultimate applicability of multilayers to hard disk data storage.  ***
