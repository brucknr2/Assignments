Abstract    :
              9408728  Cassidy                                 ABSTRACT         The Dictionary
              of American Regional English, official dictionary of  the American Dialect
              Society, treats both regional and social variation  among speakers of American
              English. Based on an extensive program of  contemporary (1965-70) fieldwork in
              1002 communities across the U.S.,  and an equally extensive collection of
              written sources from the  seventeenth century through the present, DARE
              includes words, phrases,  and pronunciations that vary from one part of the
              country to another or  from one social group to another. The Dictionary
              provides full  historical treatment, with pronunciations, variant forms,
              etymologies,  regional labels, social and usage labels, definitions, dated
              quotations,  and cross-references, as appropriate. A unique feature of DARE is
              the  inclusion (within the text) of maps showing the regional distribution of 
              words, phrases, and forms. Volume I, containing introductory matter and  the
              letters A-C, was published in 1985 to the acclaim of scholars,  reviewers, and
              the public as well. Volume II (D-H) was published in  1991, and Volume III
              (I-O) is scheduled to appear in 1996. Three more  volumes, the last of which
              will also contain the bibliography, a  cumulative index, contrastive regional
              and social maps, and a summary of  all responses collected in the fieldwork,
              will complete the project.  Volumes will appear at approximately five-year
              intervals. DARE will not  only provide a full record of regional American
              English, but will also  furnish, both in the Dictionary text and in the raw
              materials, the  resources to stimulate much further linguistic research.    ***
