Abstract    :
              9408160  Nyerges       This award will provide partial support to a NATO
              Advanced  Research Workshop to permit the participation of seven U.S. 
              scientists and two graduate students.  The workshop on Cognitive  Aspects of
              Human-Computer Interaction for Geographic Information  Systems is organized by
              Timothy Nyerges, University of  Washington; Robert Laurini, Universite Claude
              Bernard in Lyon,  France; and Sr. Maurici Ruiz, Universitat de les Illes in 
              Balears, Spain.  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an  enabling
              information technology that has been developed for use  within research and
              applied settings.  Its effectiveness depends  upon the user interface. Research
              perspectives from cognitive  science, computer science, informatics, and
              geography are needed  to investigate cognitive aspects of the human-computer 
              interaction (HCI).      This workshop focuses on HCI research issues, includes 
              experts from the computer science community, and takes advantage  of an
              international interest in the topic, all lacking from  earlier, related
              meetings.  The workshop is designed to identify  research issues as well as
              intellectual linkages that will result  in research collaborations.  ***
