              Development Company  is to emphasize:  1.  design, remediation and sustainable 
              technologies; 2. geosynthetics in geo-environment engineering; 3. 
              computational and numerical methods including Waste/contaminant  transport,
              GIS/GPS utilization, and risk assessment.  Improvement  in geo-environmental
              mitigation planning would benefit the regio  through enhanced quality of life,
