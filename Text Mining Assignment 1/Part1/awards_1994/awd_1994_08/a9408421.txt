Abstract    :
              9408421  Meagher   With support from the Sloan Foundation and Rutgers
              University, the principal investigators are bringing together an impressive
              group of 45 evolutionary biologists at a workshop devoted to identifying the
              roles that can be played by evolutionary biology in solving applied problems
              faced by society today.  Key areas to be discussed will be 1) environmental
              biotechnology and bioremediation; 2) phenotypic expression in novel
              environments (including genetically engineered organisms); 3) novel products
              and processes; and 4) biodiversity and conservation.  During the workshop,
              carefully designed sets of questions will be tackled during facilitated
              break-out sessions.  Responses will be captured in a workshop report, which
              will be disseminated to a variety of audiences including evolutionary
              biologists, industry representatives, policy makers, and funding agencies.  The
              two investigators have prior experience in running  workshops for scientists to
              discuss applied aspects of their research.  Facilities are well appointed and
              well organized. Current national attention to environmental problems and
              challenges promises a ready audience for the deliberations of this large group
              of evolutionary biologists.
