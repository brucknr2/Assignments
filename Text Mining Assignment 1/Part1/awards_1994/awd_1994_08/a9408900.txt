Abstract    :
                      9408900  Ho  The plant hormone, gibberellin (GA), exerts regulatory
              roles in  several important physiological and developmental processes such as 
              seed germination and post-germination growth, stem elongation and  flower
              induction.  Gibberellin and another hormone, abscisic acid  (ABA), are known to
              regulate the synthesis and secretion of several  enzymes which are responsible
              for the utilization of nutrients  stored in cereal grains.  The most abundant
              among these enzymes are  the starch-degrading alpha-amylases and the storage
              protein-  degrading proteinases.  As the continuation of long term effort in 
              elucidating the mode of action of these two plant hormones, the  effect of
              hormones on the coordinated expression of alpha-amylase  and protease genes
              will be studied in the aleurone layers of  germinating barley seeds. 
              Specifically it is planned to: 1)  analyze the cis-acting elements in the
              protease promoter that are  responsible for hormonal regulation, 2) investigate
              how GA and ABA  regulate the level/activity of this DNA binding protein, and 3)
               isolate and characterize cDNA clones for "early" GA-induced genes  whose
              expression has been suggested to be important for later  alpha-amylase and
              proteinase expression.  It is hoped that the  information obtained in this
              proposed project will contribute to  our understanding of the molecular action
              of these hormones on gene  regulation in plants.  ***
