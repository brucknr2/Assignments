Abstract    :
                            9408826  DellaPenna  A long-term goal of this research is
              understanding the functional  significance of developmentally regulated,
              polyuronide  modifications in plants.  As part of prior NSF funding, the Beta- 
              subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1) was purified; cDNAs encoding the  protein
              were isolated and characterized.  Beta-subunit mRNA  accumulates to high levels
              in developing fruit and is to a large  degree temporally separated from
              catalytic PG2 expression.   Homologous sequences have been identified in a wide
              variety of  plant species suggesting a broad functional role for the protein in
               plants.  The current working theory is that the Beta-subunit  defines a new
              class of bifunctional plant cell wall proteins that  interact both with
              structural components of the wall and catalytic  proteins, to localize and/or
              regulate metabolic activities within  the cell wall.  This hypothesis can now
              be tested in transgenic  tomoto fruit in which Beta-subunit expression is
              inhibited by  antisense RNA.  The proposed research will further address long- 
              standing questions of how pectin-degrading enzymes are targeted and  regulated
              in plants and what the functional significance of pectin  degradation is in
              various tissues and cell types.  ***
