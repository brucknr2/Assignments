Abstract    :
              9408619  Grossman  This research will examine the behavior of the British stock 
              market before World War 1. The major goal of the study is to  understand how
              the development of the market for industrial  equities in Britain contributed
              to the industrial decline of  Britain relative to the United States and
              Germany. It is  noted that the price-dividend ratio in the pre-World War 1 
              Britain was much lower than it was later in Britain, and  much lower than in
              other countries. The study proposes to  construct new indices of British
              industrial stock prices to  examine the extent to which British industrial
              firms found  it difficult to raise capital, whether British firms were  fearful
              of "high-tech" firms, and whether the slow growth of  managerial capitalism was
              due to cultural differences.       This study is important because the results
              would shed  light on the general process of economic growth, and  moreover a
              fuller understanding of Britain's past would  greatly aid in formulating policy
              for America's future.
