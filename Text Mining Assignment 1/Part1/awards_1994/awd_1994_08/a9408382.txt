Abstract    :
              9408382  Inouye    The value of long-term biological data sets has been
              increasingly recognized in recent years, for the insights that they can provide
              on the dynamics of population biology, the frequency of unusual events, the
              consequences of climate change, and the nature of interactions among species. 
              Despite this recognition that number of long-term data sets available for
              analysis is still quite small.  One reason for this paucity is that generation
              of such data sets typically involves long-term monitoring, which may be show
              (especially at the rate of 1 datum/yr) to generate data necessary before
              hypotheses can be tested, manipulative experiments designed, or publications
              produced.  This project will extend collection of data on several aspects of
              the ecology of herbaceous plants in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including the
              abundance and phenology of flowering and the abundance and seasonality of
              insect pollinators.  Approximately 100 species of plants will be included in
              this study.  This project builds on a continuing endeavor that began in 1973 at
              the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, and already provides one of the
              longest available data sets on flowering.  Data from the existing data set have
              been included in three recent publications.  The data will be accessible and of
              interest to a large number of active researchers.
