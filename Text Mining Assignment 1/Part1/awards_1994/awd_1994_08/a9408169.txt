Abstract    :
              Decomposition of woody litter is a major process contributing to biogeochemical
              cycling and productivity in forested ecosystems.  Because woody litter can
              amount to 22% of above biomass, it represents a substantial source of nutrients
              for plant uptake and carbon dioxide for release to the atmosphere.  However,
              factors affecting decomposition and rate of carbon dioxide and nutrient release
              from logs remain poorly known.  Saprotroph colonization patterns and
              biodiversity, as affected by moisture content, have been ascribed and important
              role in the decomposition process.  The importance of these factors has not
              been evaluated experimentally.  Our objective is to evaluate the influence of
              log moisture content and Saprotroph community development on log decomposition
              and mineralization rates.  We will test hypothesis that (1) initial rates of
              decomposition processes are determined by the depth of penetration by insects
              and establishment of decay vs. non-decay fungi, (2) decomposition rate is a
              function of moisture content of logs, and (3) decomposition rate is positively
              related to the diversity of the saprotroph community.  We expect decomposition
              and mineralization rates to increase incrementally from uncolonized logs to
              logs penetrated by insect tunnels, to insect tunnels colonized by decay and/or
              non-decay fungi.  These hypotheses will be tested by comparing changes in wood
              density and carbon/nutrient losses due to fragmentation, respiration, and
              leaching in Douglas-fir logs with manipulated moisture content and manipulated
              initial saprotroph colonization (phloem borers vs. sapwood borers, non-decay
              fungi vs. decay fungi).  Manipulation of saprotroph establishment in
              decomposing logs will indicate the functional importance of biodiversity to
              this ecosystem process.
