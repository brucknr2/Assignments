Abstract    :
              9408878  Rose       The award is for the development of appropriate ultrasonic 
              sensors for monitoring of powder injection molding processes.   Ultrasonic
              sensors will be used in the die cavity to sense  conditions such as short
              shot/incomplete fillings, flash, jetting,  coring, porosity or voids, cracking,
              feedstock inconsistencies, and  density variations.  Real time monitoring of
              the melt front is also  proposed.  In addition to bulk wave techniques, guided
              waves  techniques will also be used to enable more complete in situ  monitoring
              of the material in the die cavity.  Material  characterization studies will
              also be performed and will include  bulk and shear moduli from the ultrasonic
              measurements.       Improved understanding of the powder injection molding
              process  will result from use of the sensors to be developed here.  High 
              performance products developed for aerospace, automotive, and  medical
              applications are expected to benefit form this technology.
