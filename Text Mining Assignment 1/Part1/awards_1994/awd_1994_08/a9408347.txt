Abstract    :
              9408347  Vilgalys       The oyster mushrooms, genus Pleurotus of the
              Basidiomycetes,  are important as wood degrading fungi, and some species are
              choice  edible mushrooms which are collected or cultivated in many  countries. 
              Professor Rytas Vilgalys of Duke University is studying  the patterns of
              species differences in the genus throughout its  worldwide distribution. 
              Conventional taxonomic study of morphology  and of mating systems is being
              combined with modern analyses of  nuclear ribosomal gene sequences, using
              numerous samples collected  from field trips and from colleagues.  Laboratory
              growth studies  will be performed to determine mating systems and the limits of
               intersterility groups.  A simple yet ingenious "spore trapping"  technique is
              also being employed, whereby petri dishes with several  tester strains are
              exposed for 48 hours to the local spore rain and  results of hyphal fusion
              monitored.  Concurrent molecular analyses  focus on DNA sequence data derived
              from the worldwide sample of  Pleurotus.  Results of the studies will help
              answer several  questions relevant to speciation in fungi: (1) how old are 
              different species groups, under a molecular clock model; (2) what  are the
              genealogical or phylogenetic relationships among the  species; and (3) what are
              the relationships between geographic  distribution and levels of morphological,
              molecular, and mating  system variability.       By providing comprehensive
              taxonomic descriptions for each  species from geographically diverse regions,
              the study will also  provide a baseline for developing commercially useful
              strains of  oyster mushrooms for cultivation and biotechnology.
