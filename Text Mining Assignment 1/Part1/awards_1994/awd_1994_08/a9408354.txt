Abstract    :
              9408354  Peters  U. of Colorado  The dynamics of photodissociation of alkyl and
              vinyl halides will be examined by picosecond absorption spectroscopy. The
              reaction mechanism involves both homolysis and heterolysis to produce radical
              pairs and contact ion pairs in polar solvents. On the picosecond time-scale the
              contact ion pairs decay by covalent bond formation as well as diffusional
              separation to form solvent separated ion pairs. The latter species decay by
              collapse to a contact ion pair or diffusionally separate to free ions. The
              project will include: (1) An investigation of the mechanism for the
              photochemical production of radical pairs and contact ion pairs, (2) The
              determination of activation parameters for covalent bond formation between a
              carbocation and an anion, and how solvent effects this process, (3) The role of
              solvent on the inter conversion between contact and solvent separated ion
              pairs, and how this depends on molecular structure of the ions.     This grant
              by the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Professor Kevin
              S. Peters at the University of Colorado. A pulsed ultraviolet laser beam in the
              picosecond (one billionth of a second) domain will be used to break
              carbon-chloride bonds with the goal of generating positively charged carbon
              species (carbocations). These reactive intermediates may be in direct contact
              with a negatively charged species (an anion) or the carbocation and anion may
              be separated by a limited number of solvent molecules. The dynamic behavior
              these contact and solvent separated ion pairs as a function of solvent and
              molecular structure will be investigated.
