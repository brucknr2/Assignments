Abstract    :
              9408558   Myers      Free energies of phase formation of binary solid silicide
              phases of  the Group VIII (Iron, Cobalt, Nickel) transition metals will be 
              measured by means of a reactive effusion scheme coupled with mass 
              spectrometric analysis of the effusing vapors.  Silicides will be  equilibrated
              with solid Silicon Dioxide at temperatures in the  range of 800-1500 K. The
              gibbs free energies of formation will be  calculated from the measured Silicon
              Mono-oxide(g) pressures  combined with literature data for the equilibrium
              between these  components.  These results will be combined with heat capacity
              and  entropy data to compute standard enthalpies of formation at 298 K.   The
              results are expected to be useful in the modeling of a variety  of
              metallurgical problems, in the verification of phase diagram  features, and in
              the development and modeling of chemical vapor  deposition processes used in
              the electronics industry.   %%%   The stabilities of compounds of silicon with
              cobalt, nickel and  iron (i.e. strengths of chemical bonds) will be measured by
              high  temperature techniques involving a study of reactions between these 
              materials and silicon dioxide.  Results are expected to be useful  in
              development and modeling of processes used in the electronics  industry and in
              modeling of metallurgical problems.    ***
