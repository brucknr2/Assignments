Abstract    :
              This  research  covers two closely related areas of collaboration technology:
              collaborative tools and infrastructures. In the  area of  collaborative tools,
              it is addressing the potential of  these tools  for  making distributed
              collaborative software engineering tasks  more concurrent,  thereby allowing 
              these  time-consuming tasks to be completed significantly more quickly. In the
              area  of collaborative infrastructures, it is addressing support for
              nearautomatic  generation of efficient, collaborative tools, thereby
              significantly  reducing the tremendous amount of effort  required to  program 
              these tools manually. These two efforts are  related since the infrastructure
              is being used to build the tools and the tools are being used to evaluate the
              infrastructure. Some of  the specific  issues being addressed include security,
               consistency, computer support for gathering software engineering requirements,
              and asynchronous software engineering meetings. The research  is using an
              experimental method wherein the infrastructure and tools are  being 
              implemented  and used in case studies.  The  research results  will  include: 
              taxonomies of collaboration  scenarios; principles,   interaction  models,
              software  abstractions,   and architectures that support these scenarios; and
              evaluation of the infrastructure and tools being developed.
