Abstract    :
              9408739  Dufour       This research involves a graduate student in  anthropology
              from the University of Colorado studying how  Colombian Indians use different
              varieties of manioc.  This  food plant is a staple in many tropical places, and
              grows in  a "bitter" (i.e., poisonous) and "sweet" variety.  The  bitter
              varieties are often planted even though they require  a long procedure of food
              processing in order to extract the  poisons.  The student will study the
              productivity of the  plants, their disease resistance, how the people treat
              them  and why they prefer some varieties to others, using a series  of
              techniques including chemical analysis of the plants and  cognitive tests of
              the farmer's perceptions of differences  in the plants.  Yields and damages to
              roots will be measured  for sweet and bitter manioc in 20 family gardens and
              one  control garden.       This research will enhance our understanding of
              human  adaptation to tropical rain forests, particularly to black  water river
              systems.  The knowledge to be gained will be  valuable for agricultural
              planners and economic development  advisers in all tropical areas where manioc
              is an important  food plant.
