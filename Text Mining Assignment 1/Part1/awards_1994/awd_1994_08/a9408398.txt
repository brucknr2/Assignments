Abstract    :
                    9408398    Stoneking/ Stone    The recovery of ancient DNA from human
              remains has great  potential to address anthropological issues concerning 
              migration, residence patterns and genetic relationships of  ancient human
              populations.  To date, however, only a few  researchers have applied these
              techniques to archaeological  questions.  The technical issues are very
              difficult to  resolve.    This project on a completely excavated cemetery, the
              Norris  Farms #36 site in Illinois, integrates genetcis,  archaeology, and
              osteology in a new and powerful way to  analyze the social organization and
              genetics of pre-  Columbian poulations.  It dates to 1300 A.D. and represents 
              a "frontier" society of the Oneonta cultural tradition.  The  DNA extracted
              from the skeletons will be used to determine  the sex and genetic relatedness
              of members of this society  to clarify aspects of social organization such as
              post-  marital residence patterns, status and cemetery  organization.    The
              project will also result in the effective training of an  excellent young
              researcher in this exciting area of  research.
