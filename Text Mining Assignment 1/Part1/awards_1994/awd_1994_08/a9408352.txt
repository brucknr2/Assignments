Abstract    :
              9408352  Muller  Support is requested to assist academic personnel (particularly
              younger researchers) who are engaged in sensor and actuator research by
              providing either wholly or partially for travel and  subsistence at the 1994
              Sensor and Actuator Workshop which is to be held at Hilton Head, South Carolina
              for June 13-16, 1994.  The cost of attending this important Workshop is often
              not included in the budgets of some, particularly younger, researchers.  These
              are precisely the persons whose presence is likely to produce long-range impact
              for the engineering and scientific communities in the United States.  ***
