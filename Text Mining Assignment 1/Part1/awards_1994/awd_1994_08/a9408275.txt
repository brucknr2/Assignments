Abstract    :
              9408275  Veziroglu    Description:  This project supports research 
              collaboration between a U.S. team headed by Dr.  T.N. Veziroglu and Dr. Nelson
              Nemerow, of the  U. of Miami, and a team from the Indian  National
              Environmental Engineering Research  Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur, India, headed
              by  Dr. P. Khanna.  The objective of the research  is to determine the
              feasibility of locating,  building and operating a two-industry complex, 
              consisting of a phosphate fertilizer and a  cement plant, within an
              environmentally  balanced industrial complex at one site.  An  analytical model
              will be developed from data  obtained to produce an optimum mass balance for 
              the fertilizer-cement plants complex during the  first phase of the project,
              and laboratory  bench prototypes will be built to test the  modeling results
              during the second phase.  The  focus will be on relating the various 
              parameters to a cost-effective, waste-reducing,  and environmentally
              satisfactory model for the  production of these two materials.    Scope:  This
              project deals with an idea that is  simple and also attractive, but which has
              not  been implemented yet.  The reason is the  existence of unknown variables
              and their impact  on the viability and efficiency of the  procedure.  In this
              research, involving experts  from the U.S. with industrial concerns and 
              environmental engineering specialists from  India, it is expected that these
              variables and  their impacts will be defined. This information  should lead to
              the selection of optimum  conditions for implementation.  The project  will
              benefit from the complementary resources  in the U.S. and India, and the
              benefits are  likely to accrue to the two countries.  ***
