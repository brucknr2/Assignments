Abstract    :
              9408733  Eberly      The current work focuses on three areas; sub-Casimir
              effects  and related vacuum fluctuation phenomena in dynamically distorted 
              cavities, analytic eigen-solutions for a unique two-channel model  in a
              multi-mode theory and a recent discovery of dressed fields  and a new class of
              solitons for three level media.  The research  is likely to have significant
              impact on our understanding of the  fundamental nature of laser-matter
              interactions.  ***
