              representatives  from the numerous constituencies which are essential for the 
              design, development, deployment, and operation of a robust, high  performance
              computer network to meet pressing needs for improved  research collaboration
              and productivity in the United States.    It is important that the conference
              have wide participant  involvement especially from the academic community in
              order to  provide a forum for presenting and deliberating on the major issues 
              connected with creation of the NREN and its impact on the research  and
              education communities.
