Abstract    :
              CTS-9408414  University of Toledo  G. Glenn Lipscomb      The research deals
              with mass transfer in hollow membrane modules, particularly the effect of flows
              external to the fiber bundle.  Hollow fiber membranes are being used
              increasingly in a variety of separation processes such as filtration, reverse
              osmosis, dialysis, gas purification, and pervaporation.  Theory will be
              developed to predict the shell-side velocity fields.  In particular, the
              effects of parameters such as fiber packing uniformity and module dimensions on
              the fluid residence time distribution will be determined.  The model will be
              extended to include simultaneous mass transfer from fiber lumen to the shell. 
              The theoretical results will be verified using hollow fiber artificial kidneys.
               The proposed research is expected to lead to improved designs of large-scale
              membrane modules based on engineering principles rather than trial-and-error
              experiments.  An understanding of mass transfer and its effective control are
              necessary for wide scale application of membrane separations important to 
              biotechnology, water treatment and hence civil infrastructure, environment and
              manufacturing.
