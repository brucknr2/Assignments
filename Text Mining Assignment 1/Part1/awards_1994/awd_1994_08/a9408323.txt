Abstract    :
              9408323  Harnishfeger      The goal of this RPG project is to investigate
              developmental changes in cognitive inhibition in children's memory performance.
               Cognitive inhibition is defined as the process of actively suppressing
              previously activated cognitive contents of cognitive processes.  The
              theoretical basis of this research is that children's cognitive inhibition
              increases in efficiency with age over the middle childhood years, and this
              increasing efficiency contributes to developmental improvements in memory
              performance.  This research will focus on one specific form of inhibition,
              retrieval inhibition, which has been identified as a central component of
              performance in directed-forgetting memory tasks.  Results from this research
              will be important in the continuing attempt to determine the underlying bases
              for age-related improvements in memory and cognitive processing.
