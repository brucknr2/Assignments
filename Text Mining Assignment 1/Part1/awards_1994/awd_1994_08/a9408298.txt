Abstract    :
                Constraint logic programming is a declarative programming  paradigm which has
              proven to be expressive for  computationally difficult  problems such as
              scheduling, air  traffic flow management, simulation of dynamic  physical 
              systems, solution of differential equations, and options  trading  analysis. 
              However, while CLP languages are  expressive, their execution is not  always
              efficient enough  for the problems to which they apply.  The goal of this 
              research is to develop strategies for fast execution of  constraint logic 
              programs, particularly in the domain of  real or rational arithmetic 
              constraints.  To this end,  incremental Gaussian elimination-based and 
              simplex-based  constraint satisfaction algorithms are compared for their 
              efficiency in the context of CLP; the feasibility of  intelligent backtracking 
              and independent and-parallelism is  investigated; work on asynchronous parallel
               execution of the  inference engine and solver is continued; and parallel 
              incremental algorithms for constraint solving are being  developed.   The  
              research program has strong  undergraduate involvement and  research
              components. Students  are involved in the design, implementation,  and testing 
              of algorithms, and are exposed to concepts from the  theory of  computation,
              programming language design, the  linear programming problem, AI  search and
              backtracking  strategies, and parallel computation.
