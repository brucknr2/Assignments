Abstract    :
              9408798  Chichilnisky        Recent developments have deepened the connection
              between topology and  the economics of markets.  This workshop will allow the
              presentation and  discussion of original mathematical results, which have or
              could lead to  useful applications in the economics of markets.  The first
              three days of the  workshop will be devoted to a series of mini-courses in
              mathematics aimed at  providing the basic background.  The remaining time will
              allow the  presentation of new theorems, along with their applications to the
              theory of  markets.  Topics discussed will include: new topological invariants
              for  existence, characterization and computation of market equilibria and their
               relation to social choice and to other forms of resource allocation, 
              competitive and cooperative systems, algebraic geometry and markets with 
              increasing returns, computational complexity, and stochastic processes and 
              financial markets.
