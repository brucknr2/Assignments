Abstract    :
              9408371  Wilmsen  The major objectives of this research are to:  a) Demonstrate
              that  VCSEL-based smart pixel arrays can be used in high performance  parallel
              optoelectronic processing systems.  b) Isolate the barrier  technologies to the
              development of a practical parallel processing  system.  c) Develop the
              design/fabrication methodology for these  VCSEL-based systems.  d) Demonstrate
              the potential of optical  computing for database processing.  e) Investigate
              the interface  between optical parallel memories and optical processing arrays.
