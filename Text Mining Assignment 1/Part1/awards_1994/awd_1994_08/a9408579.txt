Abstract    :
              9408579  Haussler  This award will support research in the development of
              statistical methods, algorithms and  software for the analysis of protein and
              RNA sequence data based on generalization of the  hidden Markov model. 
              Specifically the investigators will use and develop Hidden Markov  Models,
              Stochastic Graph Grammars, and Markov Random Fields.  These methods would  have
              applications to inverse folding, multiple alignment and database searching in
              molecular  and structural biology.  This award is supported by programs in
              Computational Biology and  the Theory of Computing.
