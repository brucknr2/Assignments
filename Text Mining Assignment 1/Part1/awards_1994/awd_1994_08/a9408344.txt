Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    CTS-9408344  CHARLES MENEVEAU  JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY      The
              proposed research is an experimental study of turbulence small-scales from the
              point of view of subgrid modeling fop Large-Eddy-Simulation, a technique of
              increasing engineering usefulness in dealing with the `turbulence problem'. The
              measurements are to be performed at high Reynolds numbers, using
              multi-component hot-wire anemometry. The main flow to be studied is the
              `complex wake', a free shear-flow that displays both a  non-monotonic energy
              spectrum as well as spatial complexity. Comparisons between real and modeled
              subgrid stresses will be performed using several reference quantities. For
              example, the rate at which the real stress dissipates large-scale kinetic
              energy will be compared to the rate of dissipation accomplished by the models.
              Other quantities on which the comparisons will be based relate to energy
              spectra, enstrophy, probability-density functions, correlation coefficients,
              etc.  Measurements will be performed across distinct flow regions and regimes,
              in order to explore the impact of complex geometry. Also, the analysis will be
              based on a wide range of length-scales or filter sizes, in order to ascertain
              the effect of the spectral complexity (e.g. spectral `humps') expected in
              regions of the proposed flow-field. Models that will be scrutinized include
              eddy-viscosity models, similarity and non-linear models, global and local
              dynamic models, etc.. This research is expected to significantly contribute to
              the foundation of Large-Eddy-Simulation and associated modeling in complex flow
              conditions, based on real data at high Reynolds numbers.
