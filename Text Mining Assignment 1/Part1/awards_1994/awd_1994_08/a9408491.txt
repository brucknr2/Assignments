Abstract    :
              9408491  Harvell    The malacology collections of Cornell University will be
              transferred to the Paleontological Research Institute, on long-term loan, and
              housed in modern specimen cabinets.  The specimens will be curated and restored
              while at PRI.  Cornell is paying the cost of the move and has already absorbed
              much of the cost of capturing label information in a data retrieval system. 
              The specimens will be more valuable and more accessible than previously.
