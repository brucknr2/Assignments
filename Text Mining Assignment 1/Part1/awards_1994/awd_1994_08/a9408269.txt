Abstract    :
              9408269  Eldon                              ABSTRACT                            
                                                                                   Once an
              egg cell divides, the two cells communicate with  each other.  If separated
              they would each divide to make a  complete organism, but if they remain
              together, each  contributes to half the organism.  How and what embryonic 
              cells signal to each other, then, is critical for normal  development.  Dr.
              Eldon is using embryonic development in  the fruit fly, Drosophila
              melanogaster, to study a protein  that may mediate communication between cells.
               From this  study we hope to learn how signals between cells are  transmitted
              and received.
