Abstract    :
                This project concentrates on propositional proof systems, Boolean  complexity,
              and parallel/sequential computable functionals of higher types.  The project
              specifically concerns: (1) upper and  lower bounds for the number of  symbols
              in proofs of various combinatorial statements for an extension of  resolution
              called  cutting planes, originating in operations research, as well  as  for
              related prepositional logics (logics of approximate reasoning  or  threshold
              logics, logics with the bi-conditional, with modular  counting gates,  etc.);
              (2) the relation between the parallel complexity of a language L and the 
              algebraic structure of so-called invariance groups and extended invariance 
              groups  corresponding to L (structure of invariance groups of regular and 
              context free languages, structure of extended invariance groups  of fast 
              parallel computable languages, invariance groups of  monotonic versus 
              non-monotonic boolean functions, relation to  Krohn-Rhodes semi-group theory); 
              and (3) the study of variants of the scheme of bounded primitive recursion 
              applied to higher type  functionals (functions whose arguments may be 
              functions), and the  study of parallel computable real valued functions.   This
               research applies techniques from complexity theory, proof theory (mathematical
               logic), combinatorics and finite group  theory.  Initial experimental studies
              of  extended invariance  groups will be done using a parallel computer.  The
              goal of  this  research is to increase our understanding of low level parallel
              complexity   and associated logics with long term possible  applications in
              logic programming,   database update methods, VLSI  design, and programming
              language design.
