Abstract    :
              9408670     Fritzsche    Technical abstract:  The research is aimed at
              understanding how  light produces defects and other changes in the local
              structure of  amorphous semiconductors.  These changes can be beneficial such
              as  in chalcogenide glasses used for photolithography or in Indium  oxide films
              for controlling the electronic properties of  transparent electrodes.  On the
              other hand, they can be detrimental  leading to photodegration of amorphous
              silicon solar cells.  These  photo-induced changes occur during recombination
              of photo-excited  electron-hole pairs.  The study of the temperature dependence
              of  the recombination and transport of photocarriers and of the defect 
              generation-kinetics will help us to understand the microscopic  mechanisms of
              the light-induced changes.  Use will be made of  spatially confining the
              photocarriers in ultra-thin layers of  amorphous semiconductors to explore the
              effect of reduced  dimensionality.  The light-induced changes will be used in
              Indium  oxide to explore changes in electronic conduction ad the electronic 
              states become localized.    non-technical abstract:  The research is aimed at
