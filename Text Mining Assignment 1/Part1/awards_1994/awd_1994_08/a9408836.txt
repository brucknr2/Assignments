              Abstract  ATM-9408836  Foley, Jonathan       University of Wisconsin  Title:
              Climate and Terrestrial Biosphere Interactions:  Investigations with Coupled
              Models    Interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere 
              will be investigated with a suite of numerical models.  A land  surface model
              (LSX) is coupled to a global ecosystem model,  DEMETER, which was developed at
              the University of Wisconsin.   DEMETER describes the structure and dynamics of
              global vegetation  communities and terrestrial carbon pools.  The PI is
              investigating  the interactions (biophysical and biochemical) between the 
              atmosphere, biosphere and land surfaces for the following climatic  regimes:
              (1) the current climate, (2) the mid-Holocene and (3) a  2xCO2 scenario.   
              This research is important because it seek to understand and model  fundamental
              processes related to climate change.    The project is funded under the USGCRP
              CMAP initiative.
