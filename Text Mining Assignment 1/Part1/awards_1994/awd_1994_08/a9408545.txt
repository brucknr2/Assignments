Abstract    :
              9408545  Iwasaki       When humans reason about the behavior of the physical
              world,  reasoning with images plays a crucial role.  However, artificial 
              intelligence has so far mostly ignored visual reasoning,  concentrating instead
              on the use of propositional representation  methods, which are not necessarily
              suited for representing  primarily spatial information.  The proposed work aims
              at  developing techniques for making use of diagrammatic reasoning  techniques
              in the context of predicting behavior of spatially  interacting objects.  A
              general architecture for diagrammatic  reasoning systems will be designed and
              programs based on  architecture that solve such problems using a diagram in a
              way  similar to that of humans will be implemented.
