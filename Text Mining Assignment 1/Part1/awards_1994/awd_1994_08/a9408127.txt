Abstract    :
              9408127  Alber  Carbohydrates are a major component of the dissolved organic
              carbon (DOC) in natural waters.  The purpose of the projected research will be
              to examine carbohydrate dynamics in aquatic systems from both a biogeochemical
              and a trophodynamic (e.g., microbial loop) perspective.  The biogeochemical
              perspective involves comparing the carbohydrate composition of various source
              materials (terrestrial and aquatic plants, macroalgae, phytoplankton,
              zooplankton, bacteria) to determine whether there are biochemically consistent
              compositional differences that would be useful indicators of sources of DOC in
              natural waters.  There has been only a limited amount of work to date on this
              question, in large part because of the analytic difficulty of detecting
              individual carbohydrates.  The proposed work will seek to extend previous
              studies on the carbohydrate composition of source material and to test the
              utility of using carbohydrate signatures as geochemical tracers by comparing
              them to measurements made in field samples.  If this approach proves fruitful,
              it will improve understanding of the relative contribution of various sources
              of DOC to natural waters.
