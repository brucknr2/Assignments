Abstract    :
              9408527  Green      The PIs will convene a workshop in February 1994 at Lake
              Arrowhead, CA, to bring together about 20 researchers from the different fields
              within geophysics that are studying the different aspects of deep-focus
              earthquakes.  This workshop will be run as part of the CSEDI initiative, and
              may result in the submission of one or more collaborative interdisciplinary
              research proposals within that initiative.  ****
