Abstract    :
              This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program, is  concerned with the synthesis, and the physical and chemical
              characterization of polynuclear  compounds that contain both transition
              elements (M) and heavy non-transition metal elements  (E) as an integral part
              of the cluster framework.  Synthetic strategies to be followed include 1) 
              substitution of E-bound halide in existing cluster compounds, 2) homolytic
              bismuth-carbon bond  cleavage in metallated bismuth compounds to reactive
              fragments for coupling reactions, 3) redox  reactions on existing stable small
              clusters to generate reactive fragments that may couple to give  larger
              fragments, 4) reactions of known Group 9 and 10 metal clusters with "bare"
              bismuth  atoms generated by thermal decomposition of bismuth hydride, 5) the
              reactions of bismuth and  antimony Zintl ions with transition metal compounds
              that have readily substituted ligands, and  6) cathodic dissolution of bismuth
              alloys in the presence of ligands to trap the anticipated small  anionic
              clusters.    It is increasingly clear that alloys and compounds that contain
              transition metals and non-metallic  elements have interesting and potentially
              technologically important electronic and magnetic  properties, and unique
              catalytic properties.  However, the fundamental aspects of the bonding 
              interactions between transition metals and heavy non-metallic elements has
              received little  attention so that interpretation and prediction of properties
              are currently impossible.  This project  has as its primary objective the
              acquisition of information concerning interactions of such  elements through
              the study of cluster compounds that contain bonds between transition metal 
              atoms and non-metallic elements.  Decomposition reactions of these clusters may
              also lead to  new alloys with useful properties.
