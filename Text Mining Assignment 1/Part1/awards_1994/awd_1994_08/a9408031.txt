Abstract    :
                          9408031  Leustek  Two enzymes, ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase,
              catalyze the  activation of sulfate in plants leading to the synthesis of
              sulfur  containing compounds vital for cell function.  Isoenzymes of ATP 
              sulfurylase are compartmentalized in chloroplasts, mitochondria and  the
              cytosol, suggesting that they may play distinct physiological  roles in sulfur
              metabolism.  The objective of this research is to  study the expression of the
              isoenzymes in order to establish a  molecular basis for the control of sulfate
              activation.   cDNAs  encoding the sulfate activating enzymes were cloned from 
              Arabidopsis thaliana by complementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ATP
              sulfurylase, met3, or APS kinase, met14, mutants.  Four members  of the ATP
              sulfurylase gene family and one encoding APS kinase have  been isolated.  It is
              proposed to further characterize these cDNAs  and to study their expression and
              function in A. thaliana and  Brassica juncea.  Since sulfur-containing peptides
              play a  significant role in resistance to heavy metals, the influence of  heavy
              metal exposure will be investigated on expression of ATP  sulfurylase and APS
              kinase.  These studies will help advance our  understanding of plant
              metabolism, growth, development and response  to stress.  ***
