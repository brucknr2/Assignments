Abstract    :
                   9408402   Ken Weiss      Teeth and their comparative features have been of
              central  importance in physical anthropology.  They are among the 
              best-preserved traits, and so are critical in fossil  studies.  Yet the genetic
              control over their development and  different morphologies is not understood at
              all.    This ground-breaking project will use evolutionary  approaches to adapt
              the knowledge we have gained on  developmental genetics in  mice to primate
              dental variation.  The Dlx and Msx genes will be searched for regulatory genes 
              expressed in teeth.  The coding and adjacent regulatory  regions of one gene
              will be sequenced in a homodont species,  and a divergent heterodont, and four
              divergent primates.  The aligned sequences will be searched for control
              elements  conserved across the entire evolution of teeth, and those  elements
              whose variation may correspond phylogenitically to  changes in dental
              morphology during primate evolution.
