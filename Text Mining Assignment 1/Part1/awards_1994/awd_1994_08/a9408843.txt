Abstract    :
              9408843  Walker  This is a proposal to continue an on-going program studying 
              nuclear reactions, nuclear structure physics at intermediate  energies, and the
              interface between nuclear and particle theory.  We propose research in the
              following areas:  the role of  retardation and relativistic effects in
              modifying the nuclear  response; the study of exclusive meson production
              reactions at  intermediate energies; parton distribution in the nucleon, 
              especially the magnitude of charge symmetry breaking effects in  parton
              distributions.  Finally, we propose to study the  properties of low temperature
              electrons in very narrow two-  dimensional conductors called "quantum wires".
