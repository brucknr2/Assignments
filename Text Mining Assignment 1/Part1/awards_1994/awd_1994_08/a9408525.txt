Abstract    :
              9408525  Weiss  This research will investigate the sources of agricultural 
              productivity growth during the nineteenth century. The goal  of the study is to
              decompose the growth of output per worker  into four key components:  increased
              time at work, increased  effort per unit of time, shifts in the composition of
              farm  output, increased  mechanization, and yield per acre. The  decomposition
              analysis is carried out for men, women and  children in the labor force.  The
              study uses time series  data on the U.S. labor force for 1820 and each of the
              decade  from 1840 to 1900. The basic analysis is extended using  alternative
              estimates of labor input, and accounting for  labor requirements that vary by
              region, among other things.       This study is important because it identifies
              those  sources of agricultural productivity growth that would  enable us to
              gain valuable insights into the role of  agriculture in industrialization and
              vice-versa.
