Abstract    :
              The overall goal of the proposed research is to determine  the mechanism(s) of
              RNA transport into, and localization  within, the Drosophila oocyte and to
              relate such processes  to the establishment of dorsoventral pattern in the
              mature  egg and early embryo.  This research is focused on the  Drosophila
              dorsoventral patterning gene 'fs(1)K10(K10)'.  'K10' RNA is synthesized in
              ovarian nurse cells and  selectively transported via cytoplasmic bridges into
              the  oocyte during early to middle stages of oogenesis.  Several  other
              Drosophila RNAs that play critical roles in egg and  embryonic pattern
              fromation, including 'oskar' and 'bicoid',  are also synthesized in nurse cells
              and selectively  transported into the oocyte.  There is growing evidence that 
              'K10', 'oskar' and 'bicoid' RNA transport occurs along  microtubule tracts and
              therefore is similar in mechanism to  the transport/localization of RNA and
              organelles in higher  organisms.  The proposed studies seek to identify and 
              characterize the cis- and trans-acting regulators of 'K10'  RNA transport.  An
              investigation of 'K10' protein function  will also be carried out.  The PI's
              interest in this stems  from the observation that 'K10' is required for the 
              localization within the oocyte of 'gurken' RNA, which  encodes a TGFalpha-like
              signaling molecule required for the  asymmetric differentiation of the oocyte's
              neighboring  somatic follicle cells.  The proposed studies represent a 
              molecular, genetic, and biochemical approach to the problem  of RNA
              localization/transport and utilize mutagenesis, germ-  line transformation,
              protein-nucleic acid binding, in situ  hybridization, and immunocytochemical
              techniques.
