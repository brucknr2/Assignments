Abstract    :
                  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Stanford University in the purchase
              of an upgrade of their  computational facility using DEC Workstations.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a  number of areas including the following: 
              (1) Dynamics and Structure in Complex Molecular  Systems, (2) High Performance
              Computing for Biophysical Spectroscopy, (3) Electronic  Structures of Active
              Sites, (4) Chemical Reactions Far From Equilibrium, (5) Molecular  Dynamics
              Computer Simulations, and (6) Theoretical and Computational X-ray Absorption 
              Spectroscopy.    A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is
              a new way to satisfy the  computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a
              "computer network" also serves as a  development environment for new
              theoretical codes and algorithms, and provides state-of-the-art  graphics and
              visualization facilities.
