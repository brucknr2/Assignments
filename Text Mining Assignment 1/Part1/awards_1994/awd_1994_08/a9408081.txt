Abstract    :
              9408081  Smethie  The proposed work is the collection and analysis of chloro- 
              fluorocarbon samples on an oceanographic cruise of the RVIB  Nathaniel B.
              Palmer to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas in  early 1994.  This region has
              been sparsely sampled in the past, and  little is known about the regional
              oceanographic processes.    The specific objectives of this cruise are to
              investigate the  large-scale oceanographic features, study the evolution of the
               surface mixed layer and pycnocline in relation to the sea ice cover  and the
              underlying intermediate and deep water masses, determine  the location of the
              Antarctic Slope Front, and to investigate the  impact of warm circumpolar water
              flowing onto the continental  shelf.    The proposed work complements these
              objectives of the cruise, since  the physical and chemical characteristics of
              CFCs are well known  and well suited for the investigation of subsurface water
              mass  formation and water circulation.  Knowledge of the distribution of  CFCs
              in the ocean broadens the time and space scales of the direct  observations,
              and allows inferences about oceanic processes that go  beyond the immediate
              limits of the cruise.  ***
