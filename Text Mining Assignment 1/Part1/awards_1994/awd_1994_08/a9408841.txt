Abstract    :
              9408841  Boyer    This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research
              in  physical modeling of ocean currents between Don L. Boyer, Arizona  State
              University and Peter A. Davies of the University of Dundee.  The objective of
              their research is to develop physical models of  the interaction of tidal
              currents and other unsteady background  flows with bathymetry in the vicinity
              of continental shelf  breaks.  They will investigate phenomenon such as fronts
              and  their instabilities, mean along and cross-isobath volume  transports,
              hydraulic jumps and internal waves.     The collaboration with the University
              of Dundee allows the  investigators to apply this modeling approach to specific
              oceanic  regions.  The U.K. investigator's research is part of a large 
              European Community Marine Science and Technology (MAST) program  that includes
              similar studies along the Iberian and North West  European continental shelves.
               This collaboration takes advantage  of extensive field measurements and
              modeling efforts of MAST.  Their research will provide integrated data sets on
              specific  sites, including the Portuguese section of the Iberian shelf and  the
              Hebridean shelf edge, and should accelerate the modeling  efforts of both
              groups. The results will further our  understanding of physical aspects of
              ocean currents.  ***
