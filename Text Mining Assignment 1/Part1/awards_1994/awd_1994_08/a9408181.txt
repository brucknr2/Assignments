Abstract    :
              Deino    With National Science Foundation support the Berkeley  Geochronology
              Center (BGC) will continue to develop the technique  of 40Ar/39Ar dating and
              apply this technique to a series of  significant paleoanthropological sites.
              The facilities include  two fully automated laser-mass spectrometer systems
              with single-  crystal 40Ar/39Ar dating capability which enables the 
              analytically precise and geologically accurate dating of sub-  milligram single
              volcanic crystals from multi-age component  samples such as tuffaceous
              sediments. The laboratory has also  added a system which can be tailored to
              date young or altered  volcanic materials.    Argon dating is extremely
              important to paleoanthropologists  because it can be used over almost the
              entire last 6 million  years; this is the period when hominids emerged and
              developed.  Many significant archaeological and paleontological sites are 
              located in volcanic regions such as Eastern Africa and contain  sediments which
              can be dated by this technique. The BGC has  collaborated with researchers at a
              number of sites in Africa,  Europe and Asia, and with NSF support such projects
              will be  continued and expanded.
