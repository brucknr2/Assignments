Abstract    :
              9408474  Markiewicz    The feasibility of enhancing critical currents in bulk 
              polycrystalline samples of high temperature superconductors, via a  process of
              biaxial alignment, will be explored, with primary  emphasis on a
              europium-barium-copper-oxide superconductor.  The  quality of intergranular
              junctions produced by a variety of  annealing techniques will be examined by
              studying critical  currents, susceptibility, junction noise, high resolution 
              transmission and scanning transmission microscopy studies of grain  boundaries,
              and microscopic detection of the critical currents  associated with individual
              grain boundaries.  Alternative  approaches for maintaining oxygen stoichiometry
              in the densified  materials will be explored.  Detailed pole figure analyses
              will be  undertaken.  Enhancement of critical currents by pinning (second 
              phase inclusions, irradiation damage) will be explored.    %  %  %  %    To
              reach the full potential of the new high critical temperature  superconductors
              for application in magnets and energy transmission,  superconductor wires or
              tapes must be able to carry large currents  at the temperature of liquid
              nitrogen and must be manufacturable at  reasonable cost.  This program explores
              in depth the physical  parameters controlling a new fabrication process which
              has the  potential for greatly enhanced critical currents by reducing or 
              eliminating harmful grain boundary mismatch.  In this process small  grains are
              aligned both magnetically and mechanically into a  "brick-wall" like network,
              which is then consolidated by heat  treatments to form a high-density material.
