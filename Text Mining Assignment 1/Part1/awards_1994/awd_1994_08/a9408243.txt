Abstract    :
              9408243  Stahl     In this project the structure of microbial communities of
              Lake Michigan anoxic sediments is being characterized using molecular methods
              (RNA sequencing and DNA probes), culture-based techniques, and measurements of
              rates of reduction of alternative electron acceptors.  This research will
              identify and quantify the most abundant microbial populations at different
              depths in the sediments and relate them to depth-associated changes in redox
              state and respiratory mode.    This research will greatly improve our
              understanding of the relationship between microbial community structure and
              anoxic microbial biogeochemical activity, such as anoxic respiration, sulfate
              reduction, metal reduction, and methanogenisis.  These studies should also
              contribute to establishing the connections between sediment and water column
              activities.  The results of this study will have application in understanding
              aquatic ecosystem function and in aquatic pollution studies.
