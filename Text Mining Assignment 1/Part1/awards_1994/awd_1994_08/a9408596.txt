Abstract    :
              9408596  Valentine  Univ. of Calif. - Los Angeles  Dr. Joan S. Valentine,
              Chemistry Department, University of California - Los Angeles, is supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division for research into the activation of dioxygen by metal
              complexes. A central theme will be the development of analogs of biological
              reactions which are catalyzed by metal containing oxygenase enzymes. The
              reactions of peroxides in the presence of non-porphyrinic metal complexes will
              be investigated in hope of developing metal mediated olefin epoxidation and
              alkane hydroxylation processes. The oxygenation of organic substrates in the
              presence of alpha-ketoglutarate will then be investigated. Next similar
              reactions of metalloporphyrin peroxo complexes will be studied. Finally, this
              chemistry will be moved into aqueous solution.    In biological systems,
              enzymes catalyze the incorporation of oxygen into a variety of different
              species. This study is a systematic investigation of model compounds which are
              designed to mimic the behavior of the biological systems. Based on the known
              behavior of oxygenase enzymes, simple systems will be designed to test ideas of
              how these enzymes operate. The result will be a better understanding of how
              living systems utilize oxygen and the development of new laboratory and
              industrial processes for activating oxygen so that it can be incorporated into
              various products.
