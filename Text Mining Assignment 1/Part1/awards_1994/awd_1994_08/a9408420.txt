Abstract    :
              9410989  Brown  This effort will examine failure modes and long term structural
              stability of polysilicon microelectromechnical structures(MEMS).  We find the
              current absence of research on MEMS reliability striking given that many MEMS
              are designed to last long periods of time under adverse conditions. 
              Specifically, we intend to address the following goals.    1. Identify failure
              modes for polysilicon  microelectromechanical  structures.  Long term
              performance  of MEMS cannot be achieved until possible failure modes are 
              understood.    2. Provide a protocol for accelerated testing of MEMS.  
              Although MEMS are meant to operate for decades, they cannot  be tested for that
              period before being put to use.   Accelerated testing techniques must be
              developed to assess  the long term performance of the devices.    3.
              Characterize the reliability of polysilicon structures as a  function of
              processing and geometry.  We have shown the  possibility of crack growth in a
              single crystal silicon  microelectromechanical structure due to environmental 
              effects.  In light of additional microstructural features s such as grain
              boundaries, we may expect additional failure  modes in polysilicon.    4.
              Design test structures to indicate incipient or possible  failure.  These
              structures are meant to be placed with  operating MEMS devices to detect crack
              initiation, permanent  deformation, shock, or changes in structural response.  
               This work is essential to ensure reliable MEMS applications.        ***
