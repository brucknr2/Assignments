Abstract    :
              9408716  Coyne  Support is granted to faculty at the University of California at
               Santa Cruz for continued study of electron-positron interactions  at the
              Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).  The research  aims to determine
              parameters of the standard model of elementary  particles.  The method makes
              use of polarized electrons available  only at the SLC colliding-beams complex
              at SLAC.  The group also  will apply to cosmic-ray detection methods used in
              particle-  physics experiments.  The group participates in the design and 
              construction of MILAGRO, a new air-shower detector that makes use  of Cerenkov
              radiation produced by shower particles in a large  pool of water.  With it they
              will determine properties of cosmic  rays at currently inaccessible energies.
