Abstract    :
              IBN 9408366  Timberlake    The present research attempts to use the concept of
              "behavior systems" to combine the ethological study of "instinctive" behavior
              with laboratory research demonstrating the importance of learning in
              determining purposive behavior.  A "behavior system" refers to stimulus
              filtering, preorganized response components, and motivational states organized
              around a specific function, such as foraging for food.  Dr. Timberlake assumes
              that learning mechanisms evolved to alter behavior within the context of such a
              functional system.  He also assumes that the examples of learning produced by
              familiar laboratory procedures, such as Pavlovian and operant conditioning, can
              be profitably studied within a functional system.  His experiments use prior
              knowledge of the feeding-foraging systems of rats and pigeons to predict the
              form of conditioned responding and the ease of learning under laboratory
              procedures.  At the same time, these experiments use the analytic power of the
              laboratory manipulations to further develop and refine our knowledge of the
              feeding-foraging system.  The experiments focus on characteristics of the
              sequence of motivational states related to foraging:  the control of the
              general search state, as measured by locomotor search of maze environments; the
              control of the focal search state, especially as it relates to the conditioning
              of "superstitious" behavior; and the relation of learned chains of behavior to
              transitions between general and focal search states.  The results should
              clarify the contribution of learning to behavior in both the laboratory and
              natural environments.
