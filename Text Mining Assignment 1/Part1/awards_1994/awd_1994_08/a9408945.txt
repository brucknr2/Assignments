Abstract    :
              9408945  Moran    This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              involves  an opportunistic collaboration between U.S. and Canadian 
              investigators who will conduct a study of a suite of natural and  artificial
              radionuclides during the 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean  Section (AOS).  The AOS
              is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems  Science (ARCSS) Global Change
              Research Program.  The AOS is a  collaborative research effort with Canada that
              will involve  approximately 60 scientists on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker 
              during a 55-day cruise in the summer of 1994.  This project will  measure
              Thorium isotopes in seawater to quantify upper ocean  particulate organic C and
              N export fluxes and deep ocean particle  cycling.  In-situ pumps will be used
              to collect dissolved and  particulate samples for determination of
              radionuclides in the  surface and deep waters.  Collection of these data within
              the  framework of other multidisciplinary efforts will lead to a better 
              understanding of organic C and N cycling, particle dynamics and  circulation
              time scales in the Arctic Ocean, and will contribute to  the emerging global
              efforts to better understand the role of the  Arctic Ocean in global climate
              change.
