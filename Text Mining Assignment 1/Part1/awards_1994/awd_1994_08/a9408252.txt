Abstract    :
              The University of Tennessee seeks support to expand the Chemistry Mass 
              Spectrometry (MS) Center by adding a triple quadrupole electrospray  (ES)
              liquid chromatography (LC)/MS system. ES is needed for expanded  applications,
              particularly those involving characterization of  biochemical systems. The
              instrumentation will also be used for  fundamental studies of solvation and
              other chemical factors affecting  ES sensitivity; and for investigation of the
              mechanism of soluble  polymer size-selective capillary electrophoresis.   
              Since ES spectra are characterized by multiple charging, the proposed  4,000
              mass-to-charge (m/z) range corresponds to a practical mass range  well in
              excess of 105. This constitutes an order-of-magnitude increase  relative to
              current nominal capabilities, and a two order of magnitude  practical
              improvement, in light of the special strengths (including  sub-femtomole
              sensitivity) of ES. The system will accommodate a wide  range of
              chromatographic solvents and flow rates, facilitating work in  microscale and
              conventional analytical separations. The tandem MS  capabilities of the
              instrument will provide structural insight across  the full range of analyte
              compounds, even for individual components of  unresolved or partially resolved
              mixtures.
