Abstract    :
              9408473  Abstract   The long term goal of these studies is to elucidate the
              genetic and  molecular structure of segregation distortion (SD) chromosomes, 
              their mechanism of action and their evolutionary origin. The  immediate aims
              are to (1) molecularly characterize Sd and its  products, (2) isolate and
              analyze null mutations of Sd+, (3)  cytogenetically enolase M(SD), an upward
              modifier of distortion and  Su(SD), a strong X-linked suppressor of distortion.
               %%%  Segregation Distorter (SD) is a naturally occurring meiotic drive  system
              on the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster with the  property that
              heterozygous SD/SD+ males transmit the SD chromosome  to their offspring in
              vast excess over the normal homolog. The  basis of this distorted transmission
              is the dysfunction of  spermatids that receive the SD+ chromosome. Dysfunction
              of these  spermatids is associated with a failure of chromatin condensation  in
              the nuclei but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown.  The long term
              goal of these studies is to elucidate the genetic and  molecular structure of
              SD chromosomes.  ***
