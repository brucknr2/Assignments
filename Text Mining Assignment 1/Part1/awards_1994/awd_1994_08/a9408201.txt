Abstract    :
              9408201  Thompson    The goal of this study is quantitative understanding of the
              origins  and evolution of texture during grain growth in thin films, and the 
              ability to accurately predict grain size and orientation  distributions as a
              function of thermal and process history of  different film/substrate
              combinations.  Experimental and  theoretical research on grain growth and
              texture evolution in  polycrystalline films is focused towards the competitive
              effects on  minimization of the film/substrate interface energy and 
              minimization of strain energy densities.  The research includes the  
              polycrystalline-silver/single-crystal-nickel system, silver/copper,  and a
              number of polycrystalline metallic films on a variety of  silica-coated
              substrates with different thermal expansion  coefficients.  Strain energy is
              controlled through the choice of  substrates and through modifications in
              thermal history.  Known  strains are imposed using 4-point and 3-point bending.
               Texture  evolution is characterized using thin film X-ray diffraction and 
              several electron diffraction techniques.  Grain sizes are  characterized using
              electron and focused ion beam microscopy and  film stresses are monitored by
              measurements of wafer curvature,  both during and after heating and grain
              growth.  A computer program  for simulation of grain growth in thin films will
              be improved to  account for orientation-dependent strain-energy-density 
              differences, in both elastically strained and plastically deformed  films.   
              %%%  This research should improve technology for creating thin films  used in a
              variety of industrial applications.  ***
