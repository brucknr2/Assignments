Abstract    :
              Lin 9408857  The Adaptive Critic Learning (ACL) technique is one self-learning
              technique, which has received much attention form researchers in the recent
              years because of its great potential in solving difficult
              control/decision-making problems.  However when this technique is applied to
              complex planning problems, there are issues of "chunking" which have not
              received sufficient attention in the neuroengineering literature. This project
              will explore the application of ACL on biped walking control, which involves
              multiple control actions (joints) and is a complicated problem.  Two new
              advanced structures, both based on ACL,  will be explored.  These structures
              have either leveled critics or a combination of critic with other adaption
              capability at different levels.  The Hierarchical structures are expected to be
              more suitable for complicated problems.  This study also intends to find out
              possible roadblocks in advanced ACL applications.   In addition to the
              technical aspect, this study will take a closer look at the relationship
              between ACL and Human learning process.
