Abstract    :
              9408342  Hopkins    Crustaceans regenerate new walking legs when old ones are 
              lost or injured.  Ecdysteroids (the invertebrate steroid  hormones) which
              control growth in virtually all arthropods  also influence the special kind of
              growth involved in  regeneration.  The research proposed here will investigate 
              the role of these steroids in leg regeneration in the crab,  Uca pugilator. 
              Since regeneration in crabs involves both  cellular differentiation and
              anabolic activities, this  research will yield new insights into the molecular
              controls  of these two very different events.  Using our recently  isolated DNA
              probe for the ecdysteroid receptor, Dr. Hopkins  will look at the patterns of
              receptor expression during  regeneration and the structural/functional
              relationships  between steroid hormones, other growth-affecting compounds 
              (such as the retinoids), and their receptors.  Because  steroid receptors of
              invertebrates are so similar to those  of higher vertebrates, the data
              generated by this research  should provide a better understanding of how
              steroids, in  general, control and coordinate the complicated phenomena of 
              growth.  ***
