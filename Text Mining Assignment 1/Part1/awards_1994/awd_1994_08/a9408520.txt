Abstract    :
              9408520  Kroodsma                                Abstract    Human language is
              an outstanding example of animal communication.  Another outstanding example is
              the evolution of vocal learning  that has led to remarkable and complex vocal
              behaviors among  songbirds.  Dr. Kroodsma will study the relationship between 
              vocal learning and various features of natural history, such as  nesting,
              habitat selection and adult singing in a group that  lives in a variety of
              habitats from Canada to Tierra del Fuego.  The results of observational field
              studies and laboratory  experiments in several species will help to unravel the
               ecological and social forces that contribute to the evolution of  vocal
              learning.  In the long run, these studies will make an  important contribution
              towards understanding the basic biological  principles and mechanisms
              underlying the evolution of animal  communication.
