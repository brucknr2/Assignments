Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9408946  Pfeffer - NJIT    It is proposed to explore the use of
              a rotating centrifugal bed filter with a "self cleaning" zeolite catalyst for
              removal of soot and NOx from the exhaust of internal combustion engines.  Its
              application for reducing air pollution from mobile Diesel engines will also be
              tested.    The rotating fluidized bed as a dust filter with variable speed was
              proposed by the PI.  A preliminary test for a "self cleaning" zeolite catalyst
              has been performed in the University of Tokyo, by a collaborator of the PI.  At
              695 degrees Kelvin, the soot and NOx interacted successively with the fluidized
              bed composed of a copper ion-exchange ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst, resulting in
              emissions of N2 and CO2 and a continuous regeneration of the original catalyst.
               This project aims to verify the "self cleanliness" of several particulate
              catalysts, their range of application, and the time scales over which the
              catalysts would remain active.  If the preliminary study is positive, a
              fluidized bed device will be engineered for direct attachment to a mobile
              Diesel-powered vehicle and tested in situ with the objective of reducing air
              pollution.    If successful, the research may lead to a versatile filter for
              the internal combustion engines, with improved performances as compared to
              existing systems for a variety of applications in environmental technology.
