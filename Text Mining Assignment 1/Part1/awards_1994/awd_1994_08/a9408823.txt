Abstract    :
              9408823  Howell           ABSTRACT    Introduction to Computer Integrated
              Manufacturing into Freshman Engineering Curriculum    Northern Arizona
              University (NAU) will acquire CNC desktop milling machines to use in its
              freshman engineering curriculum with Autodesk providing software for the
              machines.  NAU is a minority institution, located near several large Indian
              reservations, whose undergraduates include larege numbers of American Indian
              and Hispanic students.  The NAU will use this project as one way to create
              student interest in manufacturing and increase the retention rate of
              engineering students by providing an opportunity to use a modern CNC system. 
              The milling machines and associated hardware and software will also be used in
              advanced design courses.  ***
