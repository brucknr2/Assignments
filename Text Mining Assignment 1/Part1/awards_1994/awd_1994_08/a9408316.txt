Abstract    :
              9408316  Good   The collection of amphibians and reptiles in the Louisiana State
              Universitiy Museum of Natural Science currently contains approximately 56,000
              specimens and is recognized internationally as a significant research resource
              largely because of its important neotropical holdings and because of its
              particular strength in snake skeletal and hemipenial material.  Funds will
              permit movement of two "orphaned" collections, from the University of
              Southwestern Louisiana and Southeastern Louisiana Universitiy, totaling some
              21,300 specimens to LSU Museum of Natural Science.  This will result in a 38%
              increase in the overall size of the LSU collection.  Incorporation of this new
              material will involve cataloguing and installing the specimens, entering their
              ancillary data into the Museum's computer database system, and checking the
              database for accuracy against the individual specimen tags.  Funds will also
              support several non recurring needs resulting from the acquisition of these
              specimens, including the purchase and installation of additional shelving to
              house the influx of new specimens and temporary support for a collection
              manager to handle this new material.
