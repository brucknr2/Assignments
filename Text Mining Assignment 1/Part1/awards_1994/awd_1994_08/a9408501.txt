Abstract    :
              Roth  9408501    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative  research
              project between Dr. Monica Roth, Robert Wood  Johnson Medical School, New
              Jersey, and Dr. Oscar Leon,  Universidad Austral de Chile.  They propose to use
              chemical  cross-linking methods to study the interaction between  retroviral
              RNase H and tRNA to determine which regions of  the protein are at or near
              specific sites of the RNA-DNA  hybrid substrate. This approach will also help
              to pinpoint  amino acid sides chains that may be important for its  function. 
              For this purpose, RNA-DNA hybrid substrates of  RNase H will be synthesized and
              modified at specific sites  by the introduction of reactive groups.    The
              studies are of mutual benefits for both laboratories  involved and require a
              combination of the complementary  skills of both researchers.  Ongoing studies
              by Dr. Roth  apply biochemical approaches to understand the mechanism of  tRNA
              release by the RNase H activity and reverses  transcriptase, while Dr. Leon's
              expertise is in chemical  cross-linking of proteins and tRNA.  The results of
              the  studies are expected to contribute to the field of protein-  nucleic acid
              recognition.  Current procedures to be adapted  for the specific application to
              RNA/DNA hybrids may be  applicable to other similar systems.    ***
