Abstract    :
              9408228  Harvell    Plants, and colonial animals such as corals and bryozoans, 
              are termed modular organisms because they are constructed of  iterated units.
              Although it is understood how materials are  transported among the units of
              plants, this process is  poorly known in colonial animals, where the transport
              moves  resources among units that show division of labor between  feeding,
              reproduction and defense. This study examines  whether the amounts and rates at
              which materials are moved  among the units constrain performance. In the marine
               bryozoan Membranipora membranacea, defensive units are  induced by the
              proximity of predators and competitors. The  construction of defensive units
              slows growth and this  research will investigate whether construction of the 
              defensive units also changes transport of a radioisotpoic  marker in the
              colony. Although costs of defense are widely  cited as a limitation on the
              types of defenses organisms  deploy, in no organism has the mechanism
              underlying the cost  been demonstrated.  ***
