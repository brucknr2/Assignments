Abstract    :
              9408771  Frank  Analysis of the natural abundance of stable isotopes has
              recently emerged as a powerful tool to understand complex ecological processes.
               the simple elegance of the technique stems from relatively easy and
              inexpensive measurements of naturally occurring stable isotopes providing
              information on the origin and key chemical transformations of organic matter. 
              Here I will apply the method to study the effect of large herbivores on rates
              of gaseous nitrogen loss via denitrification and ammonia volatilization.    In
              Yellowstone National Park, large herbivores (elk and bison) increase the
              abundance of 15N, a rare nitrogen isotope, relative to 14N, the most abundant
              isotope, in a dominant grass species.  This finding, in addition to an
              understanding of how herbivores impact nitrogen cycling and during which
              transformations the isotopic composition of nitrogen is altered, suggests that
              analysis of nitrogen isotopes may provide information on the effect of
              herbivores on rates of denitrification and ammonia loss, two processes that are
              currently labor intensive, expensive, and problematic to measure.  The goals of
              the study are to further describe the influence of large herbivores on the
              nitrogen isotope composition of grazed grassland, and examine the mechanisms
              responsible for this isotopic response to herbivores.  Specific objectives are:
              (1) measure isotopic composition of soil and several dominant plant species in
              Yellowstone National Park, (2) measure the effect of herbivores on rates of
              denitrification and ammonia volatilization in Yellowstone, and (3) determine
              the effect of herbivore urine and dung amendments on the isotopic composition
              of soil and plants.      Large herbivores have many indirect effects on
              nitrogen cycling that go well beyond their direct removal of plant material. 
              Since up to 50% of the Earth's terrestrial surface is rangeland, including
              grassland, savanna, and open woodland that support grazing mammals, grazers may
              have a profound effect on the global nitrogen  budget.  This study will examine
              the long-term effects of herbivores on gaseous nitrogen loss from grazed
              habitat, and the applicability of using 15N abundance to study nitrogen cycling
              in terrestrial ecosystems.
