Abstract    :
              9408896  Ostendorf       This is a standard award made as an extension to the
              research  conducted under IRI-8902124 and is funded under ARPA's program 
              competition for the Augmentation Awards for Science and Engineering  Research
              Training.  The research proposed investigates model-based  approaches or the
              representation of channel noise and distortion  via cepstrum and parametric
              transformations, involving one graduate  and one undergraduate student
              following research topic stimulated  by the previous award.  Graduate student
              research under this award  considers a segmental model approach to model-based
              channel  compensation using parallel HMMs and maximum likelihood channel 
              identification of both additive and convolutional noise.  The  undergraduate
              research topic involves the evaluation of signal  processing approaches for
              noise and channel compensation as they  compare with more classical approaches
              that use standard Melwarped  cepstra and derivative features.  Both of these
              projects complement  the objective of the original award and augment it.
