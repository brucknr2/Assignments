Abstract    :
              9408649  Lucas         For the first time since explicitly dynamic macroeconomic
               models were first developed in the 1930s, we have available a  class of
              theories that are squarely in the general equilibrium  tradition; built up from
              assumptions on preferences, technology,  and market structure.  In the ten
              years since the introduction of  the first real business cycle model, a great
              deal of useful  theoretical and computational experience has been accumulated, 
              evidence from a wide range of sources has been brought to bear on  key
              parameters, and people have begun to apply the standard  methods of
              neoclassical welfare analysis to macroeconomic  questions.  These are exciting
              and promising technical  developments, but they have been bound together with a
              particular  substantive view of the nature of business cycles: that 
              productivity changes have been the main source of economic  instability.  As a
              result, macroeconomists who are convinced of  the importance of monetary shocks
              and nominal rigidities have  made little use of these developments.  This
              project addresses  the question of how to best integrate the analysis of real
              and  monetary forces in a general equilibrium framework with well-  specified
              microfoundations.         This project pursues theoretical research on the
              business  cycle effects of monetary instability.  A framework is proposed  for
              a unified treatment of the economy's response to productivity  shocks and of
              market malfunctions that transmit monetary  disturbances in other sectors of
              the economy.  The potential of  this framework in accounting for the behavior
              of production,  prices, and interest rates is described,  Some central
              questions  are identified, and a program of theoretical, numerical, and 
              empirical research on these question is pursued.
