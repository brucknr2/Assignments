Abstract    :
              Morgan  9408951    The inability of investigators to track microscopic larvae 
              of marine animals has impeded our understanding of  planktonic processes that
              regulate larval supply to adult  populations.  This project will be to adapt
              techniques that  have been used by entomologists to study dispersal by 
              crustacean larvae.  The study will determine the feasibility  of tagging
              barnacle and crab larvae with rare earth elements  (REE) by examining uptake
              and persistence of marker, levels  of marker passed from females to larvae and
              variability of  rare earth elements in larvae from natural populations.  The 
              success of adapting this technique for marine animals  largely  depends on
              whether or not REEs can be accumulated  and retained by animals in seawater
              long enough to be useful  as tracers of larval movements.    ***
