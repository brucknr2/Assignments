Abstract    :
              9408980  Gladysz  Univ. of Utah  Dr. John Gladysz, Chemistry Department,
              University of Utah, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program to develop the organometallic chemistry of Re
              to provide new methods of asymmetric synthesis and routes to long , linear
              chains containing only carbon atoms. In the first of  these projects a highly
              diastereoselective  2,3  sigmatropic rearrangement of chiral rhenium
              sulfur-ylide compounds will be used to thio-derivatives in high enantiomeric
              purity. In the second portion, acetylenic fragments, in which one end is
              attached to an organorhenium moiety, will be oxidatively coupled to form linear
              carbon chains which are 4, 8, 9, and 16 atoms long. The mechanisms of the
              various reactions and delocalization of unpaired electrons within the carbon
              chains will be studied.  Many molecules exist in two mirror image forms which
              are not the same (similar to right and left handed gloves). Many biologically 
              important molecules are of this type and often the two mirror image form have
              very different properties. Consequently, the ability to selectively form a
              single form is of great importance to, e.g., the pharmaceutical and
              agrichemical industries. In this project a new method of accomplishing some
              highly selective syntheses of important sulfur containing compounds will be
              developed. In a second part of the study long chains of composed only of carbon
              atoms will be prepared. These are of interest because of they may form the
              basis of electrically conducting, wire-like molecules.
