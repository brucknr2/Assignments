Abstract    :
                       B. Holly Smith  SBR- 9408408    A comparison of the pattern of human
              development with that  of other primates and mammals shows that our "life
              history"  is particulary extreme, characterized by prolonged juvenile 
              development, long life, extremely helpless infants, and a  short duration of
              breast feeding, among other features.  Classic work in primatology suggests
              that the dentition is  closely adated to growth rate and other life cycle 
              characteristics.  This research project will, by  establishing a large
              comparative data set on the development  of the teeth in primates and other
              mammals, establish a  framework that will allow the retrieval of the evolution
              of  life history descriptions from the fossil record.  Research  will
              investigate how the state of the dentition at birth,  sequence and age of tooth
              emergence, are related to  precosity of the young at birth, age of weaning,
              overall  growth rate in sepcies, and so on.  It is a novel and  important
              approach to old questions.      P\anthro\jfried\9408408.abs
