Abstract    :
              9408623  Jim Chen       This project addresses both modelling and
              experimentation to   investigate a modified single roll caster using the
              concept of   "Intelligent Processing of Materials".  Such a study will also
              lead   to the advancement of similar technology, melt spinning, which is  
              known as a rapid solidification process (RSP).  The materials   produced by RSP
              possess refined and homogeneous microstructures   and much improved physical,
              magnetic, and mechanical properties.    Building on prior work of simulating
              hot rolling process, this  project on single roll casting of thin strips has
              the process  potential to reduce the energy consumption and manufacturing cost 
              by more than 50% as compared with the  conventional steel making  where several
              process steps are involved including casting, rolling  and heat treating.   The
              study will include the development of (1)  macro-scale modeling for predicting
              the melt flow and  solidification phenomena as well as predicting the ribbon
              geometry,  (2) experimental investigation of interface heat transfer and 
              solidification behavior, and (3) model validation and process  optimization.   
                 Primary metals processing technology has been moving towards   direct
              casting of thinner and thinner cross sections.  Initially,   the process step
              between ingot casting and hot rolling was   eliminated by the development of
              direct, one step, continuous slab   casting.  The next step of eliminating slab
              casting followed by   rolling by a single step, continuous strip casting
              remains a   technical challenge, particularly for higher melting metals such as
                steel.  Successful completion of this project has the potential to  
              revolutionize the way thin strips of metals are manufactured at   substantially
              reduced cost with a low capital investment.
