Abstract    :
              9408470  Dietrich  The project will document the response to winter rainfall in
              the  areas of the recent wildfires in Southern California.  The  topography,
              geology and climate of these sites will cause the  erosional response to be
              large and costly as in previous  wildfires like the 1991 Oakland firestorm. 
              The objective of the  work is to determine the appropriate mitigation measures
              to be  used after these events which occur in this region almost every  year. 
              In addition to the broad documentation of the erosional  response to the fire,
              the project will collect field evidence on  the effectiveness of the erosion
              control measures taken, and will  use this data to guide and evaluate a digital
              terrain model for  predicting landscape response to fire.  This knowledge will 
              improve the understanding of the erosional process and the  quality of the
              mitigation measures to be taken.  ***
