Abstract    :
              9408057  Chapman       Molecular data from nuclear and organellar DNA, in
              conjunction  with numerical algorithms for phylogenetic analysis, have 
              revolutionized the study of plant evolution.  Dr. Russell Chapman  of Louisiana
              State University has been a leader in the application  of these molecular and
              taxometric methodologies to the analysis of  green algae and of so-called lower
              land plants such as mosses and  club-mosses.  Focussing primarily on nuclear
              ribosomal gene  sequences, he has shown that the bryophytes (mosses,
              liverworts,  and hornworts), while likely to be the earliest diverging lineages
               of land plants, are themselves not a single evolutionary unit but  a series of
              terrestrial "experiments."  Additional DNA data are  being collected to test
              the phylogenetic affinities of various  bryophyte groups, and in particular to
              assess the utility of the  current classification of mosses into 17 distinct
              suborders.  As  samples become available, molecular analyses will also be
              applied  to related groups of primitive vascular plants, the lycophytes  (club
              mosses and relatives).       In association with morphological and
              ultrastructural studies  underway in other laboratories, the molecular
              phylogenetic analyses  of nuclear ribosomal DNA conducted by Dr. Chapman are
              providing  insight to the direction and tempo of change in plants as they 
              adapted to life on land.
