Abstract    :
              9408816  Lin    Technical abstract:  It is proposed to investigate the nature of
               Anderson localization in II-VI semiconductor alloys.  In the alloys  the
              lifetime of a photogenerated electron-hole pair, or exciton,  near the mobility
              edge is directly correlated to its localization  length.  Thus the exciton
              system in these materials represents a  model system for studying quantum
              localization.  The dynamics of  exciton localization will be probed by time
              resolved  photoluminescence spectroscopy.  The exciton localization length, 
              mobility edge, and the critical exponent of the localization length  will be
              measured under different conditions including temperature  and the degree of
              alloy disorder.  The universality of the critical  exponent and the fundamental
              differences between charge carrier  localization and exciton localization will
              be investigated.  These  studies can provide new insight into the physics
              quantum  localization.    Non-technical abstract:  Disorder in solids can cause
              a remarkable  effect that is the spatial localization of electronic charge,
              which  is called Anderson localization.  Since dome degree of disorder is  a
              nearly universal feature of real materials, the Anderson  localization is
              likewise a ubiquitous ingredient in determining  electrical, optical, and other
              physical properties of condensed  matter.  Therefore, Anderson localization is
              recognized as one of  the most important subjects in condensed matter physics. 
              This  proposed research is to study the properties of Anderson  localization in
              certain semiconductor alloys (containing elements  from groups II and VI of the
              periodic table) which have important  applications in optoelectronic devices.
