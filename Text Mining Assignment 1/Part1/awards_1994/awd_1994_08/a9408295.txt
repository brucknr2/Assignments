Abstract    :
              9408295  Pascal  Three projects will be studied: (1) the use of nonplanar  
              aromatic compounds as conformational switches, (2) the use   of
              nitrogen-halogen donor-acceptor interactions in aromatic   compounds, sometimes
              in combination with hydrogen bonds, for   the control of molecular conformation
              and molecular   association in the solid state and in solution, and (3) the  
              synthesis of conformationally rigid, chiral molecular   cavities.     This
              grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing research of
              Professor Robert A. Pascal, Jr. at   Princeton University. Molecules will be
              prepared that will   change their three-dimensional array in a controlled
              manner   upon oxidation or reduction (the gain or loss of an   electron) and by
              changing acidity. These molecules will form   the basis of molecular switches,
              which may have practical   importance. Another aspect of the work will directed
              to a   study of attractive interactions between nitrogen and   chlorine atoms
              in molecules. These interactions will have   importance in the controlled
              assembly of molecules in   solution and the solid-phase. In the final project,
              chiral   molecular cavities will be prepared which can act as hosts   to other
              chiral guest molecules. Chiral molecules are   related as one's right and left
              hand.
