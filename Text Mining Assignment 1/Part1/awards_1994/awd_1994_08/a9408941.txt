Abstract    :
              9408941  Hobbs       With this award, Dr. Hobbs will attempt to quantify the
              effects of aerosols on climate  through their effects on clouds through a
              series of airborne observations.  Measurements will  be obtained of key
              parameters for a variety of aerosols, for various cloud types, and in several 
              climatological regimes.  The measurements include cloud condensation nucleus
              (CCN)  efficiencies (i.e., the number of CCN produced by unit mass of a
              chemical species) of various  types of atmospheric aerosols, the effects of
              these aerosols on cloud droplet concentrations and  size distributions and the
              radiative properties of clouds (particularly near cloud tops).  The 
              measurements will be made in strongly polluted air in the northeastern United
              States, in the  smoke produced by biomass burning in the Amazon Basin, and in
              moderately polluted as well  as quite clear air in the Pacific Northwest and
              Alaska.         This project will contribute to a better understanding of
              climate processes and the  potential for global climate change.  It is being
              funded under the Role of Clouds, Energy, and  Water in Global Climate Change
              Research Opportunity.  ***
