Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
              help the  Department of Chemistry at the CUNY-Queens College acquire a 400 MHz
              spectrometer which  will be used in the following research investigations:  (1)
               The Interactions of Azaheterocycles  and Their Metal Complexes with Nucleic
              Acids; (2)  Natural Products Synthesis; (3)  Synthesis of Lipid Analogs for Use
              in Studies of Lipid-Lipid Interactions in Membranes;  (4)  Stereochemical
              Effects in Transition Metal Ion Centered Dendrimers; (5)  Mechanism  and Design
              in Organometallic Chemistry; and (6)  Synthesis and NMR of Labelled Amino 
              Acids, Peptides, and Nucleoside Analogs.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
