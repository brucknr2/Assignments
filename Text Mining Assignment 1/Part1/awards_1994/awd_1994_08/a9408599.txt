Abstract    :
              Over the past several years, Stevens Institute of Technology  has constructed a
              modern centralized facility for  microstructural characterization. Matching
              funds are  provided to the Institute to purchase a field-emission  scanning
              electron microscope. With this instrument,  approximately 50 graduate students
              10 faculty at the  Institute can attack research problems that they could not 
              address previously. A significant fraction of materials  research at the
              Institute concentrates on ceramics and  polymers. Some current problems are the
              synthesis of  nanocrystalline silicon carbide whiskers, the tribological 
              properties of silicon nitrides and the interphase structure  in
              fiber-reinforced polymer composites and in polymer  blends. These involve 3-D
              structures where information  gathered by imaging surfaces using scanning
              electron  microscopy is essential. Because they are poor electrical 
              conductors, however, ceramics and polymers do not lend  themselves well to
              high-resolution electron-optical imaging.  Morphological information is limited
              by artifactual  structure introduced by conductive specimen coatings.  Problems
              associated with specimen charging can be  significantly ameliorated, however,
              with a field-emission  electron-optical system. A field-emission source has a 
              brightness several orders of magnitude greater than  traditional thermionic
              sources and a smaller incident  electron energy spread. These features enable
              SEM imaging of  uncoated specimens at low accelerating voltages (-lkeV)  while
              preserving very good resolution (approx. 4 nm). At  higher voltages (approx. 30
              keV) the resolution can be as  high as l nm.
