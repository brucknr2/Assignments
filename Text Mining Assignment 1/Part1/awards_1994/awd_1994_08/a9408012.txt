Abstract    :
              9408012  Goetz    Ovulation is the release of a mature egg from its enclosure 
              in the ovary.  Progestational steroids have been implicated  in the control of
              ovulation but little is known about their  specific role in this process.  The
              objective of this  proposal is to determine what these steroids are 
              specifically stimulating in the ovary at the time of  ovulation.  To accomplish
              this, a fish model, the yellow  perch, will be used.  The reason for using this
              model is  that research on perch has already demonstrated that  ovulation is
              regulated by a progestational steroid and that  the regulation requires the
              activation of genes and the  synthesis of new protein.  When a gene is
              activated in a  cell, a specific message (called messenger RNA; mRNA) is 
              created that acts as a template for protein synthesis.  In  the present study,
              the mRNAs that are stimulated by the  progestational steroid during ovulation
              will be isolated  using molecular biological techniques and their biochemical 
              sequences determined.  These sequences will be compared to  those of known
              proteins that are maintained in the national  GenBank database.  Through these
              comparisons an initial idea  of what the steroid is specifically stimulating at
              the time  of ovulation can be obtained.  ***
