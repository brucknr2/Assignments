Abstract    :
              This two-year standard grant, supported by the Chemistry and Molecular   and
              Cellular Biosciences Divisions, facilitates investigations into the   structure
              of enzymes that have been modified with polyethylene glycol.    Spectroscopic
              studies, including circular dichroism, uv-visible, and   electron spin
              resonance will be used to characterize the structure of the   modified enzymes
              as they exist in organic solvents.  Horseradish   peroxidase, and the related
              enzyme, cytochrome P 450, will be the focus   of these investigations.  These
              studies should permit the   characterization of enzyme intermediates that are
              not easily studied in   aqueous environments, due to their extremely short
              lifetimes, and will   allow enzymes to be used for targeted synthesis in
              organic solvents.    Professor Mabrouk and her students will characterize the
              structure of   enzymes that have been modified with polymers, which allow for  
              stabilization of these species in organic solvents.   One of the enzymes   to
              be characterized in this study, cytochrome P 450, is an important   partner in
              the biochemical pathway for conversion of oxygen to carbon   dioxide. The
              implications of this research include the ability to   characterize normally
              inaccessible intermediate structures, and the   development of viable
              commercial catalysis methods based on enzyme   chemistry.
