Abstract    :
              IBN-9408022  Killeen                                              Abstract    It
              is indisputable that rewards and punishments change behavior,   but less
              certain is just what behavior they affect; just how is   "credit" (or blame)
              allocated to the stream of prior behavior?    Dr. Killeen posits that in order
              to be reinforceable, a behavior   (response) must be in short-term memory (STM)
              along with the   incentive that rewards it.  Because this memory fades over
              time,   more than just the most recent response is reinforceable; the   effects
              of a reward impinge on the previous stream of behavior,   with decreasing
              efficacy as the response-memories age.  Dr.   Killeen's research will define
              the shape and extent of this   response STM by a "resonance" technique in which
              the correct   characterization of the memory window is signaled by a maximum in
                learning rate.    There are many implications of this theory and its
              perspective:    It changes our understanding of how reinforcement schedules  
              affect behavior, provides a new model for temporal effects in   classical
              conditioning, reopens questions of chunking and   automatization, clarifies how
              incentives may at the same time   reinforce a response and erase memory of that
              response, and   provides a new approach to the classic problem of response
              units.    The results of the research should help to significantly improve  
              training techniques; provide independent indices of memory,   motivation, and
              response facility; and reduce the plethora of   scheduling techniques to a
              concise and predictive mathematical   system.
