Abstract    :
              This dissertation grant is for research to analyze the influence  of women in
              supervisory positions on the attainment of the  individuals they supervise. 
              The first part of the study focuses  on the impact of female faculty on the
              educational and labor  market success of female students.  Data from the
              National  Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1973 and the High 
              School and Beyond sophomore cohort will be utilized for the  analysis. 
              Statistical analysis of the these data will shed light  on the issue of whether
              there is a positive role model effect of  female faculty on women's education
              and success in the labor  market.  The second part of the project analyzes the
              effects of  supervisor gender on male and female employees using the concept 
              of compensating wage differentials.  The major data source is the  National
              Longitudinal Survey Youth Cohort.   Of special interest  is whether there is a
              mentoring effect for women having a female  supervisor.  This research is
              important because it will shed  light on the importance of role models and
              mentors in reducing  educational and labor force attainments differences
              between men  and women.
