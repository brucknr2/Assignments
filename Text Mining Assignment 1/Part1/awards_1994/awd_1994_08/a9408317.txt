Abstract    :
              9408317  Brown   Differences in gene regulation in natural populations of
              organisms may serve as the most important source of genetic variation for the
              process of natural selection.  The purpose of the proposed research is to
              investigate one of the molecular aspects of gene regulation, namely gene
              transcription, in response to positive selection, neutral mutation, and
              purifying selection.  In a glucose-limited environment, genes engaged in
              glucose metabolism are under strong selection, and the genes for galactose
              metabolism are not used.  Positive selection for enhanced glucose utilization
              may lead to increased activity of genes involved in galactose metabolism
              leading to the loss of galactose inducibility in these genes.  In this
              environment, the sole nitrogen source is ammonium sulfate, and yeast must
              metabolize all amino acids.  Genes for amino acid metabolism are critically
              important for cell growth, and their regulation is subject to purifying
              selection.  The first objective of the proposed work is to assess the effect of
              positive selection on transcriptional regulation of genes whose products are
              involved in glucose metabolism; the effect of neutral mutations on the
              inducibility of genes whose products are involved in galactose metabolism, and
              the effect of purifying selection on the transcriptional regulation of genes
              involved in amino acid synthesis.  The second objective is to determine whether
              nucleotide sequence differences in the promoter regions of genes may account
              for the transcriptional differences.
