              Abstract  ATM-9408711  Prentice, Michael L.  University of Maine  Title: New
              Guinea Glacier Fluctuations Between 20 and 10Ka    This SGER Award supports a
              reconnaissance study of tropical glacier  fluctuations in western New Guinea
              (Irian Jaya) during the last  glacial-interglacial transition from 20 to 10Ka. 
              The study will  emphasize radiocarbon chronology.  The project has four
              objectives:  (1) topographic mapping, (2) glacier reconstruction, (3) 
              chronology, and (4) linkage to ice-modeling and vegetation studies.   The
              principal field area will be the Kemabu plateau a tableland  north of the
              highest mountain on New Guinea, Mt. Jaya (4884 m).   This is an exploratory
              proposal, logistical operations in the  remote Irian Jaya highlands are quite
              difficult and the potential  of obtaining suitable material for radiocarbon
              dating is unknown.    Irian Jaya is adjacent to the tropical western Pacific
              "warm pool,"  the warmest region on the planet.  The Irian Jaya glacial record 
              should closely reflect the average temperature variability of the  warm-pool
              region.  Because the temperature of the warm-pool region  exerts a dominant
              influence on the tropical water-vapor "fountain,"  the Irian Jaya glacial
              record also monitors the water-vapor content  of the global atmosphere.
