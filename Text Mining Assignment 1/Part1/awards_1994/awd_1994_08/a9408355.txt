Abstract    :
              9408355  Theriot    The Academy of Natural Sciences will computerize the
              taxonomic determinations for all accessioned slides in the Academy of Natural
              Sciences of Philadelphia Diatom Herbarium (ca. 184,000 entries).  This will
              take approximately 1.4 years requiring 2.0 FTE of which the Academy will supply
              0.6 FTE for computer LAN management, supervision of data entry personnel,
              verification of entries, taxonomic determinations and nomenclatural upgrades. 
              The requested funding for 1.4 FTE is for data entry.  The material will be used
              in the development of an ecological database in coordination with ecologists at
              ANSP.  There is a growing need within the diatomist community to construct and
              analyze large databases in order to address larger problems of cultural and
              natural effects on the environment.  There are no published standards for
              aquatic environmental databases.
