Abstract    :
                  9408186  NEWTON    The project is about the interaction of protein kinase C
              with phosphatidyl serine and diacylglycerol.  Results of studies with several 
              protein kinase C isozymes have already been published.  These studies will
              build on this information and use modeling based on crystal structures to
              predict sites of interaction for the lipids.  The critical experiments involve
              expressing mutated forms of protein kinase C in a bacculovirus system and using
              the proteins to measure affinities for the ligands.  The regulation of protein
              C isoforms is a very important mechanism for regulating signal transduction. 
              %%%  Cells are known to respond to a variety of extracellular signals by
              altering the activity of a key enzyme known as protein kinase C.  This enzyme
              is in turn regulated by interactions with lipids.  This is the first known link
              between lipids and intracellular regulation.  The ability of different forms of
              protein kinase C to interact with different lipids seems to be a key aspect of
              regulating how a cell responds to a particular stimulus.  This project will
              accomplish a detailed biochemical analysis of the strength of interaction
              between normal and mutant forms of the enzyme and various lipids.  The use of
              recombinant DNA to mutate and express the genes for protein kinase C is a key
              aspect of the project.  ***
