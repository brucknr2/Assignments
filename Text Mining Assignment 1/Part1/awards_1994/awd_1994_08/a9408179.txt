Abstract    :
              DeSilva       This project will study the production of NOx in natural 
              lightning by means of laboratory discharges with parameters similar  to
              atmospheric lightning, using an existing apparatus equipped with  a large array
              of diagnostics.  The procedure will be to compare  experimental measurements of
              densities, temperatures, emitted  radiation, and NOx concentration with a
              time-dependent numerical  simulation which includes the fluid dynamic
              expansion, the  resulting shock wave, the ionization rate equations and the 
              chemical rate equations for relevant reactions.  Initial results  from the
              simulation show that the amount on NO produced per Joule  (P) depends on the
              energy density in the core and on the ambient  pressure.  First year funds will
              be used to initiate the  experimental program in order to verify the core
              energy density and  ambient pressure dependence of P and to improve the
              computer  simulation code.  In succeeding years, the effects that influence 
              the core radius, energy deposition, and hence energy density will  be
              investigated.
