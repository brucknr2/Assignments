Abstract    :
              9408903  Ruskai       Several problems in the mathematical analysis of 
              multi-particle systems will be studied. The main emphasis is on  bound states
              of atomic and molecular Hamiltonians, including  those for systems in magnetic
              fields. The use of radial wavelets  for multi-scale analysis of the Coulumb
              singularity will also be  considered. Finally, some related problems in 
              operatorinequalities are proposed.       Modern physics, quantum mechanics and
              relativity, is  aproduct of the twentieth century. It is founded firmly in the 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter  and to come to
              grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,  electro-magnetism, and heat
              radiation. The  mathematical foundations for these developments, collectively 
              called mathematical physics, ranges from the detailed analysis  of Schroedinger
              operators, which governs the dynamics of  particles, to unified field theory,
              which attempts to unite the  four known forces into a single theory.  ***
