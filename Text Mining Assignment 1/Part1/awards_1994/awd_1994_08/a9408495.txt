Abstract    :
              9408495  Taylor  The Solid State Science Committee (SSSC) proposes to continue
              its  effort to monitor the health of the field of materials science in  the
              United States.  The committee will prepare a forum on  processing and
              manufacturing of advanced materials.  It will assess  the progress that might
              be achieved with the new generation of free  electron lasers jointly with the
              Board on Chemical Sciences and  Technology.  The SSSC will monitor and provide
              assistance on  photonics and optical materials to the Board on Physics and 
              Astronomy and the National Materials Advisory Board on a study on  optical
              sciences and engineering.  %%%  The Solid State Science Committee (SSSC)
