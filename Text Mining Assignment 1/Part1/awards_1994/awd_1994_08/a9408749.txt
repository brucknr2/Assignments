Abstract    :
              9408749  Latanision    Many   glassy   and   crystalline  solids   produced   by
                rapid  solidification  processing have remarkable mechanical,  magnetic,  and
               electrical  properties  and,  accordingly,  great  potential  commercial  
              utility.   Without   chemical   stability   in   the  environments  to  which 
              these alloys may  be  exposed  while  in  service,  however, their unusual
              properties may  be  lost.   Some  metallic  glasses  are  more  inert  compared
               to  conventionally  processed  alloys.  The objective of the current research 
              is  to  examine the corrosion resistance of such alloys and to develop  a 
              fundamental  basis  for understanding their behavior.   Corrosion  behavior of
              the neodymium-iron-boron alloy system is explored  in  alkaline environments. 
              Its susceptibility to hydrogen damage  is  examined  when coupled to zinc in
              neutral sulfates and chlorides.  Transmission  electron  microscopy foils are 
              employed  to  study  preferential dissolution in this system.  Results of the
              research  should provide information for improving the corrosion resistance  of
                these  magnetically  interesting  rapidly-solidified  alloys  without
              compromising their magnetic properties. %%%  This corrosion research program
              will provide information  for the  protection  of rapidly solidified alloys
              which have  industrially  useful  magnetic  properties,  but  lack  chemical 
              stability  at  service environments.  ***
