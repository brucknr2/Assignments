Abstract    :
              9408029  Bach     This project will investigate the effects of insect herbivory
              and abiotic disturbance on rates and patterns of primary succession on sand
              dunes, with emphasis on the colonizing plant Salix cordata and the specialist
              folivorous beetle Altica subplicata.  This project will examine the effect of
              sand burial and flooding (two natural disturbances) on Salix performance and
              plant succession, and the interaction between herbivory and disturbance in
              influencing sand-dune succession.      There has been only limited study of the
              interactive effects of disturbance and herbivory on succession, yet such
              interactions may have major influences on the course of community change.  All
              biological communities are in a state of successional change.  Understanding
              the mechanisms that drive this change will improve our ability to manage
              altered ecosystems and biological preserves, promote ecosystem recovery, and
              mitigate the loss of biological diversity.
