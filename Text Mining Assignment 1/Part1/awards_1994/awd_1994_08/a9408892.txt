Abstract    :
              9408892  MIXCO                                 ABSTRACT         Mandan is an
              endangered language (with fewer than twelve  speakers, aged seventy or above.)
              The sole member of its own branch of  Siouan, it has conservative features (and
              innovations) crucial for the  understanding of the evolution of its family. No
              published modern  grammar, dictionary or collection of texts exists for the
              language.  This is a project of research to publish a grammar (with a revised 
              phonology superseding previous treatments and a syntax) with a  dictionary
              (7,000 entries) based on linguistic research by Mauricio J.  Mixco. These
              reference works will serve the needs of scholars and the  Mandan community.    
                The focus of the first stage of work will be on phonology and  syntax. Mixco
              will address unresolved phonological problems (namely:  stress, vocal length
              and nasalization.) He will also collect new  syntactic data and retranscribe a
              number of selected texts and other  unpublished data.       Mandan has a
              complex morphology and syntax. Its intransitive  verbs may split into "active"
              and "stative" types with interesting  syntactic consequences, such as the
              behavior of anaphora. Another  syntactic attribute is auxiliary verbs that mark
              the position of the  subject (sit, stand, lie or move), encoding tense-aspect
              and deixis  (in articles and demonstratives.) The extent to which these
              attributes  are present in Mandan will be instrumental in achieving a better 
              understanding of the syntactic and discourse structure of Mandan 
              (synchronically and diachronically), of Siouan and other Native  American
              languages, and finally of language in general.   ***
