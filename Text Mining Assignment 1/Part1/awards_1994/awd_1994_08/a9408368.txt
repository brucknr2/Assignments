Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof T. Darrah Thomas of the Oregon State University will   engage in a study
              of the inner-shell excitation and deexcitation of   molecules by electron
              spectroscopy.  Of primary interest is the   development of facilities to
              perform Auger-photoelectron coincidence   spectroscopy in the gas phase and on
              using zero-kinetic energy   spectroscopy to determine the lifetimes of
              core-ionized molecules.  In   addition, the relationship between the
              inner-shell ionization energies   and other chemical properties will continue
              to be investigated.    In Auger-photoelectron spectroscopy the spectrum is
              measured in   coincidence with photoelectrons of selected energy.  This
              technique makes   it possible to study the deexcitation pathways of a single,
              selected   excited state and thereby it is an important aid in the
              understanding of   complex Auger spectra.  This technique has heretofore been
              applied only   to solids.  The aim of this project is to extend its
              applicability to   systems in the gaseous phase.  Core-ionization energies can
              be related   directly to the factors that influence a number of chemical
              properties.    Research in the two areas of Auger photoelectron spectroscopy
              and   core-ionization energies will contribute to a better understanding of  
              chemical phenomena.
