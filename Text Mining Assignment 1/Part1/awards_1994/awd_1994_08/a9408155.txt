Abstract    :
              9408155  Fonstad  Recent NSF-funded research at MIT has shown that InGaA1As
              quantum-  well, tunnel-barrier heterostructures can be produced with 
              intersubband energy level separations (n = 1 to n = 2) as large as  0.8 eV
              (1.55 um) and with TE-, as well as TM-, optical activity.   The proposed
              research project builds on these results, and will  focus (1) on developing
              structures with even larger level  separations; (2) on using femto-second
              pulse-probe techniques to  measure upper state lifetimes in quantum wells; (3)
              on studying the  optical properties (index of refraction and absorption
              coefficient)  in the vicinity of the intersubband absorption peaks, and on 
              studying bias- and population-induced changes in these properties;  and (4) on
              incorporating quantum-well, tunnel-barrier  heterostructures in waveguide
              geometry optoelectronic devices  (modulators, switches, and detectors).  The
              excited state lifetimes  in quantum wells are inherently very short (and can be
              shortened  further using their tunnel barriers) so it is anticipated that this 
              research will lead to the realization of faster, lower power  devices than are
              presently available in the 1.5 um spectral range.   It is also anticipated that
              these devices will show superior  temperature stability because they are based
              on intersubband,  rather than band-to-band processes.  ***
