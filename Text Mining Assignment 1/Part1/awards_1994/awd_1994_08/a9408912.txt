Abstract    :
              9408912    The focus of this research will be to develop methods using the 
              1,4-conjugate addition chemistry of alpha-aminoalkylcuprates to  prepare useful
              synthetic intermediates in ways that are both  diastereoselective and
              enantioselective.  The methodology will  be showcased in the synthesis of nine
              representative alkaloids.  %%%  With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
              Program is  supporting the research of Dr. R. Karl Dieter of the Department  of
              Chemistry at Clemson University.  Professor Dieter will  focus his work on
              developing a new organometallic reagents  known as an alpha-aminoalkylcuprates.
               The reagents will then  be used for the synthesis of representative natural
              products  from the class of compounds referred to as alkaloids.
