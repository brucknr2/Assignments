Abstract    :
              9408397  Werner     In this project the investigators are studying the
              consequnces of phenotypic plasticity to ecological performance of larval
              anurans.  They will identify the the factors that trigger the phenotypic change
              that occurs in the presence of predators and measure the dose response to
              inducing cues.  They will determine the mechanisms by which the morphological
              and behavioral shifts influence competitive ability and defense against
              predators.  They will also study how interactions with predators, leading to
              phenotypic shifts, can influence the competitive interactions between species
              at the same trophic level.    This research will yield new insights into the
              relationship between phenotypic plasticity, ecological performance, and
              ecological community structure.  This relationship is of great potential
              importance but has received very little study.  These studies should result in
              the development of mechanistic models that predict the interactions between
              organisms and the optimal combinations of phenotypic traits in different
              environments.  The results should have applications in conservation biology,
              management of biodiversity, and natural resource management.
