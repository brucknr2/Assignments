Abstract    :
              CHE-9408997  Peterson  Fdn for Advancement of Ed in Sci  This grant, which is
              jointly funded by the Americas Program in the Division of International
              Programs and by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of
              Chemistry, provides support for Mr. Eden Netto of the Federal Center for
              Technological Education of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil, to compete the development
              and testing of a broad range fiber optic based pH sensor.  This project is
              being conducted collaboratively with Dr. John D. Peterson of the Biomedical
              Engineering and Instrumentation Program, National Center for Research
              Resources, National Institutes of Health.  This three month award complements
              initial funding for Mr. Netto which was provided through a two-year fellowship
              awarded by Brazil's CNPQ.    Fiber optic pH sensors that respond to a broad
              range of acidities are technologically innovative, non-invasive devices that
              are broadly applicable in biomedical diagnosis, environmental analysis, and
              process biotechnology.  It is expected that the successful completion of this
              project will not only give rise to a particularly useful pH sensor but will
              also serve as a focal point for further U.S. - Brazil scientific interactions.
