Abstract    :
                    9408934  Judith Kidd    An important new area of anthropological genetics
              involves  the analysis of genetic distributions in native North  American
              populations.  Analyses of new data on 35 nuclear  DNA markers at 23 independent
              loci tyhped on five Amerindian  populations and seven Old World populations
              show a North-  South pattern of gene frequency variation for Amerindian 
              populations with decreased heterozygosity in South America  and increasing
              genetic distance from Asian and other Old  World populations in a cline
              fromNorth America to South  America.  This patternis most simply explained by
              an  advancing wave of population expansion from north to south  in the
              colonization of the Americas.    The objective of this research is to test this
              hypothesis of  the expanding wave in two ways: by studying more Amerindian 
              poulations, a Siberian population, and two western Pacific  populations for the
              same markers and ty typing a minimum of  15 additional nuclear DNA markers,
              with an emphasis on  haplotype markers on all populations.  The resulting data 
              will add signifiantly to the u derstanding of how the  colonizing populations
              expanded to "fill" the Americas.  ***
