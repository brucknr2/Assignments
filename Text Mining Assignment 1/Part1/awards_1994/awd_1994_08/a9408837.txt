Abstract    :
              This project will develop new methods for multivariate  longitudinal data with
              nonrandomly missing data such as arise  with attrition from the sample. Maximum
              likelihood and Bayesian  inference will be derived for a variety of pattern-
              mixture  models, which stratify the data by the pattern of missing data  and
              identify parameters by exploiting assumptions about the  missing-data
              mechanism. Methods will be developed for general  patterns of missing data,
              normal repeated measures models,  multivariate t models that accommodate
              outlying values, and data  involving mixtures of continuous and categorical
              variables. The  methods will be compared with existing methods, including those
               based on stochastic censoring models. Tests for the type of  missing-data
              mechanism will also be developed.   Many important scientific studies involve
              repeated measures of  subjects over time. A common problem in analyzing such
              studies is  that some subjects are missing some of their measurements,  because
              they miss visits or do not stay in the study to the end.  Discarding such
              incomplete cases is wasteful, and can lead to  erroneous conclusions when the
              cases that are completely observed  differ systematically from those that are
              incomplete. This grant  studies methods of analyses that include all the data
              and  incorporate a variety of reasons for why values are missing.
