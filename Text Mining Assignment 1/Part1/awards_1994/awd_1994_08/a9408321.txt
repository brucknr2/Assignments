Abstract    :
              It is proposed to apply hydrostatic pressure  to vary the built-in strain to
              conduct a  study of the physical processes responsible for the improvements in
              the laser characteristics with  strain.  Calculations of the strain in the
              laser structures under pressure show that an additional  strain is generated in
              the laser active area due to the difference in the elastic constants between 
              the active and cladding years.  The cladding and carrier confinement layers,
              being much thicker than  the active layer, deform isotropically with pressure. 
              The additional strain created by high pressure  will allow for the first time
              the tuning of the initial built-in strain from compressive to tensile in  a
              single device.  In t his way, it will be possible to evaluate solely the effect
               of strain and avoid  variations in the growth conditions which take place when
              the effect of strain is evaluated by  comparing devices from different waters
              with different compositions.
