Abstract    :
              9408162 Mahin Considerable research is underway throughout the world to identify
              effective, practical and reliable methods for evaluating the seismic safety of
              existing bridges and for reducing their vulnerability through retrofit.  The
              U.S. and Japan are at the forefront of these activities, as well as of their
              practical implementation.  It is important for researchers and practitioners
              from the U.S. and Japan to meet periodically to exchange technical data as well
              as to identify issues of mutual concern and opportunities for cooperative
              study.  The project convenes a second U.S.  Japan Workshop on Seismic Retrofit
              of Bridges.  This workshop will be held in conjunction with the U.S.   Japan
              Workshop on Earthquake Protective Systems for Bridges.  This seismic retrofit
              workshop will focus on recent research and applications of retrofit technology,
              rather than state of the art reviews.  Topics to be covered during the workshop
              include: (1) advanced assessment and prioritization techniques; (2) design
              methods for seismic retrofit of bridges; (3) issues related to foundation
              evaluation and retrofit; (4) case studies of bridge assessment and retrofit;
              (5) recent research; and (6) the development of comparative retrofit examples. 
              Both steel and reinforced concrete bridges will be covered and issues related
              to the broad spectrum of bridges found throughout  the U.S. and Japan are
              addressed. ***
