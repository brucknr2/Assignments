Abstract    :
              Professor Knobler is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies of Langmuir  
              monolayers of amphiphiles.  He is examining long range order in self  
              organizing monlayers, and the phase transitions which occur in these two  
              dimensional assemblies.  Fluorescence microscopy and Brewster angle  
              microscopy are used to distinguish the optical textures corresponding to  
              different molecular orientations.  The experimental results are compared   with
              a mean-field theory of these textures which has been developed.    These
              methods will also be employed to examine the structures and   kinetics of
              growth of mosaic textures that are characteristic of certain   condensed
              monolayer phases.    Langmuir monolayers are films of a single molecular layer
              that can be   formed at the interface between air and water.  They are composed
              of   amphiphilic moleucles such as long chain fatty acids, esters and  
              alcohols.  Such films provide an opportunity to study two-dimensional  
              systems, and they provide structural insights into biochemical systems   such
              as lipid bilayers.  These monolayers can be transferred as   Langmuir-Blodgett
              films to solid supports, and may be employed as   sensors, and as electronic
              devices.
