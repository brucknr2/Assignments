Abstract    :
              9408004  Meffert   Current research has shown that a recovery from a crash in
              population size (i.e., bottleneck) can involve increased potential for shifts
              in the reproductive traits due to apparent release from the non-additive
              genetic constraints that operated on the ancestral state.  The proposed study
              will examine the degree to which populations can exploit such perturbed genetic
              structure.  First, genetic constraints on reproductive traits will be
              identified through the resistance of a housefly population to selection upon
              multivariate (composite) components of videotaped mating behavior.  Secondly, a
              derived bottleneck population that is determined to have a significant genetic
              disruption (through parent-offspring comparisons) and the stock control will
              each be subjected to selection upon the multivariate trait that exhibited low
              selectional response to the ancestor.  Line cross analysis will evaluate how
              non additive genetic components (e.g., dominance and epistasis) may be
              converted to additive genetic variance through the bottleneck event and tests
              on mate recognition will assess the consequences of shifts in mating
              repertoires.  Such experiments on the genetic properties of populations near
              extinction are critical to management of endangered species of pest invasions
              in that they identify genetic processes that mould traits in equilibrium
              populations.
