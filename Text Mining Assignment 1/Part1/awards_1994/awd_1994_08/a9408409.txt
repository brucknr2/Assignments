Abstract    :
                Liquid films on a substrate can become unstable due to various effects that
              exist in many engineering processes. These include gravity, temperature
              gradients, and interfacial effects. Through many analytical and experimental
              studies, the initial development of the instabilities has been well understood.
                 The main objective of the proposed research is to examine the flow behavior
              beyond the initial instabilities. To achieve this goal the conventional
              weakly-nonlinear analysis, such as the dynamical-system approach will be
              extended, and a finite-element method introduced.  The secondary and, for the
              first time, the fully-nonlinear behavior of three-dimensional films through a
              careful interplay of nonlinear analysis and full-scale computation will be
              investigated.  In particular, focus will be placed on the wave-breaking of
              isothermal films and the rupture of heated films.  The new information on these
              critical flow behaviors obtained through the proposed research will provide
              substantial contributions to the development of modern materials-processing
              technology.  The vectorized numerical code developed will solve the coupled
              hydrodynamic, thermal, and mass-transfer system with free boundaries, and will
              serve as a platform for further generation to non-Newtonian materials
              processing with phase changes.
