Abstract    :
              9408082  Webers   This award supports a workshop of the geology of the 
              Ellsworth Mountains, Antarctica.  The Ellsworth Mountains  are part of a
              continental block that was part of East  Antarctica prior to the breakup of
              Gondwana.  This block  occupies a key position in the tectonic micro-plates of
              West  Antarctica and so it is especially important to understand  its full
              geologic development.  This region is particularly  important to the overall
              objectives of the ANTALITH program  (an integrated geophysical and geological
              traverse across  West Antarctica to East Antarctica) which are to 
              understanding the structure of the continental crust across  the boundary
              between West Antarctica and East Antarctica.   This workshop will allow
              scientists to review recently  completed work in light of the new hypothesis
              that North  America and Antarctica were part of a pre-Gondwana  supercontinent
              and will allow discussion, debate, and  definition, of future research
              objectives in the Ellsworth  Mountains region.  ***
