Abstract    :
              9408915  Lichtenberg    This two-year award supports an empirical investigation
              of R&D  exchange and collaboration, and specialization, within the  European
              Union, using a number of large electronic databases on  research and
              development activities within European Union  countries.      This project will
              estimate measures of the structure of  international technological cooperation,
              such as the relative  frequency of collaboration between different countries;
              and  measures of the distribution of each industry's "knowledge base"  by
              detailed research field.  In addition, the project will  reexamine several
              important hypotheses about R&D specialization  and collaboration, e.g., the
              relationships between the  characteristics of organizations, the nature of the
              R&D they  conduct and the R&D results they produce, and their demand for 
              collaboration.    This study of these European data will provide important 
              comparative findings to the US research community engaged in the  analysis of
              the conduct of research and development in the public  and private sectors.  *
