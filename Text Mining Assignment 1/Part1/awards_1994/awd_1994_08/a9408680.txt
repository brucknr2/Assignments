Abstract    :
              9408680  Sejnowksi    Recently a new field of engineering has emerged, referred
              to as neuromorphic  engineering, that is based on the design and fabrication of
              artificial neural systems, such  as vision chips, head-eye systems, and roving
              robots, whose architecture and design  principles are based on those of
              biological nervous systems. A two-week workshop on  neuromorphic engineering
              will be held to bring together young investigators and more  established
              researchers from academia with their counterparts in industry and national 
              laboratories, working on both neurobiological as well as engineering aspects of
              sensory  systems and sensory-motor integration. Formal lectures will be given,
              but the primary  focus will be hands-on experience with research tools for all
              participants. The workshop  will serve as a bridge between the engineering
              world of artificial neural systems and the  neuroscience community. The
              workshop will provide an environment for intensive  interactions between
              members of these two communities - merging engineering  principles with
              experimental results from neuroscience. The workshop will also serve as  a
              prototype for the development of a similar yearly summer workshop. The
              interaction  of these two disciplines should have significant impact both on
              the development of new  technologies (new artificial neural systems) and on our
              understanding of how the  nervous system is designed.***
