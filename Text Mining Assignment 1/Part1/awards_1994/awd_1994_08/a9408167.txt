Abstract    :
                 The objective of this Research Planning Grant (RPG)  is to initiate the study
              of multiple domination in graphs.    A node in a graph G=(V,E) is  said to
              dominate  itself and its neighbors.  A subset of the  vertices S is a
              dominating set if  each node of V is  dominated by some node of S.  Interest in
              the concept of  domination has mushroomed in the last twenty years as can be 
              evidenced by over  500 publications on the subject.  Furthermore, over 60 types
              of domination have  been defined  and studied.  No doubt one reason for this
              interest is its  many  applications in computer science areas such as network 
              design and analysis of  algorithms.    A recent paper introduces multiple
              domination as a  generalization of classical domination in graphs.  A set S  is
              a k-multiple  dominating set for G if each node in V is  dominated by at least
              k distinct  nodes in S.  This new  concept in which each node is in a sense
              redundantly  dominated is a rich topic for research and potential 
              applications.  In general,  any question asked about ordinary  domination can
              be asked about multiple  domination.  This  research investigates multiple
              domination and develops  the most promising research issues for future study.
