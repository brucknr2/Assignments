Abstract    :
              Financial support is requested for a meeting covering  various aspects of
              developmental biology.  The specific  objectives are to assemble a group of
              scientists with broad  expertise in modern molecular analysis of development,
              have  a series of 54 talks on up-to-date research, and have about  100 other
              attendees present posters describing their  research.  The meeting will be held
              on the University of  California - Santa Cruze campus from June 25 through June
               30, 1994.
