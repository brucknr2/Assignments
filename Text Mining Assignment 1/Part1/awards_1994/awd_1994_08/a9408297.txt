Abstract    :
              9408297  Schimel   The main objective of this research is to determine what
              causes shifts in community composition during succession, and how do ecological
              processes change as a result of these changes in species composition. This
              research focuses primarily on how the vascular plant community in Alaskan taiga
              vegetation changes during succession, and how these changes affect and are
              affected by the soil microbial community. Evidence exists to suggest that plant
              species may enhance their ability to occupy and maintain a site through
              modification of the soil environment. This occurs because the litter quality
              and chemical composition differs among tree species. Using field and laboratory
              procedures, this research will directly determine whether or not plant extracts
              affect microbial activities in associated soils.  %%%   The general notion that
              reciprocal interactions occur between aboveground and belowground processes has
              long been of interest, but rarely studies. With the development of new
              technology such questions are just beginning to be answered. This research will
              provide the baseline analyses for more detailed investigations of ecosystem
              feedbacks between aboveground and belowground communities.
