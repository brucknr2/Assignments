Abstract    :
              9408552  Clemens    The  purpose of this research is to investigate and optimize
               the  strengthening  mechanisms  in  epitaxial  metal  multilayers.   A 
              previous   grant  developed  the  capability  for   growing   and  structurally
               characterizing  epitaxial  (001)  oriented  FCC/BCC  superlattices  by 
              sputter  deposition.   Hardnesses   of   these  materials  were investigated
              and enhancements nearly  300%  found  over  the  rule of mixtures.  This
              remarkable phenomenon  is  the  subject   of  this  continued  program.   Using
               singly-oriented,  epitaxial  films,  both  the mismatch and relative 
              thickness  of  layers  are varied to deduce plastic flow mechanisms. 
              Structural  characterization    involves   high   resolution    cross-section 
              transmission  electron  microscopy of as-deposited  and  deformed  materials 
              so  that  the  atomic scale  defects  responsible  for  deformation  can be
              identified.  This information is incorporated  into  the modeling component of
              the program, which utilizes  both  continuum and atomistic approaches.  %%% 
              One  result of this program will be metal films of unusually high  hardness.  
              These films could find applications in semiconductor,  information  storage, 
              and coatings technologies.   In  addition,  this  program  should  develop 
              fundamental  understanding  about  plastic deformation in layered materials and
              ultra-thin films.  ***
