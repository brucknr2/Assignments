Abstract    :
              9408742  Jacobson  Univ. of Houston  Dr. Allan J. Jacobson, Chemistry
              Department, University of Houston, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
              and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Chemical
              Reaction Processes Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division,
              under the NSF/EPRI initiative on Electrochemical Synthesis, for the study of
              the electrochemical synthesis of highly oxidized mixed metal oxides  via oxygen
              intercalation. Specific objectives are to advance the understanding of
              fundamental aspects of oxygen intercalation in oxides and to assess the use of
              intercalation chemistry for the synthesis and processing of new oxide
              materials. Preliminary results on an electrochemically reversible La-Ni-O phase
              will be extended to determine the detailed kinetics for oxygen intercalation.
              These investigations will then be continued on ternary copper oxides, where the
              physical properties will be correlated with precise electrochemical control of
              composition. Finally, the technique will be applied to a wide range of systems
              and electrolyte compositions to determine its generality.  Chemical compounds
              which contain several metals and oxygen have a number of uses, including  as
              electronic and superconducting materials, ceramics, and glasses. Often the
              properties of these solids depends upon their exact oxygen content, which is
              difficult to regulate using the methods which are presently available. In this
              project a new technique for introducing oxygen  into a "mixed metal oxide" will
              be developed using an electrochemical method. This will permit the formation of
              very oxygen rich materials under quite mild conditions. It will also allow the
              oxygen content to be precisely controlled in order to tailor the properties of
              the oxide.
