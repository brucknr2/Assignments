Abstract    :
              9408264  Raffa     We know very little about the extent to which pheromone
              chemistry of prey species has evolved in response to selection generated by
              predators that use pheromones to locate prey.  The PI is studing the ecological
              implications of bark beetle-predator semiochemical interactions.  He will test
              the hypotheses that 1) subtle shifts in pheromone chirality and secondary
              components may facilitate escape from predators, while retaining intraspecific
              functions, and 2) variation in bark beetle semiochemistry can affect
              reproductive success within colonized trees.      This research will yield new
              insights into the ecological relationships between insect predators and their
              prey, and , in particular, how prey adapt to reduce attack by predators that
              home in on their chemical communication systems (pheromones).  Because bark
              beetles are one of the major challenges to sustainable forestry, the results of
              this research will have important application to management of forests and
              bark-beetle outbreaks.
