Abstract    :
              9408452  Lodge     The study of plant-herbivore interactions in freshwater
              communities has lagged far behind similar investigations in terrestrial and
              marine systems.  Yet research in the latter two habitats has revolutionized our
              understanding of plant-animal interactions, ecosystem function, and
              coevolution.  This project extends methods and approaches developed for marine
              herbivore systems to little-studied freshwater herbivore systems.  The
              investigators are documenting: what plant traits deter herbivore consumption,
              the selectivity of freshwater herbivores, and the impact of generalist vs.
              specialist herbivores.  This research will allow the testing of important
              theories of plant defenses and herbivory developed in terrestrial and marine
              systems, and provide a unique opportunity for valuable comparisons between the
              three systems.      This research will improve our understanding of the ecology
              of plant-herbivore interactions and the role of macrophyte feeders in the
              function of aquatic ecosystems.  The results have application in the management
              of aquatic ecosystems.
