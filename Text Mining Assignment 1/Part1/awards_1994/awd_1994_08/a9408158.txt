Abstract    :
                9408158  Dong     The purpose of the proposed research is to obtain a
              projection  pursuit estimator for cell probabilities of high-dimensional 
              ordered contingency tables.  Discrete data often appear in the  form of
              contingency tables.  For instance, consider the  association among smoking
              statuses, age and breathing test  results.  A table consisting of the number of
              individuals in each  category is a three-dimensional ordinal contingency table.
               The difficulty of estimating cell probability of high-dimensional  tables is
              the lack of data.  A sample of 100 observations in a  one-dimensional table
              with 10 categories has an average cell  count of 10, but it only has an average
              cell count of 0.001 in a  five-dimensional table with the same number of
              categories in  each dimension. All the existing estimators share a common 
              problem known as the curse of dimensionality, which is caused by  the lack of
              data in high-dimensional tables. The proposed  research studies the features of
              high-dimensional data by looking  at its one-dimensional projections, which are
              no longer sparse.   A one-dimensional table is defined as a projection of a 
              d-dimensional table along an arbitrary direction.  An index is  introduced to
              evaluate the projections.  Interesting features can  be uncovered by using
              smaller smoothing parameters without  sacrificing the variance of the estimator
              -hus overcoming the  problem of the curse of dimensionality.  ***
