Abstract    :
              9408009  Whitham     Recent studies have shown that the genetic and phenotypic
              variation expressed by in plant hybrid zones has important effects on the
              distribution of herbivorous insects, fungi, and birds.  Hybrid zones can be
              centers of insect species richness and abundance.  This project continues a
              novel study of the ecological genetics of cottonwoods hybrid zones in Arizona. 
              The investigators are documenting the insect community correlates of plant
              genotype and making genetic maps of plant resistance and susceptibility traits.
               They are using synthetic populations and common garden experiments to
              determine why herbivores accumulate on some hybrids but not others.  Finally,
              they are establishing whether these interactions have affects on other members
              of the riparian community.      This research program is changing our view of
              the ecological importance of hybrid plants in natural communities.  The results
              of this research have applicability in conservation biology, design of natural
              reserves, and, potentially, forest and crop pest control.
