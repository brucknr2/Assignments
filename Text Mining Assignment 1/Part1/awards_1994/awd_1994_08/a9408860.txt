Abstract    :
              9408860  Wood                              ABSTRACT                             
                                                                                  The
              insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are  proposed to have
              roles in brain development by modulating  actions of insulin-like growth
              factors (IFGs).  To directly  test the role IGFBP-2 in the developing nervous
              system, Dr  Wood established a mutant line of mice deficient in IGFBP-2.  In
              these studies she proposes to study both normal and IGFBP-  2 deficient mice to
              test the hypothesis that IGFBP-2  modulates the rate of cell division in the
              developing brain  and to study the interactions between the IGFBPs, IGFs and 
              other growth factors in the central nervous system.
