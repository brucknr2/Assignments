Abstract    :
              9408692  Bazzaz   Partial financial support is requested for a workshop to be
              held in Basel-Luenberg, Switzerland, during the period of 14-19 August 1994.
              The workshop is one of a series of workshops and symposia organized by the
              Global Change in Terrestrial Ecosystems program of the International
              Geosphere-Biosphere Program. This workshop will bring together leading
              researchers on the effects of global change on populations and communities. The
              workshop will include both experimentalists and modelers. This is an area of
              research that has not been emphasized previously, but the scientific community
              is now poised to greatly expand research efforts in this direction. The
              workshop aims to review and analyze the state of knowledge, and identify
              critical questions and future directions. The results will be published in a
              book edited by the organizers.   %%%  This conference is the first to focus
              directly on how global change will affect population and community level
              phenomena. The conference includes some of the world's leading experts on these
              topics. The proceedings from this workshop should provide a clear focus for
              future global change research.
