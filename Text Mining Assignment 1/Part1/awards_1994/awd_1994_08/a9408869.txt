Abstract    :
              9408869  Kreitman       This research will examine DNA sequence features
              associated  with naturally occurring chromosomal rearrangements in natural 
              populations of the fruitfly, Drosophila.  Rearrangement of the  genetic
              material, such as that caused by chromosomal translocations  and inversions,
              are common; however, they are also causally  associated with a number of
              genetic diseases in humans and other  species.  In addition, the aberrant
              segregation of many kinds of  rearrangements with non-rearranged chromosomes in
              also strongly  deleterious.  Despite this expectation that gross rearrangement
              of  chromosomal material will have strongly negative fitness  consequences, and
              therefore should be rare in nature, their  presence as polymorphisms in natural
              populations of many species  and as fixed differences between species, suggests
              that many  inversions must, in some cases, be selectively neutral or 
              favorable.  It is the goal of this research to examine the history  of several
              inversions and to test hypotheses about the maintenance  of genetic variation
              as well as to investigate the influence of  chromosomal rearrangement on the 
              expression and function of genes  near the breakpoints.  This work will also
              produce insights into  the molecular mechanism(s) leading to chromosomal
              breakage.  The  findings will have direct applicability to the understanding of
               human variation and disease.
