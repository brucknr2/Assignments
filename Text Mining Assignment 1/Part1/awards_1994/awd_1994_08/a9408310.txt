Abstract    :
                    9408310  Tab Rasmussen/Ellen Miller    During  the lower Miocene, the
              African-Arabian and Turkish  tectonic plates collide, resulting in a land
              bridge between  Africa and Eurasia.  For the first time in the entire 
              Cenozoic, animal could move between those two continents.  Before then in
              Africa, the isolated animal species were  mostly primates, elephants, hyraxes,
              and cerodonts.  In this  new period, new primates, carnivores, and hooved
              animals  appeared for the first time, and much of the present day  fauna can be
              traced to that period,  including the origin  and early evolution of the Old
              World monkeys.  Many of these  important early Miocene animals are preserved as
              fossils in  the rocks at Wadi Moghara, although most of the African  sites of
              this period are in the East African Rift Valley  system. The taxonomic
              diversity of the fossils at Moghara,  coupled with the site's great distance
              from most other early  Miocene localities, makes the further study and
              excavation  at Moghara important.    This project, by a graduate student, will
              result in the  collection of more fossil mammals from this important site,  an
              examination of all Moghara museum specimens and important  comparative
              collections, a revision of the systematics of  the Moghara mammals, and an
              investigation of the  relationships between these mammals and other early
              Miocene  faunas.    It will make important paleontological contributions as
              well  as aiding in the training of a new scientist.
