Abstract    :
              9408215  Adkins       The structure of positronium is governed almost entirely
              by  QED.  Strong and weak interactions are small compared to  electrodynamic
              effects.  The research concentrates on the energy  levels and decay rates of
              this system and is designed to resolve  the present discrepancies between
              theory and experiment.  Comparison of theory and experiment will provide an
              excellent  test of the bound state formalism and QED.  ***
