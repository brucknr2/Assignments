Abstract    :
              9408977  Morrison       Research into the theoretical treatment of low energy 
              vibrational and rotational excitation of simple molecules such as  H2 and N2
              needed for a fundamental understanding of the  interactions of electrons with
              molecular targets will be pursued.  In addition, a new project involving the
              collision of Rydberg  atoms with noble gases will be initiated to study the
              effects of  alignment and orientation on the behavior of low-energy cross 
              sections.  ***
