Abstract    :
              1

              the by-product of increased human clearing and utilization of land in the
              tropical regions of the Americas. The limited time duration in which much of
              this land can be kept in agriculture or pasture causes much of this land to
              revert to secondary forest. Much remains to be learned about the formation and
              structure of these secondary forests. Leafcutter ants are found to be incident
              at 10 to 100 fold higher numbers in secondary forest compared to primary
              forest. They play important ecological roles in defoliation of selected tree
              species and as modifiers of physical and chemical nature of the soils. This
              project investigates the biogeochemical influence of cutter ants by
              characterizing nest sites, soils, and tree growth at sites with and without ant
              populations.    This research is important because it considers the role of the
              dominant herbivore in these ecosystems which are recovering after human
              utilization and abandonment. Belowground processes in the soils of tropical
              ecosystems are major controls on the recovery of these ecosystems after
              disturbance. The leafcutter ant may well play a crucial role in improving soil
              conditions to facilitate forest re-establishment. This research will begin to
              address this potential interaction, and test the hypothesis that this prolific
              invertebrate enhances tree growth in these transitional ecosystems.
