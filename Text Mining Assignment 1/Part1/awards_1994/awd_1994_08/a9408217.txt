Abstract    :
              ***  9408217  Sanchez    This U.S.-Argentina Joint Workshop award supports
              travel  expenses of 15 researchers in the material sciences, who  will
              participate in the  " First U.S.- Argentina Bilateral  Symposium on Materials
              Science and Engineering" to be held  in  Buenos Aires,Argentina  in November,
              1995.  Some  publication and communication costs  related to the workshop  are
              also covered.  The P.I. and organizer of the workshop is  Prof.  Juan Sanchez,

              Rapaccioli of CITEFA,  Argentina.  The objectives of the workshop are to 
              explore  areas of common interest to researchers of both countries in 
              materials science and engineering and to identify U.S. and  Argentine
              investigators who may make significant  contributions to joint research in
              these areas. The workshop  will consist of five technical sessions and a half
              day of  panel discussions. The workshop will be of wide scope,  covering
              pivotal topics in materials, their properties,  processing and uses. The panel
              discussion will consider  priorities for fruitful collaboration between the
              U.S. and  Argentina.  ***
