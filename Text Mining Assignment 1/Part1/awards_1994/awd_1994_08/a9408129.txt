Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for the development of a state-of-art scanning  near-field
              infrared microscope that involves the use of highly  collimated, tunable
              infrared sources such as free electron  lasers. This instrument is expected to
              have many applications in  both materials science and biological systems,
              because it  combines the exquisite spectral resolution of infrared 
              spectroscopy with high-resolution imaging down to 0.05 micrometers without 
              compromising on the frequency resolution of conventional IR  spectroscopy.
              Furthermore, the intrinsically large characteristic  absorption coefficients in
              the infrared mean that it is possible  to obtain images with contrast as large
              as 1 part in 105 without  resorting to any staining procedures. The proposed
              microscope  should satisfy a long-felt need for an imaging technique that is 
              capable of non-destructive identification of the chemical  composition of
              surfaces.   %%%  It has long been appreciated that the combination of infrared 
              spectroscopy with imaging would provide a valuable technique for  examining
              surfaces non-destructively. However, the promise of  this technique was limited
              by the poor spatial resolution set by  the long wavelengths of the infrared
              radiation when used with  conventional imaging techniques. In this work, the
              recent  breakthroughs in optical near-field scanning probe microscopy,  and the
              availability of highly collimated, tunable infrared  sources such as free
              electron lasers, are used to construct an  infrared near-field
              microspectroscope that can achieve a spatial  resolution of 0.05 micrometers.
              This novel instrument has the potential  for revolutionizing the
              characterization of materials.
