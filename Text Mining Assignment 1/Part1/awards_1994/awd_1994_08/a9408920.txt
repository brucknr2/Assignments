Abstract    :
              9408920  Freeman    Under the direction of Dr. Leslie Freeman, Mr. James Pokines
              will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze  microfaunal
              materials excavated from the archaeological site of  El Juyo which is located
              in the Santander region of Spain. The  site was occupied by Paleolithic hunters
              and gatherers about  14,000 years ago and the intermittent habitation spans a
              period  of approximately 1,000 years. The extremely rich lithic and  faunal
              remains recovered provide a unique insight into human  adaptation at the end of
              the last Ice Age. Mr. Pokines wishes to  use the abundant micromammal remains
              which are also present to  reconstruct environment and determine how it changed
              over time.  Because larger mammals entered the cave as food and therefore 
              reelect human selection, they do not provide an accurate  environmental signal.
              The incorporation of micromammals however  results from a different process:
              owls which inhabited the cave  during human absence regurgitate pellets which
              contain the bones  of prey. Studies of modern owl behavior indicate that their
              prey  selection closely mirrors natural abundances of small mammals in  a
              region. Mr. Pokines will collect modern pellets to determine  the present day
              species composition. With this as a baseline, he  will then study the
              archaeological sample.    This work is important for several reasons.
              Archaeological data  provides excellent insight into human-environment
              interactions  over long periods of time. They shed light on how humans both 
              adapted to and in turn effected the natural surroundings on which  they
              depended for survival. The data collected by Mr. Pokines  will shed light on
              this relationship during an important period  of human prehistory. The research
              will also assist in the  training of a promising young scientist.
