Abstract    :
              The objective of this program is to research, develop, and explore applications
              of a new  type of optical flow sensor that can measure ultra-flow volumetric
              flow rates in real time with three  orders  of magnitude more sensitivity than
              the best commercially available  mass flow meters (which  use acoustic
              techniques).  The performance of this new flow  sensor is predicted to rival
              the best  laser doppler velocimetric results in its linear velocity
              sensitivity.  However, it directly measures  volumetric flow rates instead of
              point particle velocities.  In addition it should be a much cheaper 
              technology.  Such an instrument can find a wide range of applications in
              materials processing, medical  instrumentation, and chemical measurement and
              analysis, both in terms of serving present needs and in  being a new
              measurement tool for further research within these areas.  In this program, we
              will apply  the sensor to directly observe slow flows and diffusions associated
              with liquid chromatography  systems.  The sensor concept is based on the
              relativistic Fresnel drag effect which causes the speed  of lig ht to differ
              between upstream and downstream directed beams.  The difference in speed is 
              linearly proportional  to the flow velocity and can be measured with extreme
              sensitivity using a  state-of-the-art fiber optics Sagnac interferometer.
