Abstract    :
              9408327  Smolker                              ABSTRACT                          
                                                                                     Dolphins
              are notorious for the wide variety of sounds they  produce, described
              picturesquely as whistles, squeaks,  squeals, grunts, growls, etc.  They are
              also exceptional  among animals in that they show evidence of both the ability 
              to accurately mimic different types of whistles and also to  learn
              vocalizations.  These skills are shared with humans,  but otherwise occur only
              among some songbirds and parrots.  Although there has been much conjecture
              about the  possibility of a dolphin "language", almost nothing is known  about
              most of the sounds dolphins use, in part because the  sounds are difficult to
              analyze.  Dr. Smolker project will  use a new technique to analyze dolphin
              "burst-pulse" sounds  and how they are used by wild dolphins in Shark Bay,
              Western  Australia.
