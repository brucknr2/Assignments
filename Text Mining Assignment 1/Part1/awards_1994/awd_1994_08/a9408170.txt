Abstract    :
              9408170  Brown                              ABSTRACT                            
                                                                                   The
              long-term objectives of this project are to understand  how new brain cells can
              be added  to adult brains.  In  mammals including humans, brain cells called
              neurons are  created only during very early development, and neurons that  are
              lost as a result of injury or disease cannot be  replaced.  Using an animal
              model in which neurons are added  to already-existing brain circuits which are
              important for  learning and producing sounds used to communicate,  anatomical
              and behavioral studies will address the  biological events that promote the
              addition of new neurons  to the brain.  Understanding how neurons may be added
              to the  brain could lead to therapies which would ameliorate the  devastating
              effects of neurological disease.
