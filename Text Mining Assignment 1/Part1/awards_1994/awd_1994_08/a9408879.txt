Abstract    :
              9408879  Yuan       The quantum ramifications of chaotic scattering in several 
              model atomic and molecular systems is investigated.  New  mechanisms for the
              formation of long-lived collision complexes, e-  He+ periodic orbits, phase
              space structures corresponding to  chemical bonding and isotope effects on
              HeRh2+ near the metallic  tip of an electron field microscope are studied in
              using a  variety of semiclassical approaches.  ***
