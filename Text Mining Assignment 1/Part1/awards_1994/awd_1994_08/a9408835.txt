Abstract    :
              9408835  Maple    This project investigates strongly correlated electron 
              phenomena in f-electron and d-electron systems.  These  phenomena include
              non-Fermi-liquid low temperature  characteristics associated with
              unconventional Kondo effects  in doped f-electron systems, superconductivity
              and magnetism  in heavy fermion compounds and the formation of small energy 
              gaps due to hybridization between localized f- and  conduction-electron states
              in hybridization gap  semiconductors (also called Kondo insulators). 
              Rare-earth  and uranium intermetallic compounds and alloys, in both 
              polycrystalline and single crystal form, will be prepared  and characterized. 
              Transport, thermal, and magnetic  measurements will be made over a wide range
              of temperatures.  The research involves collaboration with a number of other 
              universitities and national laboratories, including the  National High Magnetic
              Field Laboratory.  %%%  This project involves the study of a group of metallic 
              superconductors called heavy Fermion superconductors.  These materials differ
              in some of their properties from  normal superconductors and the
              high-temperature copper oxide  superconductors.  The reasons for these
              differences are not  understood,  so investigations of the heavy Fermion
              systems  may shed light on the perplexing problem of the high-Tc  materials. 
              New heavy Fermion materials will be prepared and  characterized by a range of
              techniques.  While these studies  are of fundamental scientific interest, they
              are also of  importance in the development of useful materials for  industrial
              applications.  The research involves  collaboration with a number of other
              universities and  national laboratories, including the National High Magnetic 
              Field Laboratory.  The research will contribute to the  training of
              postdoctoral research scientists and graduate  students at UCSD and at the
              collaborating institutions.  ***
