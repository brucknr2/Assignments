Abstract    :
              9408216  Feder    Almost all organisms synthesize a number of characteristic 
              proteins in response to high temperatures and other stresses;  these are termed
              "stress proteins" or "heat-shock protein". In  the laboratory, improved
              resistance to stress coincides with the  synthesis of these proteins. At
              present, major gaps in scientific  knowledge include: (1) Whether the
              conditions that induce these  proteins in the laboratory are ever encountered
              in nature; (2)  Whether the proteins are adaptive under natural conditions; (3)
               How these proteins actually improve resistance to stress. This  project will
              contribute to the filling of these gaps by examining  strains of fruit flies
              (Drosophila) that have been genetically  engineered to synthesize very
              different levels of a key stress  protein, hsp70. The project first will
              document natural exposure  of wild Drosophila to two likely stresses
              (temperature and  ethanol), and measure corresponding hsp70 concentrations in
              these  organisms. Next, it will use this information to design  laboratory
              experiments in which Drosophila strains differing in  hsp70 expression undergo
              exposure to each stress. After first  confirming that the expected differences
              in hsp70 actually occur  under experimental conditions, the project will assess
              the  consequences of differential hsp70 expression for the ability of 
              Drosophila to grow and reproduce successfully under stress.  Finally, the
              project will engineer Drosophila cell lines  differing in hsp70 expression with
              a light-emitting protein to  test whether hsp70 can repair a stress-damaged
              protein. The  proposed research is significant because (1) it will gather basic
               but presently unavailable data on the natural conditions  experienced by
              Drosophila, one of the primary models in modern  biological research; (2) it
              will assess the linkages, if any  between manifestations of the stress response
              at the  molecular/cellular level and organismal performance; (3) it will 
              prospectively identify candidate mechanisms for study  at the 
              cellular/molecular level; and (4) it will lay the groundwork for  a priori
              predictions and test of the evolution of physiological  characteristics.  ***
