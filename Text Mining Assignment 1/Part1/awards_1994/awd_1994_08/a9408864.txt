              Abstract  ATM-9408864  Clark, James S.  Duke University  Title: Sediment Records
              of Biomass Burning    Biomass burning profoundly affects atmospheric chemistry,
              the  carbon cycle, and climate of biomass burning may have been greater  in the
              past, before large increases in fossil fuel combustion.  A  principal obstacle
              to progress on understanding the past role of  biomass burning rests with the
              interdisciplinary nature of the  problem.  This award supports a NATO Advanced
              Research Workshop to  assemble the paleo records of past combustion and 
              atmospheric and  terrestrial expertise needed to interpret the effects of
              emissions  on past global changes.  Specific goals of the workshop are to:     
               i)   Better characterize sedimentary constituents and              
              parameterize transport to sediments;       ii)  Calibrate lacustrine, marine,
              and ice-core records of          biomass burning;       iii) Identify the Data
              sets that could be used to quantify       past biomass burning;       iv)
              Estimate past mass fluxes of combustion-derived       particulates and organic
              tracers; and       v) Estimate past rates of biomass burning  The program
              includes a balanced representation of fire ecologists,  paleoecologists, and
              atmospheric chemists.
