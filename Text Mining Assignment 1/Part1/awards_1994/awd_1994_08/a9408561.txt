Abstract    :
              9408561  Hoffman  Northwestern University  Dr. Brian M. Hoffman, Chemistry
              Department, Northwestern University, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division
              for a collaborative project with Dr. Anthony G. M. Barrett, Chemistry
              Department, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, for
              the synthesis and study of star porphyrazines, solitaire phthalocyanines and
              related multimetallic macrocycles. A series of porphyrazines bearing a variety
              of ligating ring subsituents  will be synthesized. These will be converted into
              multimetallic arrays, with metals bound to the peripheral heteroatoms as well
              as to the core of the central macrocycle. The resultant complexes may exhibit
              unusual spectroscopic, magnetic, or electrical properties properties due to
              electron delocalization and metal-metal interactions via the macrocycle
              pi-system.    Compounds in which contain several metals often have unique
              magnetic and electronic properties. In this project a series of such materials
              will be prepared. The specific design involves a central metal which is
              surrounded by a rigid structure of other atoms (a macrocyclic ligand) to which
              additional metal are attached. This results in star shaped or linear arrays of
              metal atoms which are expected to have a diversity of applications in such
              areas as materials research, catalysis, and diagnostic and therapeutic
              medicine.
