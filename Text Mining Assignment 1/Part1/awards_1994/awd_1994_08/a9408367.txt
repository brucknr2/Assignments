Abstract    :
              A number of important surface analytical tools rely on an understanding   of the
              transmission of ions through solids.  This research project,   supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is designed to   explore the
              fundamental scattering and charge transfer processes that   influence ion
              transport through solids having different chemical and   electronic properties.
               Electron stimulated desorption of ions from   substrates overlayed with thin
              films of metal and metal oxide will be   used to probe the transmission of ions
              through these layers.  Ion angular   distributions, yields, and ion charge
              exchange processes will be measured   for a range of different thin film
              overlayers.  The understanding   obtained from these studies will impact
              surface analysis methodology as   well as various material processing
              technologies using ions.      The detailed interactions of ions with solid
              surfaces are the focus of   this research project.  Using electron stimulated
              desorption of ions   through carefully controlled thin films of various
              materials, the   fundamentals of the ion-solid interaction will be probed. 
              This   information will be useful for the development of surface analytical  
              tools, and in the ion processing of solid surfaces.
