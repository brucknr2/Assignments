Abstract    :
              9408472  Davis  This workshop will define new research directions needed to 
              advance high-performance computing in the designated National  Challenge areas:
               health care, education, environment,  manufacturing.  The workshop will focus
              on software issues that  differ from those raised by the Grand Challenge
              problems.  To  assure concrete discussion, the workshop will focus on health 
              care applications.  Participants have been selected to provide  broad
              representation across the high-performance computation  community.  Application
              experts will also participate.  ***
