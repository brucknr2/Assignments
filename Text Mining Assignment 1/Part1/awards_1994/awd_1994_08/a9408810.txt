Abstract    :
              9408810  Peyghambarian  The goals of this proposed program are focused toward a
              combined  experiment/theory investigation of new nonlinear phenomena in low- 
              dimensional organic systems, developing realistic models to  understand the
              basic effects involved, and using these findings to  design and fabricate novel
              optoelectronic polymeric devices.   Specifically, our goals are threefold:  (1)
              Development and  construction of new highly efficient photorefractive polymeric
               devices for holographic storage and image processing applications.   Under our
              current NSF grant we have obtained the highest  diffraction efficiency (approx.
              34%) of any polymer so far.  A  respectable two-beam coupling gain (30 cm-1),
              with net gain of (6  cm-1, was also obtained.  We will optimize these devices
              by  improving the photogeneration efficiency and the electro-optic  effect. 
              (2) Device physics of electroluminescent (EL) pi-  conjugated polymers.  Our
              goals for this part of the project are to  understand the mechanism of
              electroluminescence in polymeric  materials like poly(p-phenylenevinylene)
              (PPV) and related pi-  conjugated polymers through combined experiment/theory
              studies of  the electronic structure, nonradiative decay processes, excited 
              state absorption, and optical gain investigation.  (3) Multiexciton  effects in
              low-dimensional organics.  The PI's have recently  reported the discovery of
              multiexciton chains in a quasi-one-  dimensional mixed-stack charge transfer
              organic solid and of  biexcitons in PPV.  These results revealed new excited
              state  absorptions to higher multiexciton states.  The PI's believe that  such
              multiexciton states would occur in other quasi-1-d materials  like the
              segregated stack CT solids.  ***
