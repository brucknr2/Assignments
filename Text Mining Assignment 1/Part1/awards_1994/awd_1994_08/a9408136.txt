Abstract    :
              9408136  Rickett    This one year award supports U.S.-United Kingdom cooperative
               research on high solar winds with Andrew J. Lyne of the  University of
              Manchester.  The objective of their research is to  conduct joint
              interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations of  the solar wind when the
              European space probe ULYSSES passes above  the Sun's south pole in summer 1994
              and above its north pole in  summer 1995. These observations will be part of an
              intensive  world-wide campaign to observe the solar wind simultaneously at a 
              wide range of distances and latitudes so that temporal evolution  can be
              distinguished from spatial structure.     The project takes advantage of the
              complementary expertise of the  U.S. and British investigators in solar winds
              and radio  astronomical observations, and provides access to the Merlin  radio
              antenna array in the United Kingdom.  This array is  especially well configured
              for IPS measurements. The  investigators will perform joint observations, data
              analysis and  model fitting.  Results and interpretation will involve other 
              U.S. and European scientists.  ***
