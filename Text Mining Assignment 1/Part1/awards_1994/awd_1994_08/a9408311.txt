Abstract    :
              9408311  Peccei  Support is requested from the National Science Foundation to 
              partially cover the costs of holding a two-week Summer Study in  Snowmass,
              Colorado on future directions in Particle and Nuclear  Astrophysics and
              Cosmology.  The Summer Study is jointly  sponsored by the Division of
              Astrophysics, the Division of  Nuclear Physics and the Division of Particles
              and Fields of the  American Physical Society.  The principal goal of this
              meeting is  to allow members of the disparate high energy and nuclear physics 
              communities and of the community of astrophysicists and  astronomers to examine
              jointly the opportunities that are opening  up in this cross disciplinary field
              and to provide a critical  evaluation of the future course of this emerging
              discipline.  ***
