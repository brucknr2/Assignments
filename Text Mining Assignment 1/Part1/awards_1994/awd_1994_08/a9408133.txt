Abstract    :
              9408133  Ono                              ABSTRACT                              
                                                                                 Various
              types of voltage-gated potassium channels determine  the pattern of electrical
              excitability in nerve cells.  In  the developing mouse hippocampus, a part of
              the brain  implicated in learning and memory, the appearance of  specific
              potassium currents of nerve cells in culture has  been shown to be controlled
              by the surrounding support cells  by an unknown mechanism.  The presence of
              cloned potassium  channel sequences in specific neurons will be ascertained 
              using molecular techniques and nucleic acid sequences  complementary to those
              present in these neurons will be used  to block the synthesis of these channels
              to correlate a  particular sequence with a specific potassium current.
