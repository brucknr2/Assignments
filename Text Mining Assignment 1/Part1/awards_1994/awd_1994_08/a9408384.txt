Abstract    :
                  This project will continue to support the development of a "Hierarchic
              Database  Management System and Networking for Systematic Biology."  In
              particular new data  models and query methods are being developed that employ
              the concept of "taxon  views", which can carry more historical taxonomic
              information about a particular  taxon and related taxa than is possible with
              regular taxon names.  In addition, the  project will involve development and
              testing of tools for greater access of these  database tools by the systematics
              community.
