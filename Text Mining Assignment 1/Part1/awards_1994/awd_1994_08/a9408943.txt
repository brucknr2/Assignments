Abstract    :
              9408943  Griswold    Funds are transferred to NOAA to support two NOAA Sea 
              Grant Fellows within the NSF Ocean Sciences Division.  Two  highly qualified
              students will work with OCE program staff  for one year.  Valuable experience
              will be gained by working  on ocean science research policy and administration.
               One  student will work with the Oceanographic Technology &  Interdisciplinary
              Coordination Program and the other with  the Biological Oceanography Program. 
              The Fellowship  Program is administrated through NOAA's Office of Oceanic 
              Research Programs.
