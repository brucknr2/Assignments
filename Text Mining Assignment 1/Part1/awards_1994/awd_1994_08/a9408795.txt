Abstract    :
                9408795  Sorensen  The research proposed here has two main objectives.  The
              first is to develop and test new algorithms and approaches for addressing
              computational operations that are encountered in a wide range of computational
              science and engineering applications (e.g.,eigenproblems,linear equation
              solvers an propagation methods).  The second is to enhance significantly the
              range of chemical reactions that can be studied with ab initio quantum
              scattering methods (e.g., four-atom systems and heavier three-atom systems). 
              The basic approach is to bring together in a single research team knowledge of
              an experience with the most advanced numerical algorithms for solving the kinds
              of mathematical problems that are at the core of these scattering methods.
