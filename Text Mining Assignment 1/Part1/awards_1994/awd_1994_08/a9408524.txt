Abstract    :
              9408524  Kerr  Knoxville College a Historically Black College with two campuses 
              requests support from NSF for connection of their two campus  networks to
              SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network located in  the southeastern United
              States.  Knoxville college has a main  campus in Knoxville, Tennessee which
              offers baccalaureate degrees  in 25 majors and associate degrees.  Their
              Morristown campus is   located 45 miles away in Morris, Tennessee.  This grant
              will fund  most of the external costs for the connecting to the Internet for 
              both campuses.  These cost are primarily for equipment and line  charges. 
              These connections will provide operations management and  information services
              and it will give the college a 56 thousand  bits per second connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45  million bits per second) National Backbone
              network.    The college has experienced a growth in auxiliary programs that has
               added value to the basic mission that the college serves to aid the  education
              of all persons of all ages.  The networking plan at  Knoxville College is the
              foundation for uniting all the disciplines  and campus groups.
