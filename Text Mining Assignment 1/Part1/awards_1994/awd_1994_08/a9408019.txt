Abstract    :
              9408019  Watson       The sagebrush tribe, Anthemideae, of the sunflower family
              is  the focus of extensive molecular phylogenetic analyses by Dr. Linda  Watson
              of the University of Oklahoma, to acquire new data for  taxonomic and
              genealogical study.  Data from restriction enzyme  mapping and gene sequencing
              of chloroplast DNA are being collected  from representatives of the ca. 1740
              species of the tribe, from  throughout the world.  These will be used to assess
              mutational  differences among species and genera, and to construct hypotheses 
              of phylogenetic relationship.  In turn, such molecule-based  phylogenies will
              be compared with current morphology-based  inferences, and areas of
              disagreement subjected to further study  with additional DNA datasets. 
              Corroborated patterns of  evolutionary history will provide test cases for
              evaluating changes  in mating systems, pollination (whether by wind or
              insects),  geographic distribution, and growth form in this widespread tribe.  
                  The Anthemideae provides an opportunity to examine patterns of 
              evolutionary relationships using modern molecular techniques and to  make
              direct comparisons to an existing morphology-based  phylogenetic tree and
              thereby assess the reliability of traditional  taxonomic characters.  The
              combined datasets will lead to a  comprehensive taxonomic account of an
              economically and ecologically  important group of plants.
