Abstract    :
              9408147  Kashket    This Americas Program award will support Prof. Eva  Kashket,
              Boston University, in a research  collaboration with Prof. Dolly Montoya,
              Biotechnology  Institute, National University of Colombia, Bogota.   The
              overall objective of the research is to enhance  the production of the valuable
              fermentation end  products, n-butanol and hydrogen by Clostridium 
              acetobutylicum, with the goal of finding a cost-  effective way of utilizing
              renewable biomass, instead  of petrochemical sources, for the fermentation 
              process.  Enhancement of hydrogen production will be  sought by isolating
              mutants of the C. acetobutylicum  deficient in butanol and acetone production;
              the  mechanism of butanol resistance will be determined by  studying resistance
              of membrane function and  composition to butanol.    The proposed research will
              be of fundamental  importance to understanding how microorganisms survive 
              under stress of membrane-damaging solvents in the  environment.  Isolation and
              cloning of butanol-  tolerant mutants will be an important achievement.   The
              biotechnology industry will benefit greatly by the   development of improved
              technologies for conversion of  biomass to commercial solvents, such as acetone
              and  butanol.  In countries where excess biomass is  available, the clostridial
              process would be of benefit  to the economy and also to the environment.It
              should  prove useful to the biotechnology industry,  particularly in the area
              of industrial fermentation  processes.   ***
