Abstract    :
                     9408820  Briggs         This research by a social anthropologist from
              Vassar College  involves the recording and analysis of narratives by Native 
              Americans about epidemic diseases which recently struck their  poor, forest
              community.  There was a devastating cholera epidemic  as well as measles and
              whooping cough epidemics, none of which  the Indians recognize as traditional
              diseases.  Their stories  represent the diseases as being inflicted by
              non-Indians in order  to weaken their society.  By analyzing how these
              narratives are  formed, transmitted, and circulate from Indian to non-Indian 
              contexts, the project will study how the symbolic aspects of diseases are
              represented.         The knowledge to be gained form this research will help 
              government agencies and NGOs communicate with ethnic groups to  ameliorate the
              devastating impact of health crises in this area,  and will add to our
              understanding of how ethnic groups who do not  have a bio-medical understanding
              of diseases form their own  cultural models of the diseases and how individuals
              in the groups  use these models for social and political advantage.  This sort 
              of knowledge will be valuable for dealing with similar situations  of
              inter-ethnic contact where each group's understanding of the  source of the
              crisis is different.
