Abstract    :
               A set of experiments are planned to investigate young infants' understanding of
              the meaning of affective expressions.  These experiments focus on a number of
              related abilities:  (1) the use of information for affect provided by acoustic
              features of different vocal expressions, (2) the role of face and voice in the
              portrayal an recognition of affect, (3) the effects of contextual information
              on the understanding of expressions, and (4) preferences for positive and
              negative expressions of emotion during infancy. Results of each of these
              experiments will combine to provide both a broader and more detailed picture of
              infants' abilities.   The perception of affect plays a crucial role in early
              development, particularly in the realm of communication and social interaction.
               As development proceeds, gaining an understanding of the expressive behaviors
              of others is a step in acquiring the more general capability of discerning
              other person's thoughts, intentions, desires and beliefs.  It is important to
              trace this developmental progression in order to understand deviations from the
              norm, such as are found for young children with autism.
