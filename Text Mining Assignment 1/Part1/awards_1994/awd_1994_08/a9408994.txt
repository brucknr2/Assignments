Abstract    :
              9408994  Burns       This award continues support for mathematical research on 
              geometric problems associated with domains and there boundaries  situated in
              spaces of several complex variables.  Two major areas  of study will be
              undertaken.  Both are concerned with  interpretation of renormalized
              characteristic classes and their  relation to analytic problems on complex
              manifolds with boundary.    The first involves uniformization and structure of
              complex  hyperbolic manifolds.  The uniformization question is that of 
              determining when a component of a complex manifold which is a  compact,
              connected, spherical CR-manifold can be realized as a  domain of a ball in
              n-complex variables modulo a properly  discontinuous group of CR-automorphisms.
               The second line of  investigation considers certain linear partial
              differential  equations with the goal of finding analytic interpretations of 
              characteristic numbers which are finite for Riemannian or Kahler  manifolds of
              infinite volume.  Work will also be done in an  effort to prove a converse to a
              recent result on Grauert tubes.   Namely, to show that all biholomorphisms of
              these manifolds are  induced by isometries.       Several complex variables
              arose at the beginning of the  century as a natural outgrowth of studies of
              functions of one  complex variable.  It became clear early on that the theory 
              differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was  far more
              difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more  affinity with partial
              differential operators of first order.  It  thus grew as a hybrid subject
              combining deep characteristics of  differential geometry and differential
              equations.  Many of the  fundamental structures were defined in the last three
              decades.   Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic 
              mathematical forms.
