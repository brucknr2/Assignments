Abstract    :
              9408698  Butterworth  This Americas Program award will partially support a 
              symposium in the field of biomonitoring technologies.   The symposium,
              organized by Dr. F. M. Butterworth,  Oakland University, Michigan, Dr. Dieter
              Reidel,  University of Windsor, Ontario, and Dr. Judith Guzman  Rivera of the
              Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones  Nucleares (ININ) in Mexico City, will
              take place in  conjunction with the annual conference of the  International
              Association of Great Lakes Research, in  Windsor, Ontario, June 1994.  The
              major objectives of  the symposium are to identify deficiencies and  problems
              with current monitoring strategies; to  present novel state-of-the art
              biomonitoring methods  and applications, and to stimulate new associations  and
              collaborations between North American Free Trade  (NAFTA) countries to respond
              to the challenges of  increased pollution rates.       Routine monitoring using
              biological test systems is  critical in the surveillance of aqueous
              environments  to identify hazards to human health.  The traditional  method of
              using biomonitors in conjunction  with  chemical analysis to detect pathologies
              caused by  toxic contaminants is hampered by the presence in the  environment
              of complex mixtures of these pollutants.   There is, therefore, an urgent need
              to accelerate  research in developing improved and new systems to  detect new
              hazards resulting from increased industrial  development of the NAFTA
              countries.  The work  presented and the standards recommended at this 
              symposium will be published as a reference resource  for the benefit of the
              scientific community,  regulatory agencies, and the public.  ***
