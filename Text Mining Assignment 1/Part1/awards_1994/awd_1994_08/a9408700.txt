Abstract    :
                   This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing  award. 
              Three-dimensional data taken from complex scenes place  strong demands on the
              robustness and generality of visible  surface reconstruction techniques.  In
              this research a complete  reconstruction algorithm will be developed that
              distinguishes  between surfaces, space curves, and clouds of points based on 
              asymmetries in point distributions in expanding three-dimensional  image
              neighborhoods.  The properties of this algorithm will be  studied analytically
              and confirmed experimentally on both  synthetic data and range data acquired
              from a variety of sensors.   The software will be made available to other
              researchers for  further testing.  The goal is to understand fully both the 
              strengths and weaknesses of the technique.  This will provide a  solid basis
              for future research and will make it easy to evaluate  the technique's
              usefulness for specific applications.  Potential  applications range from
              robotic navigation to reverse  engineering.
