              processing.  An important activity of IFIP is it biennial World Computer
              congress which provides an opportunity for the exchange of information between
              engineers and scientists world wide.    The federation on Computing in the U.S.
              (FOCUS), an unicorporated joint activity of the Association for Computing
              Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
              (IEEE) Computer Society, proposes to administer the travel grant program. 
              FOCUS serves as the U.S. representative to IFIP.  ***
