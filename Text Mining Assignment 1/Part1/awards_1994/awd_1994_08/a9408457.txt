Abstract    :
              This project combines analog circuit design and CAD to produce  digital circuits
              that can operate at substantially reduced  voltages, which will result in lower
              power consumption.  The  project has introduced the QuadRail logic family,
              which allows  voltage control of transistor thresholds to maintain constant
              logic  thresholds.  Use of this family permits lower supply voltages  because
              of the tighter control of device thresholds.  However, use  of this family
              requires optimization of individual digital cells,  new device layout methods,
              and new strategies for floorplanning,  placement, and routing.  The research in
              this project is exploring  all of these optimization areas, and is producing a
              battery powered  demonstration system for speech signal processing.
