Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a two-year ontinuing award.  `Distributed
              Group Support Systems` embed Group Decision Support System (GDSS)-type tools
              and procedures within a computer-mediated communication system, to support
              collaborative work among dispersed groups of people.  `Distributed` has several
              meanings: temporal, spatial and technological.  The group members use the
              system to work together to reach a decision or complete their cooperative work
              over a period of time, with each person working at whatever time and place is
              convenient.  The theoretical focus of this phase of the research program will
              be to test propositions that will contribute to a general theory of
              coordination in distributed groups, by constructing a common database of the
              results of at least six experiments spanning four different types of tasks. 
              The focus of empirical studies will be coordination mechanisms and processes to
              support creative and planning tasks, such as software design teams.  The
              products of this program of research will help to provide the knowledge base
              for effective coordination of the  work of collaborative groups using the
              `information superhighways` that are currently being constructed.
