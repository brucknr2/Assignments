Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Farley/ATM-9408441         This project is a continuation of a
              cooperative agreement to  support the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, a facility
              located near  Lima, Peru.  Activities slated for the next five years include 
              storm time equatorial and low latitude dynamics, the validation of  modern
              equatorial ionosphere models, lower thermosphere dynamics  and the effects of
              upward propagating tides and planetary wave  leakage, and many other studies. 
              Funding will also be directed  towards upgrades in this facility.
