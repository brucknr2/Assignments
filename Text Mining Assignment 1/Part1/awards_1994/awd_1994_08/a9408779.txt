Abstract    :
              9408779  Wu    A study will be carried out of the desorption of alkali metal
              ions  and hydrogen ions (protons) from the (100) surface of silicon under  the
              irradiation of low fluence pulsed laser beams.  The focus of  this
              investigation is on the case where desorption results from  valence instead of
              core level electron excitation.  The motivation  for this study is to
              understand the nature of the interaction  between photons and the surface atoms
              and to explore the  possibility of using a laser beam to modify the silicon
              surface by  selectively desorbing certain types of adsorbed atoms.  High 
              resolution time-of-flight techniques will be used to measure the  kinetic
              energy of desorbed ions.  Doppler shifted laser-induced  fluorescence
              techniques will be used to study the relation between  desorbed neutral alkali
              metal atoms and their ions.    %  %  %  %    Laser light has been shown to be
              able to deposit very fine metal  lines on semiconductor wafers.  This
              phenomenon, which is usually  referred to as laser writing, has important
              applications in  semiconductor technology.  The current investigation will
              examine  the ability of a laser beam to modify silicon surfaces by  selectively
              removing certain types of atoms adsorbed on the silicon  surface.  The initial
              study will concentrate on the simplest and  yet technologically important
              alkali metal and hydrogen adatoms.  ***
