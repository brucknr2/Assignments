Abstract    :
              9408089  ROSENBERG  This project will utilize information from internal anatomy
              and allozyme electrophoresis to determine relationships among approximately 25
              species of land snails in a genus which occurs on major islands in the West
              Indies.  These very interesting snails are terrestrial but their closest
              relatives have an amphibian existence.  The project will investigate whether
              this transition to land-dwelling has been made once, with the snails then
              dispersing to other islands, or whether there have been, instead, multiple land
              invasions with each island having been colonized separately from an amphibious
              ancestor.  %%%  This project will contribute to our knowledge of biodiversity
              in these restricted island faunas.  The snails are an excellent model system
              for investigating the transition to an existence on land and the marked
              changes, especially in the respiratory system, that must occur with such a
              major habitat shift.  Information about the geologic history of the islands
              should also emerge as patterns in relationships of the snails should reflect
              relationships or relative times of origin for the islands.  ***
