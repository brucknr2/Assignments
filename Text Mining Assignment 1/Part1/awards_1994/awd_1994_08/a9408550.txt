Abstract    :
              This project will examine adaptive synchronization protocols that  monitor the
              execution of the parallel simulator, and automatically  adapt the simulator's
              execution to optimize performance.  Adaptive  mechanisms allow the underlying
              simulation system to achieve  maximum performance, particularly for dynamically
              changing  workloads that often arise in practice.  These mechanisms can also 
              simplify the development of parallel simulation software to the  extent that
              some degree of performance "tuning" is automatically  performed by the
              simulation system, rather than by the application  programmer, who may not be
              an expert in parallel simulator  performance.    A protocol that uses memory
              allocation to control execution is  proposed.  A second problem that will be
              addressed concerns  analyzing and defining suitable incremental state saving
              methods  that are designed to execute efficiently with rollback-based  parallel
              and distributed simulators.  Both problems will be  attacked using
              experimentation on implementations running on  multiprocessor hardware, and
              analytic modeling techniques.
