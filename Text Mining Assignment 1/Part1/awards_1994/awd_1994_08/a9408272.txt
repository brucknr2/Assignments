Abstract    :
              94-08272  Sounder    An understanding of the factors underlying successful new
              product innovation and associated processes within different cultures is
              vitally important to modern managers, and equally important to today's public
              decision makers.  However, a major gap exists in our knowledge of new product
              innovation success/failure factors across multiple countries and cultures.  In
              response to this gap the Center for the Management of Science and Technology
              (CMOST) has undertaken INTERPROD, and international cross-cultural study of
              factors that distinguish new product successes from failures.  The entire
              INTERPROD study will result in a unique database of historical life cycle data
              on hundreds of factors that actually affected the success and failure outcomes
              of over 2,000 new product innovations, in over 250 firms within sixteen
              countries.  The sampling plan will be stratified by large and small firms
              within several industries, by successful and unsuccessful projects within these
              strata, and by high and low uncertainty new product development efforts.  Thus,
              the results can be analyzed across several dimensions.  A series of carefully
              designed questionnaires, telephone interviews and face-to-face interviews will
              be administered to collect the data.  This funds only Phase II of INTERPROD
              (includes Phases IIA and IIB).  The pilot Phase I has been completed using
              internally generated CMOST funds.   The decision to move on to subsequent
              phases of INTERPROD will depend on the outcome of Phase II.
