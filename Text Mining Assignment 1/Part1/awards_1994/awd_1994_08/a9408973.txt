Abstract    :
              9408973  Okunbor  Computer simulation of molecular dynamics is the study of time
               evolution of the dynamical state of a system of interacting  particles or
              bodies by the computation of trajectories of  particles based on the numerical
              integration of Newton's  equations of motion.  Many-body and many-particle
              systems arise  in several applications, such as in studies of the dynamics of 
              biological macromoleculesin drug design, in the simulation of  plasmas, in
              vehicle and space structure simulation and in  cosmology.  The dimension of
              this system of ordinary differential  equations is of the order of tens of
              thousands.  To solve such a  system requires an enormous amount of computer
              time.  This  project aims to develop cost effective and globally stable 
              algorithms for molecular dynamics simulations, with an emphasis  on schemes
              suitable for large systems.  The project concentrates  on the development of
              integration methods that would facilitate:  taking much larger step sizes
              without sacrificing accuracy,  extension of the multiple-time stepping strategy
              to higher-order  integrators and the application of Psi Calculus for
              partitioning,  scheduling and routing the arrays to the multiprocessors to cut 
              down the computation time by a significant proportion.  ***
