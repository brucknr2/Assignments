Abstract    :
              Prof. Teukolsky's group is investigating gravitational  collapse and the
              formation of black holes by solving  Einstein's equations on a supercomputer. 
              They will  determine how much gravitational radiation is emitted during  such
              events.  Some situations they will study include  collisions of star clusters
              and of black holes, and  gravitational collapse of unstable star clusters. 
              They are  also investigating the coalescence of two neutron stars in  binary
              orbit about each other, and are studying the  properties of rapidly rotating
              stars in general relativity,  and how information about the nuclear equation of
              state  might be discovered from astrophysical observations.  They  are
              exploring the formation of black holes in supernova  explosions, which are
              usually thought to produce neutron  stars and not black holes.  Finally, they
              are analyzing the  recently discovered planetary system around a pulsar to 
              provide an absolute confirmation that the system does in  fact contain planets.
                 This work will be important to elucidate possible  astronomical observations
              which can provide critical tests  of Einstein's theory of gravitation.
