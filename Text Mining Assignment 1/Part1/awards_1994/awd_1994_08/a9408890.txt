Abstract    :
              IBN-9408890  Robert Handa    A basic response of animals to stress in their
              environment is the rapid activation of the stress-responsive neuroendocrine
              systems. One such response is the activation of the
              hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Sex differences exist in the
              response of the HPA axis to stress with males responding less robustly than
              females. In both sexes, one consequence of HPA activation is an inhibition of
              reproductive function. These investigators have hypothesized that in males the
              reproductive hormone, testosterone, inhibits the HPA axis to suppress the
              deleterious effects that secretory products of the HPA axis have on
              reproduction. One mechanism by which testosterone inhibits HPA activity is by
              binding to androgen receptors in the brain. This research supported by this
              award will characterize the effects of androgen on stress-inducible indicators
              of cell activity in the brain, determine the sites within the brain where
              androgen acts to influence HPA activity, and to determine if androgen can act
              by modulating glucocorticoid receptor function. The results of these studies
              will define the mechanisms whereby androgen can act to inhibit neuroendocrine
              responses to stress and help us understand the effects of stress on
              reproductive function in both males and females.
