Abstract    :
              9408221  Yang       The main goal of this project is to investigate possible 
              applications of the inverse Kostka matrix and its combinatorial  interpretation
              in the study of symmetric functions.  Problems to  be considered include (1)
              expansion of plethysm of symmetric  functions as a sum of Schur functions, (2)
              expansion of symmetric  product   as  Schur function series, and (3) q-Schur
              function  series and its properties.  Since the expansion coefficients in 
              these problems can be expressed in terms of the inverse Kostka  matrix, it is
              expected that combinatorial properties of the  matrix, in particular, knowing
              its zero elements, can greatly  simplify the problems.  ***
