Abstract    :
              This project is designing an architecture and compiler for video  signal
              processing, with collaboration among researchers in computer  architecture,
              compilers, and signal processing.  The architecture  is a very long instruction
              word machine dedicated to the  applications, which means that a large number of
              small data paths  are used.  Address generation may receive hardware support. 
              The  compiler differs in several ways from general purpose compilers:  
              optimization is sought even at the cost of high compilation times,  and memory
              usage will be explicitly optimized.  Architecture and  compiler design are
              being evaluated by experimentation with  application codes, including video
              compression, image enhancement,  and machine vision.  The architecture is being
              simulated on a  network of high-performance workstations, while the compiler is
               being constructed based on the Gnu C compiler.  The architecture  and compiler
              will be iteratively improved to result in a high-  performance system and a set
              of design principles.
