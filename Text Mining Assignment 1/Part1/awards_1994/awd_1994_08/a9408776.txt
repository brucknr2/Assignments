Abstract    :
              9408776  Ballance      This is a symposium focusing on the materials and
              processes  used to manufacture musical instruments to be held at the  1994
              Spring Meeting of the Materials Research Society.  The  Acoustical Society of
              America is co-sponsoring this  symposium, which will be the first where
              materials  scientists and musical acousticians will be brought together  to
              discuss musical instruments.  We are expecting much  participation by
              professional instrument makers and artists  and therefore hope to promote
              communication and  collaboration between these four groups.  Among the topics 
              to be discussed at the symposium are (1) the affect the  materials used to make
              an instrument has on the sound it  produces, (2)the materials and manufacturing
              related  problems that instrument makers have and what new materials  and
              processes they are using, and (3) new or advanced  materials for instruments or
              parts of instruments to achieve  an improvement in sound quality or a reduction
              in price.  A  group of eminent scientists and instrument makers have been 
              invited to contribute to the symposium and the symposium is  being organized by
              a group that includes materials  scientists, instrument makers and an
              acoustician.    As this event is a first of its kind, the organizers feel  that
              it will be a unique opportunity for students interested  in this area to meet
              the foremost researchers and to hear  them speak.  This proposal  will provide
              funding for the  travel expenses of students.   ***
