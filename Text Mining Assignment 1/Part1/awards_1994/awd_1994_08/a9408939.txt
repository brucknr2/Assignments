Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9408939  University of Hawaii Manoa  P.I.:  Kwok Cheung      This
              project uses numerical and theoretical techniques to study the hydrodynamic
              response of a fluid membrane to gravity waves in order to understand
              fluid-membrane interaction.  Fluid-filed membranes have various environmental
              applications, including use in breakwaters and temporary storage of
              contaminated water during site remediation or at times of flooding.  In the
              modeling, and emphasis will be placed on solving problems related to large
              scale floating membrane systems.  The static equilibrium configuration of the
              fluid filed membrane will first be calculated accounting for both large
              deformations and wrinkling of the membrane.  The response of the filled
              membrane to waves will then be studied by a dynamic analysis that couples the
              finite element model with a boundary element technique.  Available experimental
              results will be used to compare with simulations.
