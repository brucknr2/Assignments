Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9408876  T. T. Kodas      A for phase segregation in
              reaction-controlled gas-phase particle production routes will be investigated,
              in order to improve the generation of nanophase multicomponent powders.  Three
              new production routes will be tested:  (i) single source precursors, (ii)
              precursors with matched reactivities, and (iii) reaction between  precursors in
              gas phase to fix stoichiometry.  The limits on phase purity, phase segregation,
              and multicomponent particle size and morphology will be determined.  The
              research approach includes the characterization of the precusors and reactor,
              gas-phase chemistry studies, aerosol dynamics studies correlated to chemistry,
              and characterization of the resulted powders.    The project is based on an
              exploratory approach, and may lead to materials with new properties tailored
              for special uses.  Metal alloys and mixed metal oxides with properties
              unavailable by other routes will be produced, with applications to
              microelectronics and high-strength coatings.
