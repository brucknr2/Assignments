Abstract    :
              9408701  Marder  This renewal award is made in the Advanced Materials and 
              Processing Program in support of the research of Dr. Seth  Marder and Dr.
              Joseph Perry. Support is provided by the  Divisions of Chemistry and Materials
              Research. The goals of the  research are to develop an understanding of the
              factors  affecting both second- and third-order nonlinearities, assess  the
              fundamental limits for the hyperpolarizability coefficients  that can be
              achieved with organic molecules and polymers, and  to develop synthetic
              strategies that will lead to molecules  where nonlinear response is optimized.
              An integrated program of  synthesis, structural, linear and nonlinear optical 
              characterization, and theoretical studies will be carried out.    Materials
              with nonlinear optical properties are key to optical  processing and storage of
              data and images. This research will  result in molecules and optical materials
              with greatly enhanced  nonlinear optical properties compared to those currently
               available.
