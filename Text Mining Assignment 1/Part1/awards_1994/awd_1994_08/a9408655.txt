Abstract    :
                     9408655  Skinner       This project involves the dissertation research of
              a  cultural anthropology student from the University of California-  Davis. 
              The student will study polygynous marriages in Ghana in  order to understand
              the division of labor in work and capital  accumulation.  The standard theory
              of polygyny accounts for it as  due to resource accumulation of men, by
              controlling the labor  power of several wives.  This case study will show how
              polygyny  works in a society where spouses are economically independent,  and
              men can not appropriate women's labor.  Using ethnographic  methods and
              analysis of divorce cases, the student will try make  an analytic model of
              polygyny that could be used cross-culturally  to explain the existence of
              alternative forms of marriage in  other areas of the world.       This research
              is important because the understanding of how  alternative marriage forms work
              in relation to the distribution  of resources between men and women will help
              us understand how to  design programs to strengthen the family and maintain it
              as the  primary unit of socialization.  This can have implications for  divorce
              and childrearing as well as for the transmission of STDs.
