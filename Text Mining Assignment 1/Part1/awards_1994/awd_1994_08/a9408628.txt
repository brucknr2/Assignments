Abstract    :
              A program to study the structure, processing, and properties of  thin-film high
              temperature superconductors using the nuclear  hyperfine technique of perturbed
              angular correlation (PAC)  spectroscopy is proposed. Transport measurements on
              the films  will complement studies of the structure of magnetic flux lines  in
              the materials. The physical structure and basic electronic  properties of
              several types of superconductors will be measured  on films synthesized under
              carefully controlled conditions. The  effects of various processing procedures
              will be evaluated. The  relationship between microscopic structural quality, as
              measured  by PAC, and the superconducting transition temperature,  resistivity
              and magnetic properties will be determined. The  proposed work will contribute
              to the understanding of the  behavior of  photoexcited high temperature
              superconductors, and  that will explore the magnetic flux lattice in these
              materials,  especially in the low field region.    A program to study the
