Abstract    :
              9408208  Jones   Within the last few years, development has emerged as a major
              theme in evolutionary biology.  Recent insights gainsed from interdisciplinary
              studies of development in animals are laying the foundation for a new synthesis
              in comparative biology.  There have been very few comparable studies in plants,
              however.  The PI will initiate a study of the developmental basis of
              differentiation in whole plant growth form in the genus Pelargonium.  This is
              an ideal group for this study because 1) species exhibit a tremendous range of
              whole plant morphology; 2) preliminary analyses of gene sequences suggest that
              historical relationships can be resolved in this group; and 3) the group is
              well studied in other respects but basic studies of developmental morphology
              are lacking.  the PI will compare morphological and histological development of
              seedlings in three species from each major lineage in the subgenus Pelargonium.
               The proposed investigation focusses on seedlings because this stage of the
              life cycle represents the earliest expression of the body plan.  Structural
              comparisons of ecologically important structures of seedlings, together with
              deduction of rules of construction expressed at later stages, will provide the
              framework for deduction of the whole plant body plan as well as assessment of
              the importance of the onset and timing of formation of water-storing and
              carbohydrate-storing tissues.
