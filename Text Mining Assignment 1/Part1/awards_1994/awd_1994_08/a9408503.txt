              Schaffer, Rice University As information about DNA sequences accumulates, it is
              becoming increasingly important to identify the location of genes or segments
              of genes.  Genetic linkage analysis is a statistical technique used to map
              genes and find their location in relation to other known segments of DNA.  The
              most popular software for doing this is called LINKAGE, but the computational
              time required to solve problems is often prohibitive.  FASTLINK, developed by
              this principle investigator, is an improved version of LINKAGE.  This award
              will support the parallelization of the FASTLINK code to substantially improve
              the computational speed,  and to improve the shared distributed memory system
              named TreadMarks, which manages the algorithms on a network of workstations.
