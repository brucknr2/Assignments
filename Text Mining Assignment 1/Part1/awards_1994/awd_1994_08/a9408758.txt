Abstract    :
              Support is sought to acquire computer equipment to enable the Department of
              Meteorology at Northern Illinois University  (NIU) to migrate from OS/2-based
              McIDAS software to UNIX stations and software.  This conversion to UNIX allows
              the  Department of Meteorology to expand the accessibility and number of
              products available from UNIDATA for both teaching  and research.  The proposal
              requests will enhance the cooperation with the existing program in Geographic
              Information  Systems (GIS) in the Department of Geography.  Two UNIX
              workstations are requested.  Presently, only one workstation  serves the entire
              department.
