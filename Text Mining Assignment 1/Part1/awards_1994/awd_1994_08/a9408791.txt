Abstract    :
              9408791  Weingarten  The Computing Research Association requests partial support
              for a  joint industry, academic, and government technical symposium to  explore
              and plan the R&D agenda for the National Information  Infrastructure (NII). 
              The symposium is a joint project of several  industry and academic groups and
              is undertaken in cooperation with  the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology and the  Committee on Technology of the Applications Committee of
              the  government's Information Infrastructure Task Force.    Funds will be used
              to partially defray travel costs of the academic  attendees and to pay for post
              forum editing and costs for  disseminating the resulting report.
