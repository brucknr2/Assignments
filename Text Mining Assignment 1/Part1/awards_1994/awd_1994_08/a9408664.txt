Abstract    :
                    9408664   John Kelley    The fossil genus Sivapithecus assumed central
              importance in  the evolution of apes and humans with the recognition that  it
              shares important characters of facial morphology with the  orang utan. 
              Recently, the interpretation of  Sivapithecus  as the sister taxon to orangs
              has been questioned on the  basis of postcranial specimens excavated from site
              311 in  the Siwalik Hills, Pakistan.  This alternative  interpretation has
              fundamental implications for our  understanding of the evolution of hominoid
              postcranial and  locomotor adaptations.    This research project will extend
              the excavations at site  311, which has produced half the known postcranial
              remains  of Sivapithecus to date, and also will survey the Hasnot  area, which
              holds considerable promise.
