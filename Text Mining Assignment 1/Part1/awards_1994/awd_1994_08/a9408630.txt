Abstract    :
                 The model elimination theorem-proving procedure, like   top-down reasoning
              procedures, has the defect of repeatedly   solving  the same  goals.  The
              problem can be ameliorated by lemmas or  caching,   but the  ``upside-down
              meta-interpretation'' approach to be    investigated offers a more 
              comprehensive solution that entails  executing the model   elimination
              procedure  by a bottom-up  reasoning engine, which also enables more   control
              over search  strategy.    Theory resolution is a framework for   incorporating
              theories into  a  resolution theorem-proving program, thereby making it   
              unnecessary to resolve  directly upon axioms of the theory and  improving
              efficiency.    Although many  ways of incorporating  theories into a resolution
              theorem   prover can be seen as  instances of theory resolution, theory
              resolution provides   little  guidance on  how to incorporate theories. 
              Predicate-and function-matching   rules and a  multilateral representation for
              residues  in partial theory   resolution are being  developed as methodologies 
              for using theory resolution.      Numerous previously  open problems in the
              theory of quasigroups  have been solved   recently by  automated reasoning
              systems such as  efficient   implementations of the  Davis-Putnam procedure. 
              In  collaboration with other   automated deduction  researchers and a 
              mathematician expert on the domain,   additional effort will be  devoted to
              obtain new results in the theory of quasigroups.
