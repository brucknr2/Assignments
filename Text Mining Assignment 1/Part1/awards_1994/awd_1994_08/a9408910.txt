Abstract    :
              Black Holes, compact binary systems, compact stars, rapidly  spinning stars and
              accretion disks, dark matter, and quantum  aspects of gravity will be studied
              analytically and  numerically.  Important sources of gravity waves might
              include rapidly  rotating compact stars that pulsate unstably.  Rapidly 
              rotating neutron stars will be studied, partly in order to  understand better
              the connection between observed features  of such objects and the behavior of
              nuclear matter.  Recently developed techniques will be used to study the 
              oscillations and stability of rapidly rotating stellar  models and accretion
              disks, in order to assess the  likelihood of detection of these phenomena.  The
              possibility  that a component of the dark matter in the galactic halo  consists
              of black holes will be studied further, in  connection with the possibility of
              observing such a  component.  A variety of analytic techniques will be 
              employed to study how one correctly describes phenomena,  including black hole
              evaporation, at the fundamental quantum  level in the presence of strong
              gravitational fields.  Particular emphasis will be placed on interactions of
              black  holes with their environment.
