Abstract    :
              Abstract - Ciric - 9408694      Traditional process synthesis involves
              optimizing the steady state economic performance of a chemical process. 
              Stability analysis and control system design are performed after the flowsheet
              structure, equipment sizes, and nominal operating parameters have been
              specified.    The objective of this work is to incorporate controllability
              issues into process design.  The idea is to use an optimization based test to
              screen out process designs that are unstable or difficult to control.  The test
              is a non-local optimization-based test of dynamic stability that asks whether a
              dynamic system will always remain within the control neighborhood.  The test is
              flexible and can be applied to systems with parameter uncertainty, to
              constrained dynamic systems, or to systems with discrete dynamic modes.  The
              work will embed this optimization-based test for stability within a larger
              optimization problem that seeks an economical design.  The PI plans to solve
              the resulting bi-level optimization problem with a dual-temperature simulated
              annealing approach.  Four specific problems will be investigated: heat
              exchanger network synthesis, heat integrated distillation systems, heat
              integrated reactor networks, and homogeneous azeotropic distillation.
