Abstract    :
              9408438  Russell  This project is on research to study the behavior of enzymes
              in  organic media by attachment of an enzyme to an organic polymer.   In
              particular, an enzyme will be fixed to a hydrophobic matrix of  polyethylene
              glycol (PEG) chains.  This would allow the enzyme to  dissolve in an organic
              solvent while maintaining activity.  The  enzyme would be attached to a polymer
              by: (1) direct  functionalization of the enzyme with an acrylate-terminal PEG
              to  produce an enzyme in an organic solvent, followed by (2) solution 
              copolymerization of the enzyme macromonomer with a vinyl monomer.   Studies of
              the enzyme stability, activity and specificity in this  environment, as well as
              studies on the effects of polymer  macrostructure on the overall kinetics of
              the enzyme-catalyzed  reaction will be performed.  Also, a study of protein
              activity as  effected by polymer porosity, enzyme loading, the extent of 
              enzyme modification prior to immobilization, polymer  hydrophobicity, other
              physical properties, and mass transfer will  be performed.  The particular
              enzyme to be used in this research  is organophosphorous hydrolase, and enzyme
              which can degrade  certain insecticides such as parathion, and certain types of
               nerve gases.  This research could have environmental impact  through the
              biodegradation of highly toxic compounds.  ***
