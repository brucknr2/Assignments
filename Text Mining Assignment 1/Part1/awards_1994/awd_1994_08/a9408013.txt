Abstract    :
                    This  study  seeks  to  understand  how  variations  in  climatic 
              conditions alter the reproductive cycles in three populations  of 
              white-crowned  sparrows  living  in  diverse  habitats  within  a  relatively 
              small area of western Washington state. The  research  will  integrate  field 
              and laboratory  studies  on  reproductive  function.  Comparisons  between 
              populations  will  be  made   of  behavior   and   reproductive  state  in  
              the   springtime   and  experimental  manipulations of environmental  cues 
              suspected  of  signaling environmental change will be performed. The long 
              range  goal  of  the project is to determine the extent and function  of 
              pathways in the brain of these animals for environmental  signals  that  
              regulate   changes  in  appearance  and   behavior.   Such  information  is
              critical to understand, in general,  how  animals  react  to  their  habitat 
              to aid us in  the  future  in  solving  problems  associated with global
              warming and habitat destruction.  Understanding  the  mechanisms  by  which 
              vertebrates  transform  environmental  information into morphological,
              physiological  and  behavioral adjustments may help us evaluate the extent  to 
              which  species  are  able  to adapt and how we may fare  in  a  changing 
              environment.
