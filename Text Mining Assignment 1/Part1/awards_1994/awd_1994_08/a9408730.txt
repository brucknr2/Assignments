Abstract    :
              9408730  Smith  The design of high-hazard structures, such as spillways on 
              major dams, is based on estimates of the Probable Maximum  Precipitation (PMP).
               The Next Generation Weather Radar  (NEXRAD) offers a wealth of radar data
              which utilization in  the analysis of severe storm events will advance the 
              understanding and measurement of extreme rainfalls and will  improve the
              procedures for assessing PMP.  The principal  objectives of the projects are:
              to characterize the spatial,  seasonal and diurnal heterogeneities in the
              occurrence of  extreme rainstorms giving special attention to storm 
              transposition and the specification of spatial and temporal  patterns of PMP;
              and to assess the accuracy of radar  rainfall estimates of extreme rainstorms. 
              The results from  this work will enhance the quality of the design of 
              emergency dam spillways and other high risk structures, and  the risk
              assessment of these structures.  ***
