Abstract    :
              This project is investigating the design, implementation, and use  of a family
              of family of massively parallel computers that use one  processor per digit.  A
              first generation design, completed in an  earlier project, contains 16,384 fine
              grain processors on a single  board.  The processors contain a small number of
              parallel logic  circuits and a configuration memory that controls the logic and
               interconnect.  The entire machine is programmed for a problem by  setting all
              configuration registers to transform the machine into  a special-purpose
              computer for the problem.  By improving the  density of processors on chips and
              the speeds of interconnect and  interface, this project is increasing the
              operation rate of the  machine by a factor of 4 to 10.  In addition to the
              design and  implementation of architectures, this project is developing both 
              high and low level programming tools for the machines.  Finally,  algorithms
              for solving compute intensive problems on these machines  are being developed
              and tested.
