Abstract    :
              9307000  Soltis       Phylogenetic analysis of variation in the chloroplast
              genome  (cpDNA) has dominated the past decade of systematic research in 
              plants.  Although there are numerous advantages of cpDNA variation  in
              retrieving phylogeny, several factors can potentially,  contribute to
              discordance between the actual organismal and cpDNA-  based phylogenies,
              including taxon density, heterogeneity of  evolutionary rates, lineage sorting,
              and chloroplast capture.   Systematists therefore concur that comparison of
              nuclear and cpDNA-  based phylogenies is critical.  This project will therefore
              address  an important need in plant systematics:  the comparison of existing 
              cpDNA-based phylogenies with those derived from nuclear gene  sequences.  The
              approach taken will be hierarchical beginning at  the species level, moving to
              closely related groups of genera, all  30 genera of Saxifragaceae sensu
              stricto, and ultimately to  associated rosid families.  Sequences will be
              obtained from the  entire internal transcribed spacer (ITS) or 18S regions of
              nuclear  ribosomal DNA (rDNA), depending on the taxonomic level of inquiry.  
              Preliminary data indicate that these regions are evolving at  appropriate rates
              for each of these taxonomic levels.       Comparison of cpDNA-and nuclear
              DNA-based phylogenies is  particularly important in groups, such as
              Saxifragaceae s.s., that  are noted for hybridization and chloroplast capture
              and for which  the cpDNA-based phylogenies may consequently be suspect.  The 
              hierarchical approach proposed may also provide new insights into  the patterns
              and phylogenetic impact of past hybridization.
