Abstract    :
              9307055  Jackson   The central objective of this project is to improve
              understanding of the   vegetation-sensing properties of sedimentary pollen
              assemblages, which are the   primary source of information on past vegetation
              in most of the world. The   research is specifically concerned with determining
              the effective pollen source   areas for important tree taxa, and understanding
              the factors that govern them.   These factors include basin size, canopy cover,
              physical properties of pollen   dispersal, and the patterning of vegetation on
              the landscape. A related objective   is to determine how these factors
              influence pollen representation in percentage   data, and to refine and test
              calibrations aimed at correcting for those effects.   Modern pollen assemblages
              from forest floor moss polsters at 130 sites in   northern New York and
              southern New England, and 25 sites in northern Arizona,   will be compared with
              vegetation composition and patterns across a range of   spatial scales. Scatter
              plots and regression analysis will be used to identify   pollen source areas
              and to estimate and test calibration parameters for relating   pollen
              percentages to forest composition.  %%%  An understanding of these factors is
              crucial to the design and interpretation of   paleoecological studies, because
              pollen source areas determine the spatial   scales at which pollen assemblages
              record information about vegetation.   Analyses of historical vegetation
              patterns are essential for understanding large-  scale vegetation response to
              climate change.  ***
