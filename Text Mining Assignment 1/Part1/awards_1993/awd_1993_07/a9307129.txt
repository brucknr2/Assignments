Abstract    :
                9307129  Edwards  The angular distribution of Auger electrons emitted by a
              molecule is a probe of  the anisotropy of the molecular field.  For gaseous
              targets it has not been  possible to discern the orientation of the molecular
              frame to study these  distributions.  A new coincidence experiment will be
              performed which will  remove this problem and will enable kinetic energy
              spectra to be studied in  coincidence with the Auger electron and allow
              measurement of the angular  distribution relative to the internuclear axis.  N2
              will be studied as a  prototypical system to demonstrate the effectiveness of
              the experimental  approach.
