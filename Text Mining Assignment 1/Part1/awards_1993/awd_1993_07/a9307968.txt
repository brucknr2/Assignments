Abstract    :
                      9307968  FONDAHL  The goals of this research are to investigate the
              evolution of  land and resource tenure systems among indigenous peoples of the 
              Russian North during the Soviet and post-Soviet periods.  Legislation and
              policy developments will be described.The study  areas represents a
              cross-section of physical and cultural  environments, political statuses and
              relative stages of  industrial development.  Methods adapted from land and
              occupancy  and subsistence surveys from the Western Arctic will be updated  to
              incorporate GIS analysis techniques. This project will offer a  timely view of
              the restructuring of property rights in the  Russian North, which is both a
              major source of raw materials and  homeland to numerous indigenous groups.  ***
