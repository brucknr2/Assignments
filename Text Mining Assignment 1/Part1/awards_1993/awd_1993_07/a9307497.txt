Abstract    :
              9307497  Schonbek       This project consists of two parts:  a)  a study of the 
              large time behavior of solutions to equations of  magnetohydrodynamics and
              multiphase flow, and an investigation of  the influence of the  nonlinear terms
              on the behavior of the  solutions in the far field.  More precisely it will be
              shown that  the nonlinear terms in frequency space produce some mixing of the 
              modes which introduce long waves that will slow down the decay;   b) a study of
              an analogue to a fluid motion on the circle, its  stability and long time
              behavior.  The expectation is that the  methods used here can be extended to
              the three dimensional  sphere.%%%       These projects analyze models of
              viscous fluid equations  which incorporate nonlinear effects.  Interest is
              focused in  understanding the behavior of the fluids as time gets large and 
              one goal is to demonstrate that the motion of such fluids take  longer in
              slowing down than the motion of fluids which are purely  dissipative.  This
              study could lead to a better understanding of  turbulence and may find
              applications in weather prediction.  ***
