Abstract    :
              9307896  Hironaka       This awards supports the research of Professor E.
              Hironaka to  work in algebraic geometry.  Topics to be studied include the 
              geometry of complex varieties, especially smooth surfaces and  embedded curves.
              In particular she hopes to find ways to compute  Betti numbers for these
              geometric objects.       The research is in the field of algebraic geometry,
              one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the 
              point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have  stood for
              centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the  plane by the simplest
              of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the  field uses methods not only from
              algebra, but also from analysis  and topology, and conversely it is extensively
              used in those  fields.  Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as
              diverse  as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding  theory
              and robotics.  ***
