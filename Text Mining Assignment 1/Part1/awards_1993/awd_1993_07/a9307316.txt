Abstract    :
              An experimental search for narrow resonances in pion  production by protons on
              nuclei near 350 MeV bombarding  energy will be carried out.  In addition
              neutral pion  production, double pion production, and radiative capture  will
              be studied using a new recoil facility being developed  for use on the IUCF
              Cooler.  Studies of proton capture  reactions with polarized beam will be
              feasible following  installation of a new high intensity polarized ion source
              at  IUCF in 1992-93.  Studies will include single and double  pion production,
              including polarization experiment, to test  new relativistic theories.  ***
