Abstract    :
              9307162  Wu    The goal of this proposed research is to develop two new  methods
              for cleaving chromosome-size DNA specifically into  large fragments in order to
              construct a contiguous physical  map of each chromosome.  These fragments will
              be used as  starting materials in producing a low-density physical map  of each
              chromosome without gaps.  The major advantage of  this method is that it will
              allow for the cleavage and  recovery of much larger DNA molecules than can be
              achieved  by the three previously published methods.    Four novel
              cleavage-specific plasmids have been designed and  two have been constructed
              for this research.  These plasmids  will be used to transform Oryza sativa
              (rice), followed by  regeneration of the resulting transgenic plants. 
              Quantitative slot-blot hybridization and genomic blot  analysis will be carried
              out to determine the copy number of  the integrated copy of the
              cleavage-specific plasmid in each  transgenic plant.  A collection of over 100
              transgenic  plants will be obtained and characterized, each with several 
              copies of the cleavage-specific plasmids integrated in a  different chromosome.
               Next, the chromosomal DNA from  different transgenic plants will be
              specifically cleaved  using a novel enzyme-based strategy, followed by 
              fractionation of the DNA using pulsed field gel  electrophoresis and
              hybridization analysis.  The final  result of this proposed research is to
              produce a contiguous,  low-density physical map, with between 2 to 7 megabases
              (mb)  in between two markers, of at least 8 out of the 12  chromosomes in rice.
