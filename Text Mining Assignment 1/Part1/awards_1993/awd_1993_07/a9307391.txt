Abstract    :
                The study of approximation algorithms for combinatorial  optimization problems
              dates back to the 1960's, and in spite  of significant  attention paid to this
              area, there has not  been much progress until the past  few years.  Recently, 
              there have been a number of important breakthroughs that  have introduced new
              techniques, both in the design and  analysis of  approximation algorithms, and
              more  significantly, in techniques for providing  evidence that  problems do
              not have efficient algorithms that guarantee  near-optimal solutions for
              particular performance  guarantees.  The  problems studied include: (a) the
              vertex cover  problem; (b) the maximum acyclic  subgraph problem; (c) the
              minimum-cost satisfiability problem;   (d) the Steiner tree problem; (e) the
              traveling salesman problem;   (f) the bin-packing problem; (g) the graph
              partitioning problem;   and (h) several scheduling problems.  In the search 
              for improved approximation  algorithms for these problems, the primary focus 
              is on  methods that rely on the use of linear programming as a tool  both  in
              the design and the analysis of the algorithm.  Also these new techniques for 
              proving nonapproximability results are applied in a variety of settings; in 
              particular:  (1) proving lower bounds on the absolute error of approximation 
              algorithms (as opposed to the relative error); and (2) strengthening  lower
              bounds (where traditional methods were able    to prove lower bounds that did
              not match  the performance of the best known approximation algorithms).
