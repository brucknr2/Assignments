Abstract    :
              9307197  Behringer    A largely experimental investigation is to be carried out
              of  natural convection in porous media, complemented by numerical  simulations.
               The main thrust of the research is to further  explore and exploit a novel
              non-invasive diagnostic technique  called the Modified Shadowgraph Technique
              (MST).  Specially  arranged porous materials can be made to admit optical
              signals  without refractive attenuation.  This technique can then  visualize
              convective patterns.  Unexpected flow patterns in such  media are to be further
              investigated, and the utility of the  technique for binary mixtures will be
              explored.    Beyond further developing this new tool for generating more and 
              better insight into porous media flow, the investigation is also  relevant to
              the important phenomenon of large scale flow pattern  sensitivity to material
              microstructure.  Application is to  variety of environmental and engineering
              systems.  ***
