              Massachusetts Institute of Technology  "Research in Networked Multimedia
              Information Services"      This award supports a two-year project to conduct
              research on the  development of infrastructure, programs, standards and
              policies relating to  networked multimedia information services using the
              Internet.  The  participants are MIT, Dartmouth College and Medical School, and
              Carnegie  Mellon.    A network services operations center using existing
              broadcast-quality  production and editing facilities is being created at MIT. 
              Multimedia  servers are located in this center for the storage and delivery on
              demand  of a wide variety of multimedia programming and services to the
              desktops of  engineers, scientists, health care professionals, managers and
              students.  Industry is providing the servers and related equipment.  MIT is
              developing  the programs and leading the effort.  Dartmouth is providing
              medical and  health care services.  MIT and Carnegie Mellon are researching
              standards  and policy issues.  Turner Broadcasting is making available the CNN
              daily  Newsroom program for use on the network.  Additional contributions
