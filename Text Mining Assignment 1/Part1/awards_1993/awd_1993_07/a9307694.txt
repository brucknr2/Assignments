Abstract    :
              9307694  Goodnight       In recent years the effect of interactions among genes
              on  evolution in structured populations has received increased  attention. 
              This is due to an appreciation of the ubiquity of  structured populations,
              along with several recent studies that  demonstrate that in subdivided
              populations gene interactions can  have unique evolutionary consequences%%%%   
                 This research is a theoretical study using analytical and  numerical
              approaches to investigate the effects of population  structure, genetic drift,
              and selection when there are gene  interactions.  The analytical modes will
              examine the effects of  genetic drift on the distribution of genetic variance
              in subdivided  populations.  Numerical simulation will be used to explore the 
              effects of selection in subdivided populations.  In addition, the  simulations
              will be used to examine the role of gene interaction in  the process of
              speciation.***
