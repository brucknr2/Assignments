Abstract    :
                   This research involves several problems in the study of                   
              stochastic measure-valued processes, processes which model the                 
              spatial distribution and time development of a large population.               
              The problems are concerned with the general formulation of these               
              processes and with their connection, via de Finetti's theorem,                 
              with exchangeable systems of interacting particles.                            
                   This research studies processes which arise in population                 
              genetics.  In particular, the work involves studying                           
              generalizations of the specific models used in population                      
              genetics and identifying their connections to interacting                      
              particles systems.
