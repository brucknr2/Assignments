Abstract    :
              This project in the area of analytical and surface chemistry                   
              involves the study of interfacial protein electrochemistry.  It                
              is a renewal grant which will extend Professor Bowden's                        
              research program into the area of fundamental investigations of                
              electron transfer mechanisms on gold electrodes coated with                    
              organothiolate self-assembled monolayer films.  The goal is to                 
              further our understanding of long-range electron transfer                      
              processes in biological systems.  The adsorbed proteins                        
              proposed for study will serve as the electrochemical analogs of                
              protein/protein compexes.  Thus, the experimental results will                 
              help to elucidate electronic coupling mechanisms between                       
              enzymes and electronically conducting materials.

              Professor Bowden and his students will use both electrochemical                
              and spectroscopic techniques to study biological electron                      
              transfer processes with electrodes coated with a thin film of                  
              organic material.  The objective of the research is to model                   
              protein/protein interactions in biological systems.  The                       
              results will be of value for the design of new biological                      
              probes and sensors.
