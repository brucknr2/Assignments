Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded under a Research Initiation Award, numerical                            
              simulations will be carried out of the turbulent transport of                  
              both heat and chemical species. The issue is differential                      
              diffusion, in which the molecular transport rates of heat,                     
              species, and momentum are different. In the presence of                        
              turbulence, these differential diffusion effects are important                 
              but poorly understood and little investigated. The approach is                 
              via Direct Numerical Simulations based on spectral methods.                    
                                                                                             
              The research has application to turbulent combustion, and                      
              mixing of chemical species in reactors.
