Abstract    :
                   Hislop will continue his study of the interplay of effective              
              geometry and spectral properties.  The first part of the project               
              concerns spectral and transport properties of random media.  He                
              will investigate Anderson localization for a family of continuous              
              random Hamiltonians and for Maxwell's equations in disordered                  
              media.  The second part of the project will concentrate on                     
              infinite volume hyperbolic manifolds.  He will complete the                    
              characterization of the Eisenstein series and S-matrix for                     
              geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds.                                     
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
