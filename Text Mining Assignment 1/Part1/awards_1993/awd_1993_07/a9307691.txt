Abstract    :
              The 37th annual meeting of the Wind River Conference on Procaryotic            
              Genetics, is being held at the Wind River Ranch, Estes Park,                   
              Colorado June 5-9, 1993.  This conference is primarily concerned               
              with the biology and molecular biology of genetic exchange systems             
              in a variety of procaryotic and eukaryotic systems, and is the                 
              major annually occurring meeting devoted to this subject area                  
              internationally.  One significant feature of these meetings is                 
              their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral                     
              students, whose travel funds frequently are limited.  Specifically             
              to address this problem, funds are being provided to partially                 
              support travel and scholarships to facilitate the attendance of                
              graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various                
              areas of genetic exchange and related subject areas.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              This is the major meeting in the United States where gene exchange             
              is discussed for a wide variety of microorganisms.
