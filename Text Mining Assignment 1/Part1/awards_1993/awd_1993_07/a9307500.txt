Abstract    :
              9307500  Butler  The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry 
              Division is supporting Dr. Laurie Butler's work at the  University of Chicago
              on chemical reactions in which failure of  the adiabatic approximation is
              significant in determining the  branching between chemical reaction channels. 
              Experiments  include photodissociation in Woodward-Hoffmann forbidden 
              reactions, intermediate excitation of a parent molecule to  alter its relative
              transition probabilities, and excitation to  specific vibrational levels near
              the transition state.  %%%  Most of our understanding of the detailed mechanism
              of chemical  reactions is based on the assumption that the motions of nuclei 
              and electrons can be considered separately.  This project deals  with reactions
              in which that assumption is inadequate.  The  results will lead to a more
              general theory of reaction  processes.  ***
