Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT

              XXIV Interamerican Congress of Psychology which will bring                     
              together American and South American behavioral and social

              these scientists to share their research experiences as well as a              
              chance to initiate collaborations amoung and between scientists of             
              diverse nations.
