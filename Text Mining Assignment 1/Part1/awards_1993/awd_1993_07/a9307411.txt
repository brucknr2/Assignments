Abstract    :
              9307411  Sorooshian  Advances in radar spatial resolution and rain gage
              technology  have been found inadequate for flash flood forecasting raising 
              questions about the reliability of existing warning systems.  This project will
              addressed the hydrometeorological issues  relevant to the flash flood
              phenomena, particularly as it  pertains to the relationship between rainfall
              and water shed  characteristics, and the resulting flooding.  The work will 
              develop a quantitative understanding of rainfall characteristics  pertinent to
              rainfall-runoff forecasting; will evaluate the space-  time resolution of
              rainfall sensors, both radar and gage, on  rainfall-runoff simulations; will
              improve understanding of how  hydrologic characteristics that can cause
              flooding; and will  increase the knowledge on how the requirements for minimum 
              spatial resolution of rainfall data varies regionally, and with  storm and
              watershed characteristics.  The advances in knowledge  will benefit flash flood
              mitigating efforts which every year  causes substantive life and economic
              losses.  ***
