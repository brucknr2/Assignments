Abstract    :
              9307318  Hale         In this work, molecular models, effective atom-atom 
              potentials, and Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics computer  simulations are
              used to examine the state, structure, vibrational  spectrum, and free energy of
              formation of small ice/water systems  and to develop reliable macroscopic
              models for the prediction of  ice formation rates at low temperatures
              characteristics of cirrus  cloud ice and stratospheric ice.  The projects in
              this proposal are  directed at determining the physical characteristics of
              small ice  particles at low temperatures and of small binary water-sulfuric 
              acid clusters.  The projects proposed are:  (1) a study of  "effective surface
              tensions" for small H2O clusters at low  temperatures (-20oC to -80oC); (2) a
              study of the state (liquid  versus solid) and the infrared vibrational spectrum
              of small H2O  clusters at low temperatures; (3) a study of small water-sulfuric
               acid clusters, with the major emphasis devoted to developing a  tractable
              model for H2O-H2SO4 interactions; and (4) a study of ice  formation in four to
              eight monolayers of H2O on a model substrate.  ***
