Abstract    :
                   The research entails studies of analytic and topological                  
              properties of classes of minimal surfaces in Riemannian manifolds              
              of dimension greater than or equal to 3.  The methods are                      
              primarily those of geometric measure theory and are expected to                
              achieve further insight to the analytic and topological                        
              structures of hypersurfaces lying in these manifolds.  Particular              
              attention will be paid to dimension 3 where new techniques are                 
              applied to show that certain Riemann surfaces can be realized as               
              minimal types.
