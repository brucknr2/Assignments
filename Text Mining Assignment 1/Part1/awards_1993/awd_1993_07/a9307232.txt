Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed investigation is to address                      
              fundamental issues related to the cooling of high temperature,                 
              high heat flux surfaces by liquid jet impingement. In recent                   
              years such cooling methods have been widely used in the                        
              processing of primary metals such as steel and aluminum. Of                    
              concern is the delineation of regions associated with single                   
              phase forced convection, forced convection nucleate boiling,                   
              and film boiling on a heated plate exposed to a single jet of                  
              an array of jets. Local heat transfer measurements will be                     
              used to determine convection coefficients in single and two-                   
              phase flow regimes. Parameters to be studied include                           
              hydrodynamic and geometrical features of the jet and jev                       
              arrays. To assess the applicability of basic results inferred                  
              from laboratory studies, models that use laboratory-generated                  
              data to predict the thermal response of strip steel under mill                 
              conditions will be developed, and predictions will be compared                 
              to mill data provided by the steel industry.
