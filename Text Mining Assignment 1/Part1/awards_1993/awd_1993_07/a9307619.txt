Abstract    :
              9307619               Ellis                  This project addresses an area of
              coordination technology called  workflow systems --- systems which facilitate
              the description,  modeling, enactment, and coordination of structured work
              processes  by groups of people.  These systems assist and mediate 
              communication, interaction, understanding, and synchronization  among
              collaborating processes within organizations.  Workflow  techniques have
              existed for decades but, despite progress in many  areas, intelligent,
              industrial strength workflow systems are not  well established; the models
              themselves are too restrictive and the  systems lack flexibility, built-in
              intelligence, distribution, and  a solid theoretic foundation.  To advance the
              state of the  technology, this research has two objectives:  (1) the evolution
              of  a mathematical family of models for description and analysis of 
              organizational activity, and (2) the development of system  architectures to
              support the enactment of organizational  workflow.The models must enable
              expression of goals, temporal  constraints, dynamic change, and exception
              handling.  The systems  must enable execution of dynamic, goal-based models;
              provide  coordination and assistance to users at each opportunity; and take 
              advantage of distributed computer systems technology.  The method  to be
              employed for this research will include prototyping efforts,  methodology
              development, and studies of work in selected offices.   The final outcome of
              the research will be a solid foundation  consisting of a family of models,
              architectures, and methodologies  for the development of future workflow
              systems.
