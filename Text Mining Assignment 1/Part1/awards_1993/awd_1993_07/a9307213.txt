Abstract    :
              9307213  Reno       Research in the phenomenology of elementary particle physics
               at high energy colliders will focus on processes due to the  electromagnetic
              and weak interactions.  Strong interaction  corrections to these processes are
              large.  Using the theory of  Quantum Chromodynamics to compute strong force
              corrections,  detailed comparisons between theory and experiments will be 
              performed.  Theoretical predictions for processes observed in  collider
              experiments are fundamental to increasing our  understanding of the strong,
              weak and electromagnetic  interactions.  ***
