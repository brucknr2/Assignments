Abstract    :
                9307677  Horowitz    Much recent research in econometrics has been concerned
              with  developing semi- and nonparametric methods of inference in order  to
              reduce the number of a priori and, often, untestable  assumptions needed for
              inference and, thereby, reduce the  potential for incorrect inference due to
              erroneous assumptions.   The project aims at extending semi- and nonparametric
              methods in  several ways that have important in applications.  These include 
              the semi- and nonparametric estimation of transformation models,  models with
              errors in the data, and panel data with attrition.   New methods will be
              developed that have important economic  applications.    The project developed
              new methods and economic applications in  the following areas:  (1)  Estimation
              of a regression model with an unknown  transformation of the dependent
              variable;  (2)  Nonparametric estimation of regression models with errors in 
              the data;  (3)  Nonparametric estimation of the effects of attrition on 
              inferences derived from panel data;  (4)  Use of bootstrap-based critical
              values for the test of  overidentifying restrictions on generalized-method-of
              moment  (GMM) estimation; and  (5)  Bandwith selection for certain
              semiparametric and  nonparmetric estimators.  ***
