Abstract    :
                   Herbst will conduct research in the area of partial                       
              differential equations in quantum mechanics.  The problems to be               
              considered concern scattering theory and the asymptotic behavior               
              of solutions to the Schrodinger equation which describe bound                  
              particles.  The former work will involve eigenfunction expansions              
              diagonalizing N-particle Hamiltonians and the investigation of                 
              the scattering theory of homogeneous potentials of degree zero.                
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
