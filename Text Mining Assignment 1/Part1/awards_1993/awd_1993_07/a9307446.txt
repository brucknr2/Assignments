Abstract    :
                   The three principal investigators, together with junior                   
              faculty, postdocs, and graduate students, do research on a wide                
              variety of problems in geometry, topology, and analysis.  Some of              
              the topics currently under investigation include symbolic                      
              dynamics, gauge theory, wave equations, topological quantum field              
              theory, and index theory.  Much of the work has direct ties to                 
              ideas in theoretical physics, specifically to dynamical systems                
              and quantum field theory.
