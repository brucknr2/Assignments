Abstract    :
                   The research entails the geometric aspects of Lie group                   
              theory to fundamental problems in quantum field theory and other               
              branches of mathematical physics.  One particular component of                 
              the research applies to the structure of the recently discovered               
              Carbon-60 molecule (Fulerene).  Such investigations will have                  
              potential applications to materials theory and molecular                       
              chemistry.
