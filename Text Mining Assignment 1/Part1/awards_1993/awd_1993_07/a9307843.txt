Abstract    :
              9307843 Naaman This proposal aims at pursuing the development of a high energy
              absorbing joint for precast concrete structures in seismic zones.  The joint is
              made from high performance fiber reinforced cement based composites (HPFRC)
              such as high fiber content fiber reinforced concrete and SIFCON (Slurry
              Infiltrated Fiber Concrete).  The joint is designed to act as an energy
              dissipating connector between the beam and the column elements.  The use of
              high fiber content in the matrix of the joint is meant to insure high
              ductility, increased energy absorption, reduced spalling, and superior shear
              resistance during load reversals.  The immediate objective of the research is
              to understand the fundamental mechanisms that control the properties of the
              joint and its response under monotonic and cyclic loads.  An experimental and
              an analytical programs are planned.  In the experimental program, two types of
              tests are proposed.  The first is designed to identify the bond shear stress
              versus slip characteristics of reinforcing bars embedded in HPFRC; the other is
              to clarify the response of these composites, under monotonic and cyclic shear
              loading, with and without dowel reinforcement.  The analytical program aims at
              developing a model to predict the hysteretic moment rotation response of the
              joint using the constitutive properties of the two main component materials and
              their interface.  This study should eventually lead to designing joints with
              optimized ductility and energy absorbing properties. ***
