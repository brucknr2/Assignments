Abstract    :
              9307655  Gilbert       This project will develop adaptive tools for decomposing 
              function spaces that extend methods from Fourier analysis and  wavelet theory. 
              Specific functions are to be analyzed through  the selection of a particular
              wavelet well-adapted to the  function.  Criteria for choosing the matched
              wavelet come from  the specific application which creates the function. 
              Families of  analyzing wavelets will be designed having specific smoothness 
              and decay properties needed for establishing such optimization  criteria. 
              Frame decompositions will also be studied in  vector-valued settings in
              relation to extensions of the affine  group and corresponding representation
              theory.  This work will  draw on a theory, developed recently which relates the
               generalized Cauchy- Riemann systems to unitarizable  representations of groups
              containing the affine group.  A  particularly relevant example, previously
              studied by Torresani,  is the semidirect product of the affine group with the
              Heisenberg  group.  Corresponding frame decompositions will incorporate 
              aspects of both the short-time Fourier transform and wavelet  expansions.      
               Mathematical research focusing on wavelets and  frame decompositions has its
              roots in classical harmonic analysis  but derives its recent impetus from
              studies in signal  processing. Here, the wavelet concept has proved remarkably 
              effective in analyzing signals composed of both stationary and  transient
              features.  Traditional Fourier methods have not been  effective tools in these
              studies.  Applications to research on  acoustics, data compression and partial
              differential equations  has already proven the worth of the newly developing
              ideas.  ***
