Abstract    :
                   This award covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics and Astroparticle Physics Research by a small group at                 
              Berkeley.  The group proposes to exploit Atomic Force                          
              Microscopy measurements of track etch detectors to search for                  
              various candidate particles for the "Dark Matter" in the                       
              Cosmos.  The searches will be sensitive to a broad class of                    
              weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS) that have been                    
              suggested in the theoretical astrophysics literature.
