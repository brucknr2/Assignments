Abstract    :
                   The proposed project is to establish pointwise estimates for              
              classical solutions to nonlinear viscoelasticity with fading                   
              memory, and to study the local existence, global existence and                 
              asymptotic behavior of weak solutions to the same model with                   
              special but important discontinuous initial data.
