Abstract    :
              CTS-9307518  Kentucky Research Foundation  D. Allen Butterfield    ABSTRACT   
              Methods for the immobilization of enzymes often lead to reduced activity due to
              conformational changes, unfavorable orientations and other factors. A new
              technique for more specific and uniform attachment with spacers will be
              explored in this project on membrane bioreactors.  Site-directed mutagenesis is
              to be used in modifying the genetic code for a cysteine residue and then
              expressing the variant enzyme (subtilsin).  Functional groups at one terminus
              of the spacer compound will be reacted with amino or hydroxyl moieties in a
              polymeric membrane while the other terminus will contain a thiol to be oxidized
              to the disulfide in completing the immobilization.  The immobilized enzyme and
              intermediate structures will be characterized by NMR, x-ray fluorescence,
              spin-label studies, and other methods.  Catalytic behavior is to be examined
              under various reaction conditions including aqueous and organic solvents.   
              Immobilization of enzymes facilitates a continuous mode of operation and aids
              the purification of bioproducts.  This fundamental research could help improve
              the production processes in many biotechnology companies.
