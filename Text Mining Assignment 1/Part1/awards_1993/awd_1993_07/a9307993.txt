Abstract    :
              9307993  Winey    Adhesives, photoresists, impact modifiers, packaging
              materials, and  emulsifying agents are among the industrial uses of copolymers.
                Copolymers contain two or more types of monomer units covalently  bonded to
              one another in a single polymer chain.  The different  monomer units of the
              copolymer can be arranged in a variety of  sequences, for example, random,
              alternating, and block.   Traditionally, researchers have assumed that the
              sequence  distribution does not influence macroscopic properties, except in 
              the case of very large sequencing differences, for example random  versus block
              copolymers.  However, a few studies, including work by  the authors, have
              demonstrated that small differences in the  sequence distribution dramatically
              influence blend miscibility.    Given these unexpected results, a thorough
              investigation of the  effect of sequence distribution on thermodynamics and
              mechanical  properties will be carried out.  The pertinent topics are the phase
               behavior in copolymer/homopolymer/homopolymer blends and the  interfacial
              properties of copolymer confined between immiscible  phases.  Both blend
              miscibility and interfacial fracture toughness  will be studied primarily as a
              function of the sequence  distribution of the copolymer, though considerable
              attention will  also be given to the interaction parameter and molecular
              weights.   The sequence distribution in copolymers will be explored as a new 
              means of effectively tailoring properties by varying the molecular  structure.
