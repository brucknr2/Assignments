Abstract    :
              Archaeologists have constructed a broad overview of the culture                
              history of the Labrador Inuit using archaeological and                         
              ethnohistorical data, and have identified environmental,                       
              historical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors that might                  
              have affected cultural developments during the past 600 years. Of              
              particular interest has been the evolution of distinctive 18th                 
              century communities characterized by large centrally located                   
              settlements with communal houses, long-distance trade networks,                
              explicit displays of wealth and strong leadership. Different                   
              hypotheses have been posed to explain this development including               
              climate change, population growth, and socioeconomic changes                   
              growing out of contact with Europeans. This three-year excavation              
              project is designed to test these hypotheses using settlement                  
              materials. The results will contribute to our knowledge of                     
              climate change and human adaptation in the Arctic and relate to                
              global change issues.
