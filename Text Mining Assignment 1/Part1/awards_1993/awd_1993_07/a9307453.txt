Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Computerized educational software holds promise as a                      
              supplemental means of providing individualized instruction.                    
              The Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) study                    
              established the technical basis for proceeding with the Phase II               
              research by demonstrating that it is possible to develop a                     
              working game that entails the combination of a well-designed                   
              intelligent tutoring system rooted in cognitive psychology with a              
              game format.  The objectives of the Phase II research focus on                 
              (1) filling in and experimentally testing the Phase I Intelligent              
              Tutoring Game (ITG) framework in order to provide feedback as to               
              the soundness of the teaching concepts upon which the framework                
              of the project is based; and (2) developing and experimentally                 
              testing a full-scale ITG for middle school probability and                     
              statistics/scientific reasoning in order to assess the soundness               
              of implementing the instructional approach of the project in an                
              ITG format.  The project aims to provide the students using the                
              software with the benefits of individualized instruction in a                  
              game environment that maintains student interest and enthusiasm.               
                                                                                             
              While there exist games that are poor tutors and tutors that are               
              poor games, i.e., they are no fun, the proposed project would                  
              fill this gap by developing a research-based framework to develop              
              tutors that excel both from instructional and enjoyment                        
              perspectives.
