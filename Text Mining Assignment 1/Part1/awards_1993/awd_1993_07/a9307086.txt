Abstract    :
                   Zuckerman will investigate topological conformal field                    
              theory.  He will study the algebraic structures that are                       
              naturally defined in the state space of a TCFT.  He will also                  
              investigate TCFT as a broad class of models that include the                   
              conformal string backgrounds.  Khesin will continue to                         
              investigate the role of the Virasoro Lie algebra and Lie group in              
              one dimensional fluid dynamics and two dimensional nonlinear wave              
              propagation.  He will also pursue his study of higher analogs of               
              the Poisson bracket algebra associated to the Virasoro Lie                     
              algebra.                                                                       
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
