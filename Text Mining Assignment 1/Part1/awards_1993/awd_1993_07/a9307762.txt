Abstract    :
              9307762 Ernst          Dr. Ernst will carry out a program of research in
              mathematical gravitational physics.  He will employ techniques devised by I.
              Hauser and himself to determine the spacetime distortion that takes place when
              arbitrarily specified gravitational plane waves collide, and to determine the
              spacetime curvature associated with spinning masses when the gravitational
              potential is specified arbitrarily on the axis of rotation.  He will also study
              the possible application of similar techniques to physical problems that are
              less idealized.  Purely analytical methods will be supplemented by numerical
              computation and graphical display whenever the complexity of the problem
              demands such an approach.          The attempt to solve ever more realistic
              gravitational problems using the general theory of relativity should continue
              to spawn new mathematical techniques that can be applied as well to other
              nonlinear physical theories, and which should provide a deeper insight into
              nonlinear phenomena in general. ***
