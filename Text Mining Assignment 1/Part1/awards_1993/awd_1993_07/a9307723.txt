Abstract    :
              9307723  Sangani    The proposed research is to study in detail flows of bubbly
              liquids  at large Reynolds number and of gas-solid suspensions at vanishing 
              small Reynolds number and finite Stokes number.  These flows are  known to
              exhibit a number of distinct flow patterns depending upon  flow rates and
              physical properties of the individual phases and the  flow configuration.  A
              combination of theoretical concepts of  statistical mechanics and numerical
              simulations of the appropriate  equations will be used to:  (i) obtain a
              reliable set of averaged  equations for describing these flows, including the
              closure and  constitutive relations to be used in such equations; (ii) study
              the  nonlinear growth of incipient instability of their uniform states  leading
              to transitions to slug flows and bubbly fluidized beds; and  (iii) search for
              mechanisms that stabilize the uniform state of  bubbly liquids and gas-solid
              fluidized beds.    The techniques to be developed for computing hydrodynamic 
              interactions between bubbles and liquid, or between solid and gas,  are
              expected toprovide the background for studying a variety of  engineering
              problems that arise in industrial processes for  dispersions and composites.
