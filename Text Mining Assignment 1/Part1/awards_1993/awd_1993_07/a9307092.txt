Abstract    :
              9307092 Johnson The biosynthesis of inositol is temporally and spatially
              controlled in    Arabidopsis       thaliana   .  Because    Arabidopsis    is
              an excellent organism for experiments in classical and molecular genetics,
              aspects of the genetic control of inositol metabolism can be defined using
              molecular genetics to study the pivotal biosynthetic enzyme, myoinositol 1
              phosphate synthase (MI 1 Psynthase) EC5.5.1.4, which converts glucose 6
              phosphate to inositol 1 phosphate and the pivotal catabolic enzyme, myo
              inositol oxygenase EC1.13.99.1, which catalyzes the first step in the inositol
              oxidation pathway.  Studies of these enzymes and the genes that encode them
              will contribute to the basic understanding of the genetic regulation of
              metabolic processes in plants. The long term objective of the research is to
              define, mechanistically, the genetic control of inositol metabolism in higher
              plants.  Specifically, the work outlined in this proposal will 1)study (using
              the cloned    Arabidopsis    MI 1 Psynthase gene) mechanism(s) involved in the
              regulated expression of MI 1 P synthase, 2) locate MI 1 Psynthase subcelluarly
              and 3) isolate the inositol oxygenase and its structural gene from   
              Arabidopsis   . %%%   Elucidation of mechanisms involved in the genetic
              regulation of inositol metabolism is important for understanding plant growth
              and development.  Inositol, a ubiquitous component of eukaryotic cells, plays a
              vital role in the biochemistry and physiology of plants. ***
