Abstract    :
              9307693  Konigsberg    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Lyle
              Konigsberg will  curate a large series of Native American skeletal materials 
              excavated from sites in the midwest. Because they are not  associated with
              named tribes this series is not subject to  repatriation and provides an
              extremely important data base for  scientific research. The materials are
              currently stored in less  than optimal conditions and have not been entered
              into a  computer  inventory. This current project will remedy these defects. 
              Materials will be moved to a new storage area, properly packed in  new boxes
              and placed in closed storage units. Labels will be  recopied and the data
              entered into a computerized data base.    Human osteological collections
              provide an irreplaceable resource  for documenting and studying humankind's
              past history. Nowhere is  the value of this material greater than in those
              cases where there  are no known living descendant groups, and as a consequence
              the  history of a past people has become faded or unknown. Materials  such as
              these, because they were collected through controlled  archaeological
              excavation are also important for what they reveal  about human biological
              adaptation. Through integration into a  larger cultural context, it is possible
              to examine how people  respond biologically to varying diet social organization
              and  environmental conditions.     This project is important because it will
              both preserve valuable  scientific materials and make them available for 
              research.
