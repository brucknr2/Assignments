              is an ethnographic examination of the role of apprenticeship in inculcating
              social and moral values.  It asks how far apprenticeship, beyond transferring
              technical knowledge, also reinforces or redirects social values initially
              learned at home.  The project will also critically examine the proposition that
              apprenticeships may allow youths to learn ne w interactional skills and so to
              widen their social networks beyond those of their parents, thereby managing the
              transition to an urban economy under conditions of sometimes rapid change.     
                  The research site will be the Cretan coastal town of Rethemnos.  Crete is
              stereotypically regarded throughout Greece as the locus of both stern
              traditionalizing and extreme anti authoritarianism.  It is thus idea for
              exploring tensions between deference and insubordination in social ideology and
              practice.          The principal types of data to be collected, and the methods
              of collection and analysis, are both diachronic (biographies and genealogies)
              and synchronic (interviews), and also include videotaped artisan apprentice
              interactions.  For comparative purposes, biographies will be broken down into
              thematic units, yielding a clearer account of the idealized models of
              interactions.  The resultant data will be correlated with key social variables,
              including age, gender, origin, political affiliation, professions, and work
              status.  The genealogies should help to determine the reasons for the apparent
              avoidance of employing kin on the father's side, as well as the extent to which
              artisan represent an endogamous social class.  The segment of the project
              devoted to videotaping aims to identify clearly marked signs of deference and
              insubordination in the working relationship between artisans and their
              apprentices.          The research thus explores insubordination within a
              culture where authority is the object of unrelenting competition, in a way that
              goes beyond uncritical acceptance of social actors' often formulaic claims
              about inequality and the abuse of power.  In this way, it should also shed
              critical light on the processes that have created some of the most familiar
              stereotypes in the ethnography of southern Europe.  Finally, it will identify
              the practical rather than merely the ideal meanings actors attributed to social
              categories by examining the use of cultural markers such as gesture and langua
