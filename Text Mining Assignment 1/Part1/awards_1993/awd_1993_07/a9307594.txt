Abstract    :
              Zhu         This project is a study of processor allocation and task  scheduling
              for mesh-connected multicomputers.  Parallel  applications submitted to a mesh
              system need to be gang-scheduled  on dedicated processors, which may be
              required to form a special  structure, such as a submesh.  This project is
              investigating both  theoretical and practical aspects of mesh allocation and 
              scheduling, using a three-phase approach.  The three phases are:  1.     to
              develop strategies for generalized processor allocation  to satisfy various
              application specifications;  2.     to devise and evaluate scheduling
              algorithms by adopting  two- and three-dimensional packing heuristics; and  3. 
                 to apply the algorithms to practical systems.
