Abstract    :
              9307169  Pavlis       Most tectonic processes are ultimately driven by plate 
              motions, however the tie between the two is generally  obscure except in the
              simplest cases.  Recent work in the  Chugach Metamorphic Complex of Alaska
              suggests that the  history of the complex is intimately tied not only to ridge 
              subduction but to a North Pacific plate reorganization that  changed the plate
              configuration in the vicinity of  the  subducting ridge.  This hypothsis will
              be tested in this  project by three dimensional structural analysis, 
              geochronology and geochemical techniques.  Results have  important implications
              for early Cenozoic North Pacific  plate reconstructions that ultimately ended
              with demise of  the Kula plate.  In addition it offers the opportunity to 
              examine deep seated processes that accompany ridge-trench-  ridge triple
              junction interactions that involves a highly  oblique component on one limb of
              the triple junction.
