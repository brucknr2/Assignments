Abstract    :
              9307786 Makowski X ray and neutron diffraction from partially ordered, partially
              oriented specimens have the potential to provide detailed structural
              information about biological structures that cannot be obtained by any other
              method.  Macromolecules that form fibrous, one dimensional assemblies or
              membranous two dimensional assemblies are often difficult to crystallize, and
              when they do form crystals, may do so in conformations different from that in
              the assembly.  Structural characterization of these assemblies is essential to
              understanding their functions.  The goal of this project is to expand the range
              of macromolecular assemblies amenable to detailed structural analysis, and to
              define the limits to which structural analysis can determine their structures. 
              Towards that end, a number of methods will be developed and will be tested
              using data from the filamentous bacteriophage M13, its isomorphous derivatives,
              mutants and variants.  The extensive base of biophysical data available on this
              phage particle provides a unique opportunity for the testing of new methods on
              an important biological assembly. %%% New methods for the study of
              macromolecular assemblies using x ray and neutron diffraction will be developed
              and tested using the filamentous bacteriophage M13 as a test system.  M13 is
              extensively used as a cloning vector, and as a vehicle for the display of
              foreign peptides.  Insertion mutants of M13 now being developed will be used in
              the future for a diverse set of biotechnological applications ranging from
              bioremediation to vaccines.  Understanding the structure of M13 will provide a
              basis for the design of new strains of M13 for use in this phage display
              technology.   This project will result in basic structural information about
              M13 that will aid in the development of new viral particles with great
              potential for use in technological applications. ***
