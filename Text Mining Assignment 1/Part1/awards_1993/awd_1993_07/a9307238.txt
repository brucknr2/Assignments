Abstract    :
              Renardy  9307238    This chemical research thermal project concerns the shape of
              the  interface separating two immiscible liquids in chemical and  thermals
              systems.  Two-fluid exhibit phenomena which are totally  unexpected from a
              knowledge of one-fluid flows and form a  subject rich in interdisciplinary
              science.  Industrial  applications include the formation of bicomponent fibers
              such as  nylons and the production of photographic films.  Theoretically, 
              there are often many possibilities for the shape of the boundary  separating
              the two fluids.  In addition, experiments show that  some shapes are preferred
              over others, so that the selection  mechanisms should be investigated with the
              goal of lessening the  gap between theoretical prediction and experimental
              results.   The effect of dissolved additives and temperature gradients, and 
              the consideration of heat and mass transfer at an interface are  important in
              many chemical processes.  Physical modeling,  analytical and computational
              techniques will be used by the  proposer to study the stability of various
              interface shapes, and  the appearance of new arrangements from unstable ones. 
              The  mechanical properties of composite materials are strongly  dependent on
              interface shapes.  Thus, an understanding of the  effects of the component
              properties on interface shape is of  practical importance.  ***
