Abstract    :
              9307914  Whitaker       The investigator develops accurate methods for modeling
              the  interface between fluids of different viscosities, based on  volume
              fractions.  The methods are developed with the goal of  handling harder
              problems such as fluid flow around an obstacle.   Also, statistical equilibrium
              theories of coherent structures in  turbulence are explored using numerical
              methods.  The approach  used here is based on maximizing an entropy subject to
              the  conserved quantities of the flow.  This formulation is based on  the
              Euler's equations.  The investigator has also recently  developed a model of
              DNA which will be compared to actual DNA in  nature.  This model will be used
              to answer some conjectures about  DNA.       The investigator develops accurate
              methods for  solving equations describing the evolution of an interface 
              between two different fluids.  This type of interface occurs, for  example, in
              secondary oil recovery where water is used to expel  remaining oil. The
              stability of the interface between the water  and oil is important for
              efficient recovery of the oil.  In  addition, some simplified models of fluid
              flow are developed and  solved to investigate some fundamental properties of
              turbulence.   The fluid could be air around an airplane wing.  This research 
              focuses on predicting coherent structures.  The investigator has  also recently
              developed a model of DNA which will be compared to  data from actual DNA in
              nature.  This model will be used to  address some conjectures about DNA which
              are of fundamental  importance.  ***
