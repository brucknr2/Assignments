Abstract    :
              This is SBIR Phase II research on designing a synapse for a neural  network
              (NN).  During Phase I the company devised a novel synapse  circuit, which is
              linear over a range that is 10 times that of  previous state-of-the-art
              circuits, and half the size of previous  circuits.  Also a NN for the chip was
              designed.  During Phase II,  the company is designing and testing the remaining
              network elements  and improving the synapse.  A full scale prototype chip that 
              implements on-chip learning, and contains up to 650,000 synapses is  being
              developed.  The chip design enables interconnection of  several chips in order
              to form a multi-layer network.  In addition  a prototype back propagation
              network which will integrate all  network elements on a single chip and allows
              interconnection of at  least two chips is being designed.
