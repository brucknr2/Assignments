Abstract    :
              9307840 Priestley This project carries out studies for the development of an
              innovative prestressed reinforced concrete system utilizing precast beams
              connected to columns by unbonded prestressing tendons continuous over the
              length of the multi bay frame.  The tendons provide continuity and moment
              resistance to the beams and the tendons remain elastic when flexural cracking
              develops during seismic response.  The major tasks are (l) testings of large
              scale assemblages, (2) modeling of hysterestic characteristics, (3) time
              history analyses of multistory frames, and (4) design details development. 
              Considerable advantages in terms of increased frame ductility, simplified joint
              design, etc. might be achieved through implementation of this innovative PRESSS
              system concept. ***
