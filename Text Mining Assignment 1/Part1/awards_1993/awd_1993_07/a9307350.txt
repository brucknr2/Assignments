Abstract    :
              9307350  Moses    The goal of this project is to use evanescent-wave
              ellipsometry to  measure the degree of order and thickness of the interfacial
              region  in liquid crystals as functions of temperature of both sides of the 
              isotropic-nematic transition.  The results will allow a critical  evaluation of
              current theories of liquid crystal surface phenomena  near the
              isotropic-nematic transition, as well as providing insight  into the
              microscopic mechanism of surface ordering in liquid  crystals.  Also,
              experiments will be undertaken to explore the  connection between the surface
              anchoring energy and the presence of  surface ordering or disordering.  The
              temperature dependence of the  anchoring energy will be measured in the
              vicinity of the isotropic-  nematic transition using a high-magnetic-field
              Freedericksz  transition technique in conjunction with a phase-sensitive
              optical  detection method.  Combining results from surface ordering 
              experiments and anchoring energy measurements should lead to a  better
              understanding of interfacial phenomena in liquid crystals.   The proposed
              investigation also will provide undergraduate students  an opportunity to
              become familiar with research on liquid crystals  and modern theories of phase
              transitions.  ***
