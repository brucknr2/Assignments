Abstract    :
              9307823  Kesseli       The long term objectives are to define the genetic
              changes  and evolutionary processes that lead to dioecy (separate male and 
              female individuals in a population) and to understand the common  factors that
              may be responsible for the repeated occurrence of  the dioecious reproductive
              strategy among living organisms.    %%%       Specifically the genetic bases
              for the evolution of dioecy  in the plant genus Silene is explored.  Four short
              term  objectives will be pursued.  The first is to develop genetic maps  for
              the sex chromosomes of the dioecious plant species Silene  latifolia and S.
              otitis.  The second is to evaluate gender  stability and potential shifts in
              breeding system in the genus.   The third is to characterize and define the
              organization of the  genus responsible for sex determination.  The fourth is to
               compare the architecture of these genes among related dioecious  species and
              hermaphroditic species which lack separate sexes and  sex chromosomes.
