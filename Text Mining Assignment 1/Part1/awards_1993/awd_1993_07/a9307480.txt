Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, Mr. Kim Seung-Og will              
              collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze an                 
              extensive data set collected over 5 seasons of excavation at the               
              site of Taegok-ri which is located in the Bosung river basin in                
              southwestern Korea. Situated on an alluvial plain the settlement               
              occupies an area of about 12,000 square meters. Excavation produced            
              approximately 150 houses and many functionally specific structures             
              including storage buildings and kilns. According to the preliminary            
              site reports its occupation extends from ca. 500 B.C. to 300 A.D.              
              About 108 well-preserved megalithic dolmens have also been found in            
              this region and appear associated with the site. Each contains up              
              to 20 human burials, many with associated artifacts. Mr. Seung-Og              
              will analyze both the burial and settlement remains. He will focus             
              on pottery which, in conjunction with absolute dating will provide             
              a sensitive chronological indicator. He will then study the                    
              organization of the settlement and the relationship between this,              
              the burial materials and the distribution of material remains. In              
              this way he will attempt to reconstruct the social and economic                
              organization of this community.                                                
                                                                                             
              Mr. Seung-Og shares with many archaeologists the goal of                       
              understanding how complex societies arise. The material with which             
              he will work documents an early stage in this process when social              
              stratification first becomes apparent and chiefdoms appear. The                
              combination of a large extensively excavated site, a wealth of                 
              material remains and an associated cemetery provides an excellent              
              data base with which to address this issue. It will provide                    
              information directly comparable with research done in other regions            
              of the world.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research is important for several reasons. It addresses an                
              important archaeological issue. It will make a rich and little                 
              known data base available to Western archaeologists and also                   
              strengthen scientific links between Korea and the United States.               
              Finally it will assist in the training of a promising young                    
              scientist.
