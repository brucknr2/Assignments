Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division 
              is supporting work by John W. Brady, Jr. at Cornell University on molecular 
              dynamics simulation of the conformations and dynamics of carbohydrates in 
              water solution. The work includes parameterization of a molecular dynamics 
              program especially designed to reproduce the factors controlling carbohydrate 
              conformational flexibility as affected by aqueous solvation.    Theoretical
              prediction of molecular structure by use of empirically derived  vibrational
              force and interaction constants has had much success both for  small molecules
              and in large DNA and protein studies.  Little effort has been  expended on the
              biologically significant family of carbohydrates, probably  because of the
              difficulties presented by their polyfunctional, highly  flexible structures. 
              Dr. Brady is attempting to extend the use of molecular  mechanics to these
              systems so that the technique can be used in studies of  cell binding,
              antigenicity, and viral attack.
