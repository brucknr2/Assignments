Abstract    :
                   This research will investigate a three trophic level                      
              interaction in a hybrid zone of cattails. The three levels of                  
              interactions include:  the cattails and the hybrid, herbivores that            
              eat the seeds of the cattails, and parasites that infect the                   
              seed-eating herbivores. To study how herbivory varies among the                
              three types of cattails, field experiments will examine the                    
              herbivore loads sustained by these cattails over a broad geographic            
              range. The role that hybridization and introgression play in                   
              influencing rates of herbivory and parasitoidism will be addressed             
              with a transplant study using potted plants of various crosses.                
              Herbivore exclusion and addition experiments will examine 1)                   
              whether the pattern of reduced herbivory on the hybrid cattails can            
              be attributed to plant properties or parasites, 2) the degree of               
              dependence that one species of seed eating herbivore has on                    
              the presence of another.                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              ALthough hybridization of plants has been responsible for 30-70% of            
              the genetic variation in and among plant species, little is known              
              about the three-way interactions that occur in zones of                        
              hybridization. By focussing on the patterns of herbivory and the               
              herbivore-natural enemy interactions, the dynamic nature of plant              
              hybrid zones will be elucidated. This research will make an                    
              important contribution to understanding the role of hybridization              
              and control of natural enemies in plant populations.
