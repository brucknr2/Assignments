Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry                   
              Division is supporting research by Professor Duncan on                         
              gas-phase complexes of metal ions with organic ligands using                   
              electronic spectroscopy and photochemistry in a molecular beam                 
              environment.  The experiments measure the geometry of the                      
              complex, its vibrational motions, and dissociation energies.                   
              Particular interest attaches to the first spectroscopic studies                
              of metal-ion pi complexes.

              In the gas phase, metal ions are capable of attaching to small                 
              organic molecules forming complexes with unusual bonding and                   
              energy characteristics.  These are being studied                               
              inspectroscopic and photochemical experiments with a view                      
              toward a better understanding of the nature of the forces                      
              holding the complexes together.
