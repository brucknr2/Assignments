Abstract    :
              9307547  Gould  The focus of this research is mechanistic and structural 
              studies on a recently recognized class of oxygenase enzymes,  hydroquinone
              epoxidases, that catalyze the four-electron  oxidation of a hydroquinone to an
              epoxyquinone. This novel  reaction-type is involved in the biosynthesis of
              numerous  bacterial and fungal metabolites, as well as in the action of 
              vitamin K. The specific aims propose: (1) to harvest larger  quantities of the
              proteins through a sequence involving  microsequencing, cloning, and
              overexpression; (2) to identify  the native metal(s); (3) to determine the
              location of exogenous  oxygen by the use of oxygen-18; (4) to probe the
              latitude of  the enzyme active sites in substance acceptance; and (5) to 
              examine the use of modified substrates with the capacity to  covalently modify
              the active sites.  %%%  With this award, the Synthtic Organic Program is
              supporting the  research of Dr. Steven J. Gould of the Department of Chemistry 
              at Oregon State University. Professor Gould will focus his work  on the study
              of a recently recognized class of enzymes,  hydroquinone epoxidases.The project
              uses a multi-faceted  approach that blends synthesis, biosynthesis, enzymology,
              and  molecular genetics in order to better understand which  reactions are
              available in Nature and how they are linked to  produce complex structures.
