Abstract    :
              9307067  Sponsel  The proposed research involves a new screening procedure for 
              mutagenised Arabidopsis thaliana seeds to select plant stature  mutants which
              differ in their ability synthesize or respond to  the bibberellin (GA) group of
              plant hormones.  Since GAs are  normally required to counteract abscisic acid
              (ABA)-induced seed  dormancy in Arabidopsis the original mutagenesis will be 
              conducted using seeds which are homozygous recessive at the AB13  locus.  The
              ab13 allele causes insensitivity to ABA and hence  prevents seed dormancy.  It
              is expected that mutations which  perturb the biosynthesis or response to GA,
              and which would  normally prevent seed germination, will not impair germination
              in  ab13 seeds.  Therefore this screening protocol should allow the  isolation
              of new GA mutants, especially new GA-response mutants.    During the twelve
              months of this award it is proposed to begin  the genetic analysis of these
              mutants in association with Dr. M.  Estelle.  The biochemical analysis will
              also be initiated.  It  will involved the identification and qualification of
              GAs in the  new mutants using combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  
              The characterization of new GA-insensitive mutants in which the  reception of
              the GA signal, or the tranduction of that signal  into a growth response is
              impaired will assist in the  identification of genes which are involved in
              these events.
