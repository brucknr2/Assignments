Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Vema fracture zone is the northernmost of the slow-                   
              spreading, long-offset transform faults along the Mid-Atlantic                 
              Ridge at the latitude of the bulge of Africa. The morphology of the            
              fracture zone is dominated by a flat-flooded, sediment-filled                  
              valley and a transform-parallel transverse ridge that towers 2 to              
              4 km above the valley floor. A recent series of divers by the                  
              French submersible Nautile has shown that the northern flank of the            
              transverse ridge exposes all of the principal units of the oceanic             
              crust. This project seeks to understand why the transverse ridge               
              has been uplifted above the adjoining seafloor, and to exploit the             
              existence of this uplift by examining a section through the oceanic            
              crust exposed on the northern flank of the transverse ridge. The               
              project will begin by mapping a 200 km long section of the                     
              transverse ridge with Hydrosweep and with LDGO's multispectral                 
              near-bottom-town side-looking sonar system. The objectives are: (1)            
              to map the network of faults along which vertical motion has                   
              occurred; (2) to determine whether Vema transverse ridge is                    
              symmetrical in composition and structure; (3) to map the geometry              
              and extent of the shallow water limestone cap on the transverse                
              ridge; (4) to along-strike variability in the thickness of crustal             
              units, and the crustal section as a whole; (5) to image the                    
              contacts between crust and upper mantle and among crustal units;               
              and (6) to map dip and strike of sheeted dikes outcropping in the              
              transverse ridge.
