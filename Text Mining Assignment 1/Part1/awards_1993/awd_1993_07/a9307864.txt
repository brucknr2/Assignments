Abstract    :
                   The Keck Consortium in Geology proposes to recruit ten                    
              minority students each year for inclusion in two of the                        
              Consortium's undergraduate field research projects during 1993-94              
              and 1994-95.  The students will have completed their sophomore                 
              college year and will be supported on their home campus by an on-              
              campus faculty sponsor.  The students will spend three to four                 
              weeks in the field and one to two weeks writing and illustrating               
              a final report covering their field research project.  The results             
              of their effort will be reported in poster session format at the               
              annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology and published in the                 
              Research Symposium Volume.  One research project for 1993-94 will              
              be located in Quetico Provincial Park, Ontario and will deal with              
              the Precambrian geology along a terrane boundary.  The second                  
              project will be in southern Vermont and covers the glacial and                 
              hydrologic aspects of the Vermont Valley.  The projects 1994-95                
              will be located in Quetico Provincial Park and in the region of                
              Clark Fork, Wyoming.
