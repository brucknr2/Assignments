Abstract    :
              9307836  Drueckhammer  The focus of this research is the development of
              preparative  electroenzymatic synthetic methodology.  The reactions of  flavin
              containing oxidases and dehydrogenases will be driven  electrochemically in the
              reverse direction for the asymmetric  synthesis of amino acids and hydroxy
              acids.  Diffusable  mediators (viologen derivatives) will be used to transfer 
              electrons from the cathode to the enzyme.  Medium to high  molecular weight
              electron transfer mediators will be prepared  for use in a size-exclusion
              membrane enclosed electroenzymatic  reactor.  Applications of the technique for
              the synthesis of  D-amino acids, L-alpha-hydroxy acids and D-aldose sugars will
               be probed.  %%%  With this award, the Chemistry Division and the Division of 
              Chemical and Thermal Systems are jointly supporting the work of  Dr. Dale G.
              Drueckhammer of the Department of Chemistry at  Stanford University.  The focus
              of the work, submitted under  the EPRI/NSF Initiative in Electrochemical
              Synthesis, is on  developing technology that combines the power of enzyme 
              catalysis with the utility of electrochemistry to achieve  preparative scale
              electroenzymatic synthesis.   The success of  the project could presage a new
              area of biocatalysis for use in  the enzymatic synthesis of organic and
              biological compounds.  ***
