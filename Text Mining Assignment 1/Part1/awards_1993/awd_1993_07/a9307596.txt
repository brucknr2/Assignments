Abstract    :
                   This work is concerned with the study of index reduction                  
              formulas for central simple algebras on passage to the function                
              field of a projective variety.  The type of variety under                      
              consideration is a twisted form of G/P where G is a split                      
              reductive algebraic group and P is a parabolic subgroup of G.                  
              The index reduction formula will follow from a knowledge of the                
              Grothendieck group of the variety of interest, which has been                  
              computed in general only when G is connected.  The principal                   
              investigator will investigate the Grothendieck group of the                    
              twisted forms of G/P when G is not connected, where it is clear                
              from examples that some new phenomena not seen in the connected                
              case will arise. The principal investigator will also study                    
              central simple algebras with involution, and the associated                    
              generalized even Clifford algebras.                                            
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring              
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                           
              multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                 
              satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                 
              not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                         
              multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                     
              matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                 
              has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing              
              significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.
