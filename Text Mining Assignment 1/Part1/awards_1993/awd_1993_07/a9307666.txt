Abstract    :
              9307666 Abrams The project will investigate the use of existing analytical
              models for determining nonlinear dynamic response of precast concrete frame
              systems with ductile connections.  Computational models developed previously
              within the PRESSS program will be verified by correlating computed response
              with measured response of three reduced scale structures.  Each of the reduced
              scale frame systems will be constructed using frame connection details derived
              from full scale PRESSS experiments.  Test structures will be subjected to an
              array of light, moderate and strong simulated earthquake motions using the
              Illinois shaking table.  Hysteresis relations for reduced scale frame
              connections will be characterized for input to computational models based on
              results of a supplemental series of proposed static tests.  In addition to
              verifying numerical models, dynamic response of the physical models will be
              used to suggest simplified analytical procedures for calculating dynamic
              response.  Results of these simplified procedures will then be correlated with
              response computed with more complex models for verification.  In addition,
              response computed using simplified models will be correlated with measured
              dynamic response of an actual precast frame building subjected to an
              earthquake.  Once developed, the simplified analytical methods will be used to
              examine system response for various frame systems in different U.S. seismic
              zones with different site characteristics.  This study will be           h)    
                   0*0*0*         done with the purpose of extrapolating large scale
              component test data to design of frame structural systems across the nation.
