Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The prehensile tail exists within 5 New World primate genera (it               
              also has evolved independently in two suborders of reptiles, an                
              order of amphibians, an six orders of mammals).  In the primates,              
              it clearly evolved twice.  Despite the importance of this                      
              structure, little is known regarding the function and pattern of               
              prehensile tail use in any primate genus.                                      
                                                                                             
              This study will contribute to an understanding of how and why the              
              prehensile tail is used by three primate genera - the howler                   
              (Alouatta), the spider monkey (Ateles), and the capuchin (Cebus).              
              Earlier suggestions that the prehensile tail was an effective                  
              adaptation allowing the suspension of large bodied animals in small            
              branch environments, where they could reach large fruits, for                  
              example, have become clearly insufficient. The feeding and                     
              positional behaviors of each of the three species will be compared             
              in two forests which differ in canopy structure and plant species              
              diversity.  This research will involve analysis of the resources               
              used by the primates and quantitative observation of their                     
              positional and feeding behavior.
