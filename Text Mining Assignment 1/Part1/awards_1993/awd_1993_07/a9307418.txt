Abstract    :
                9307418  Vitek    This U.S.- Czech research project is between Dr. Vaclav
              Vitek of   the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Vaclav Paidar of the Czech 
              Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics.  The researchers seek to   establish
              a link between the structure and properties of more general,  asymmetrical
              boundaries, and the relationships between structures of different   boundaries.
               Establishing a link between the structure and properties of rather  special,
              short period boundaries and boundaries of general nature is of   principal
              importance for extension of the present atomistic studies of   boundary
              properties.  The researchers will also study the nucleation  of new
              three-dimensional phases at grain boundaries and dynamic processes  taking
              place at grain boundaries.  In the process, they will assess the stability  of
              the corresponding structures using the concept of atomic level elastic  moduli,
              advanced earlier in Prof. Vitek's research supported by NSF.    Results are
              expected to contribute to our knowledge of non-symmetric grain  boundary
              structures, which can effect the structure and properties of metallic  and
              ceramic materials.  This project in materials research fulfills the program 
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the 
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool  
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
