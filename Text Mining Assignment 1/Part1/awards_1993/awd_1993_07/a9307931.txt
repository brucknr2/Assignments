Abstract    :
              Glycoconjugates are widely distributed in nature as glycoproteins,             
              glycolipids and proteoglycans.  The past decade has produced an                
              extraordinary burst of activity in this field.  Crucial roles for              
              glycoconjugates have been defined for hormone binding, growth                  
              factors and toxins.  Furthermore, roles have been defined in                   
              fertilization, differentiation, immune response and the social                 
              behavior of cells.  These phenomena have contributed to stimulating            
              investigators to clone the enzymes involved in glycoconjugates                 
              metabolism.  The growth of glycoconjugate research into Molecular              
              Biology is complemented by technical improvements to determine                 
              structure, such as NMR spectroscopy, X-ray  crystallography and                
              computer modelling.  The recent advances in this field will be                 
              presented at the XIIth International Symposium in Poland in August,            
              by the most active and well-known scientists in their respective               
              areas.

              Young scientists from the USA will be given the opportunity to                 
              attend the XIIth International Symposium on Glycoconjugates.  The              
              purpose of this meeting is to present and discuss the major                    
              advances in the structure and function of glycoproteins,                       
              glycolipids and proteoglycans.  Application of the recent findings             
              to biology, medicine, agriculture and biotechnology will represent             
              the major thrust of the meeting.  This symposium provides an                   
              important opportunity and forum for exchange of research                       
              information on an international level.
