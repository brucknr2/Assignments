Abstract    :
               Computational graph theory has emerged as a powerful medium  for the
              development of algorithmic techniques (e.g., for  dynamic algorithms, on-line
              algorithms, parallel algorithms,  approximation algorithms, data structure
              design, etc.).  Graph theory provides an excellent way to model problems 
              related to transportation, network design, optimization,  VLSI and many other
              fields.  This allows one to both develop  and illustrate the power of different
              algorithmic tools.  This project studies two aspects of efficient algorithm 
              design.  The first aspect is the study of intractable  problems (many
              optimization problems fall under this  category), and the design of efficient
              algorithms to obtain  approximate solutions. The second aspect is the study of 
              problems that are known to be solvable exactly in polynomial  time, but there
              is a wide gap between the known upper and  lower bounds.  The specific problems
              studied are problems   that are becoming important in the design of efficient
              and   reliable communication networks.  They address issues that are  relevant
              for higher reliability of communication at low  cost, and are of interest in
              network design and in the  implementation of broadcast protocols.  Some of the
              tools  and ideas that are used in the solutions for these problems  will have
              applications to solving other problems as well.
