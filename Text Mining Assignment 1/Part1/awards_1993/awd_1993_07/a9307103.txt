Abstract    :
              9307103  Basinska-Lewin      This is a proposal to study ionospheric signatures
              of the plasma sheet boundary layer  and reconnection processes in the distant
              magnetotail.  The main objective is to  advance the understanding of physical
              processes occurring in regions of the  magnetosphere that map near the poleward
              boundary of the evening aurora.  The  study will be accomplished through  a
              comparison of model predictions with  incoherent scatter radar data measured
              from the ground, in conjunction with field and  particle measurements from a
              low altitude satellite crossing the topside ionosphere  above the radar's field
              of view.  Results of this research will be used to specify  optimal
              instrumental modes for a future coordinated ground campaign.  ***
