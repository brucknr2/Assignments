Abstract    :
                   This project involves three senior researchers working in                 
              two areas of algebraic and geometric topology:  (1) Automorphism               
              groups of free groups, from the viewpoint of homological algebra               
              and geometric group theory.  Here the investigators have recently              
              begun the development of a new three-dimensional model for                     
              automorphisms of free groups, refining the standard model, which               
              is essentially one-dimensional.  (2) Controlled and equivariant                
              topology of manifolds and generalized manifolds, in particular,                
              the study of the properties of the new class of                                
              higher-dimensional generalized manifolds recently discovered by                
              Bryant, Ferry, Mio, and Weinberger.                                            
                   Group theory, the mathematical study of symmetries, is a                  
              pervasive thread in almost all the hard sciences, from quantum                 
              physics to data encryption.  Free groups are the least                         
              constrained types of groups, from which all other groups are                   
              obtained by adding special relations.  Hence the study of the                  
              symmetries, or automorphisms, of free groups has a particular                  
              significance for group theory.  Manifolds are the global                       
              mathematical models of the universe we live in.  Recent                        
              developments in theoretical physics, such as string theory, show               
              that one should not confine one's attention just to three                      
              dimensions or even the four dimensions of space-time; more                     
              dimensions often provide a more accurate model, even if we cannot              
              see them with our eyes.
