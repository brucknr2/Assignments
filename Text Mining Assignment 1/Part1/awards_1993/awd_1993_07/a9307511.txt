Abstract    :
              Experimental and theoretical studies of the radiative  properties of atoms that
              are in the presence of a phase-  conjugate mirror (PCM) are proposed.  The
              studies will  investigate the prediction from quantum theory that an atom  in
              its ground state is spontaneously excited when the atoms  is radiatively
              coupled to a PCM.  These results would  confirm that the description of this
              system using classical  field theory is inadequate to describe the effect of
              the PCM  on the atoms.  The PCM will be based on the nonlinear  optical process
              of four- wave mixing in a potassium vapor  cell.  The quantum-noise properties
              of the PCM will be  characterized as a precursor to the primary goal of the 
              proposed research.  Additional experimental and theoretical studies on the 
              radiative properties of atoms in the presence of a phase-  conjugate resonator
              will also be made.  These studies offer the possibility of studying the
              behavior  of a collection of atoms when a fraction of the field modes  to which
              the atoms are coupled are in a squeezed vacuum  state.
