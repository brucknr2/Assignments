Abstract    :
              Dr. Susan Tucker is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                  
              and Computational Chemistry Program to study supercritical                     
              fluid solvent effects on chemical reaction rates.  Molecular                   
              dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations will be used to                           
              characterize the pressure and temperature dependence of both                   
              the static and dynamic components of the solvation effects.                    
              For both of these components, critical tests of theoretical                    
              methods against the simulation results will be used to                         
              determine the importance of behaviors which are unique to SCF                  
              solvents, such as clustering, and to identify which of these                   
              must be incorporated into theoretical models designed                          
              specifically to treat supercritical solvent effects.

              Supercritical fluid solvents have proven to be an exciting                     
              medium for chemical reactions, both for the oxidative                          
              destruction of hazardous organics and for the selective                        
              synthesis of commodity chemicals.  The uniqueness of                           
              supercritical fluid solvents arises because their solvating                    
              properties may be changed dramatically with only modest changes                
              in pressure and temperature.  The proposed theoretical studies                 
              will provide a significant advance in our molecular level                      
              understanding of these technologically important solvents.
