Abstract    :
              9307501  Averill  Denitrification is a key process in the nitrogen cycle, which 
              controls the amount of nitrogen available for growth of plants,  including food
              crops.  Estimates suggest that up to 30% of  fertilizer nitrogen is lost via
              denitrification.  A linear pathway  for reduction of nitrite to N2 via NO2, NO
              and N2) seems to be the  predominant one, although evidence consistent with
              direct reduction  of NO2 to N20 exists for some organisms.  The objective of
              the  proposed research is to elucidate the pathway(s) by which N02 is  reduced
              to N20 in biology.  Specific goals include:  (1) the use of  isotope labelling,
              chemical trapping, and kinetics studies to  examine the mechanism of nitric
              oxide reductase; (2) the use of  genetic techniques to probe nitrite
              reductase/nitric oxide  reductase interactions in denitrifiers, to determine
              whether a  functional nitric oxide reductase is necessary for denitrification 
              by Achromobacter cycloclastes, and to clarify the roles of the  metal centers
              in the Cu- and heme cd1 -containing nitrite  reductases; (3) characterization
              of the mechanism of nitrite  reduction by a prototypical eukaryotic
              denitrifier, the mold  Fusarium, which appears to utilize a cytochrome P-450 as
              a nitrite  reductase.  %%%  The proposed research should result in a
              fundamental understanding  of how diverse organisms utilize nitrogen oxides as
              terminal  electron acceptors.  Since denitrifiers are attractive candidates 
              for a variety of biotechnological applications, including waste  water
              remediation, and in addition are important sources of the  greenhouse gas N20,
              these results are likely to have significant  practical implications as well.
