Abstract    :
              9307962  Golin       In yeast, mutations in about ten genes bring about either 
              hyper-resistance or hypersensitivity to a broad spectrum of drugs.   Previous
              genetic analysis has suggested that these phenotypes are  due to alterations in
              a putative trans-membrane protein pump and  the gene products that regulate it.
               The experiments in the present  project have several goals.  First,
              biochemical studies are being  carried out which should establish whether drug
              resistance in  mutants is indeed due to drug efflux.  Second, genetic studies
              are  being done which will clarify whether there is a second pumping  mechanism
              with different drug specificites as implied by previous  work.  Finally, simple
              experiments which might clarify whether  these trans-membrane pumps have other
              roles in the cell besides  drug export are being conducted.  %%%  The research
              has implications for clinical problems such as the  rise of
              multiply-drug-resistant yeast and tuberculosis infections.  ***
