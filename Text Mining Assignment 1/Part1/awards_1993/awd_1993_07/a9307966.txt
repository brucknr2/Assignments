Abstract    :
                   McCullough will work in the area of dilation theory, a well               
              established part of functional analysis which has made contact                 
              with other areas of mathematics such as differential equations                 
              and complex function theory.  Topics to be investigated include                
              interpolation problems of Caratheodory and Nevanlinna-Pick type,               
              interpolation and commutant lifting theory for general                         
              reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, operator and function theory                
              on multiply-connected domains, as well as the theory of theta                  
              functions.                                                                     
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
