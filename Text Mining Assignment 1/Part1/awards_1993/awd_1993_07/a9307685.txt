Abstract    :
              9307685  Gowda  An affine complementarity system is defined by a finite number
              of  linear equalities, linear inequalities, and complementarity  conditions. 
              This project will investigate the theory and  computation of affine
              complementarity systems based on their  equivalent formulation as a system of
              nonsmooth equations and on  degree theory.  On the theoretical side, the goal
              is to develop a  comprehensive theory covering uniqueness, existence, and 
              sensitivity/stability aspects of these systems.  The aim is to  present a
              unified theory for linear, mixed linear, vertical, and  horizontal
              complementarity problems, and affine variational  inequalities.  On the
              computational side, the goal is to discover  and analyze feasible/infeasible
              interior point algorithms for  solving affine complementarity systems.  The
              research will build  on work in recent years which has demonstrated the
              fruitfulness  of nonsmooth-equations and degree theory approach to variational 
              inequalities, complementarity problems, and nonlinear programs.  ***
