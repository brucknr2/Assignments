Abstract    :
              9307149  Liu  This research is in the application of the theory of foliations 
              to power systems.  More specifically the intent is to (1) Derive  a new theory
              which will integrate various dynamic mechanisms,  including those governing the
              frequency and voltage behaviors and  their interaction. (2) Apply the theory of
              foliations to develop  a new method for power system dynamic analysis which
              allows  interaction of various mechanisms but can also be decomposed to  direct
              the focus on a specific phenomenon.  (3) Develop  controllability criteria and
              control algorithms based on the  foliations derived from the power system
              model.  ***
