              This is an award to support international                                      
              travel of the Principal Investigator to an                                     
              international conference on carbon dioxide                                     
              management at which he has been invited to

              deep ocean placement of excess amounts of                                      
              this gas.  Other issues to be addressed at                                     
              this conference include dispersal modeling                                     
              and engineering design of systems to place                                     
              the carbon dioxide in deep ocean locations,                                    
              hydrate formation and biological effects of                                    
              this management practice.
