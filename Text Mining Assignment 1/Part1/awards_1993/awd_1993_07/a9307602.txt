Abstract    :
               This project investigates SINC methods for ODES.  The  following tasks are
              undertaken; (1) develop a SINC ODE-IVP   (sequential  and/or parallel) program
              package for solving ordinary   differential equation  initial value problems,
              (2) develop a (sequential and/or   parallel) program  package to evaluate
              multidimensional convolution integrals,   (3) write a  program package which
              uses the Maple program to reduce a   differential or integral equation to a
              system of algebraic   equations, based  on SINC derivative and/or SINC
              convolution collocation, (4)   write program  packages, based on SINC
              derivative and/or SINC convolution   collocation, to  solve problems which are
              important for ongoing research at  the University of Utah (the forward problem
              Maxwell   equations,  with variable permeability and permittivity, but with  
              conductivity; the solution, based on SINC convolution   collocation, of  the
              integral equation formulation of a scalar conservation   law problem  in two
              and three dimensions), and (5) comparison studies of   complexity and stability
              of SINC and classical methods,   especially in areas  in which one can expect
              SINC methods to have advantages over   methods, such as for problems with
              singularities, problems   over unbounded  regions, boundary layer problems,
              stiff problems, and   intensive problems such as the solution of the above
