Abstract    :
                 The research entails applying differential geometric                        
              techniques to the Feynman path integral approach to the modern                 
              quantum theory of gravity.  This also involves techniques from                 
              the topological theory of knots, in particular the recently                    
              developed concept of the Jones polynomial.  The scope of this                  
              research would provide a significant contribution to mathematical              
              physics.  Participation by undergraduates in the projects will be              
              encouraged.
