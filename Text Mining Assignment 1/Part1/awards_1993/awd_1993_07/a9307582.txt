Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research in three related areas will be pursued. In the first part,            
              heterotriangulenes will be used as building blocks for                         
              nanostructures. These molecules with molecular weights of over 1000            
              Daltons will be investigated with regard to inclusion compound                 
              formation, and polarizability and electron-transfer involving the              
              pi-aromatic systems. In the second part, topologically                         
              stereoisomeric entwined networks will be synthesized, whose                    
              structures are based on graph theory. In the third part, the                   
              synthesis of bowl-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons will                 
              accomplished. The dynamics of the bowl-to-bowl inversion will be               
              studied by dynamic NMR spectroscopy. Derivatives of these compounds            
              will be coupled to form macrocyclophanes related to fullerene                  
              fragments.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor Jay S. Siegel at the University of California, San Diego.            
              Large molecules will be synthesized which contain internal                     
              cavities. Inclusion of other molecules into these cavities will be             
              studied as well as the intramolecular interactions which will be               
              detected spectroscopically. Bowl-shaped large molecules will be                
              prepared and the bowl-to-bowl inversion barrier will be determined             
              by spectroscopic methods. These bowl-shaped molecules will also be             
              coupled to produce fragments related to fullerene, a recently                  
              discovered allotrope of carbon. Finally, molecules will be                     
              synthesized where chains of atoms become entwined. The particular              
              entwined pattern is based on graph theory, a mathematical                      
              discipline.
