Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on two topics: (1) the almost                    
              everywhere convergence of weighted averages, and (2) spectral                  
              type of rank one transformations.  The first problem operators on              
              probability spaces and the study of sequences of measures for                  
              which the corresponding operators fail to converge.  In the                    
              second study, rank one transformations has been a source of                    
              numerous and important examples in ergodic theory; however, their              
              spectral type has not been studied in depth.                                   
                   This research is in the general area of modern analysis                   
              where researchers examine the theory of operators and                          
              transformations on various spaces of finite and infinite                       
              dimension.
