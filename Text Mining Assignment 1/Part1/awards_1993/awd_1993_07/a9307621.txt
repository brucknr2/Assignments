Abstract    :
              9307621  Denell   Abstract  The powerful methodological approaches possible with
               Drosophila have shown that two clusters of homeotic genes (the ANT-  C and the
              BX-C) function to establish developmental fate.  Comparative studies indicate
              that the ANT-C and BX-C are derived  from a single ancestral cluster which
              arose very early in animal  evolution; descendants of this ancestral cluster
              can be recognized  in all higher animals which have been examined including
              mammals,  where the included genes also play roles of great developmental 
              significance. The focus of this project is a study of the evolution  of the
              regulative functions of these homeotic genes by comparing  Drosophila to
              Tribolium castaneum, the red flour beetle. Beetles  and flies diverged about
              300 million years ago and in many  morphological and developmental aspects
              beetles are relatively more  primitive. Most important is the fact that
              Tribolium can be used  for genetic analysis with resolution approaching that
              possible with  Drosophila. This project is directed toward that portion of the 
              Beetle ancestral cluster which resembles the ANT-C of Drosophila.  We will 1)
              define all necessary genetic functions in the ANT-C-like  region by saturation
              mutagenesis and describe the resulting  phenotypes 2) molecularly clone this
              region 3) determine the  temporal and spatial pattern of expression of these
              genes and 4)  elucidate the nature of the interactions of these genes with one 
              another and with upstream and downstream genes.  %%%  Studies of the genetic
              mechanisms controlling developmental  commitments during embryogenesis are
              among the most active and  significant in biological research. These studies
              should contribute  to insight into that process as well as to a better
              understanding  of the evolution of mechanisms controlling such regulatory 
              networks.  ***
