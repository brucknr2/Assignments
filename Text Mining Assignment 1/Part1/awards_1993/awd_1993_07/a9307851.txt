Abstract    :
              9307851  Zander  This is an award to support research on the  removal of natural
              organic matter from water  by use of synthetic membranes.  The  investigator
              plans on studying the physical  and chemical factors that affect removal of 
              natural organic matter from water and factors  that influence fouling of
              membranes used in  water treatment processes.  The research  involves
              determination of membrane electro-  osmotic flow characteristics, membrane 
              polymer hydrophobicity, membrane porosity and  pore size and the dependence of
              the  membrane's efficiency on characteristics of  the solution being passed
              through the  membrane including the potential for fouling.    Results of this
              research are expected to  improve our fundamental understanding of the  way in
              which membranes react to fluids being  processed.  This understanding is
              expected to  lead to more efficient engineering design of  membrane processes
              for removal of pollutants  from water.
