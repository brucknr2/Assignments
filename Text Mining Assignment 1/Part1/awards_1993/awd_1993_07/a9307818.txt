Abstract    :
              This award will partially fund the travel expenses for invited                 
              participants for a workshop on "Biotechnology Applications in                  
              Biomaterials".  The workshop will be held on April 28, 1993 in                 
              conjunction with the Society for Biomaterials 1993 Annual Meeting              
              in Birmingham, Alabama.  The workshop will have sessions on                    
              Biomolecular Materials, Self-Assembly Systems and Tissue                       
              Engineering.  This conference is important since it will cover                 
              topics related to two Federal Coordinating Committees on Science,              
              Engineering and Technology (FCCSET) initiatives.  Also, the                    
              workshop should define areas of research that will be needed to                
              advance the bioengineering field of biomaterials.
