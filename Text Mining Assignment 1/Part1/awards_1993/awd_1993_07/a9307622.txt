Abstract    :
              9307622  Jackson  The focus of this project is to develop a comprehensive 
              mentoring program for minority undergraduate students.  Each  student will
              participate in a faculty mentor's research group  during the full calendar
              year.  Student stipends, faculty  tutoring and an outreach component highlight
              this project in  which Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics will be stressed. 
              The  project will be coordinated into the activities of the  Alliances for
              Minority Participation (AMP) and the Research  Careers for Minority Scholars
              (RCMS) in the state of California.  %%%  With this award, the Directorate of
              Mathematics and Physical  Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human
              Resources  are co-supporting Dr. William M. Jackson of the Department of 
              Chemistry and Dr. Rodney W. Cole of the Department of Physics  at the
              University of California, Davis.  The focus of the  project is the development
              of a comprehensive mentoring program  for minority undergraduate students in
              science.  ***
