Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research on motives and motivic            
              cohomology.  The principal investigator will continue his research             
              in the various properties of his new definitions of motives and                
              notivic cohomology.  Given any quasiprojective scheme X over an                
              algebraically closed field k, the Suslin complex of X should give              
              the mixed motive of X as an object in the derived category of                  
              abelian groups.  The principal investigator has already shown that             
              this is a very natural definition for X an arbitrary curve over k,             
              and he will investigate the case of surfaces.  In addition, he will            
              investigate the extent to which his generalized definition of the              
              Suslin complex can be shown to satisfy the desired axioms.                     
                   This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory.  In a                 
              broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns th evolution of concepts               
              from linear algebra such as basis and vector space.  This work has             
              significant implications for number theory and algebraic geometry,             
              and promises to make exciting connections between a number of                  
              different areas in mathematics.
