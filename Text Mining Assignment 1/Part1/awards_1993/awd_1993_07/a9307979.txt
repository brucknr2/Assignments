Abstract    :
              9307979  Boston  This is a study of the maize ribosome inactivating protein
              (RIP).   RIPs catalytically inactivate ribosomes by removing adenine A4324 in 
              rRNA.  This leads to inhibition of translation.  Maize PRI is the  only known
              single chain RIP gene product that accumulates as an  inactive precursor.  The
              specific objectives are to determine the  protein domains required for proRIP
              processing and RIP activity,  and to separate the nucleic acid binding from the
              catalytic domain.  %%%  Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs), which occur in
              the seed,  root, leaf, or sap of a wide variety of plants including maize, 
              wheat, and barley are extremely cytotoxic, and may serve defensive  as well as
              food storage roles.  Understanding activation and the  physiological role of
              these proteins are important for development  of selective cell-killing agents,
              including insecticides and  fungicides.  ***
