Abstract    :
              9307735 Recent theory predicts that some forms of hereditary disease may
              accumulate in humans and other animals due to opposing selection in the two
              sexes.  Positions on chromosomes (the physical units of hereditary information)
              where such opposing selection occurs are called sexually antagonistic genes. 
              Males and females of the same species are superficially very similar, yet when
              examined more carefully they differ in many ways.  In a very broad sense, the
              sexes are designed by natural selection to do different things:  males to
              produce and disseminate microgametes (sperm) and females to produce
              macrogametes (eggs) and frequently nurture their offspring.  The optimal
              phenotype (i.e. the sum of all characteristics of an organism) for males and
              females frequently may differ between the sexes leading to adaptation in each
              sex being compromised via counter selection in the other sex.  Recent
              experiments in my laboratory indicate that sex specific selection leads to a
              major genetic "tug of war". between the sexes potentially resulting in the
              build upon of hereditary diseases that produce sex specific dysfunction.  %%% 
              The proposed experiments use a Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly) model
              system to confirm and extend these earlier findings.  Fruit flies are used
              because they are so well known genetically and for purely pragmatic reasons
              (inexpensive culturing, short generation time, etc.).  Entire haplotype (one
              half of the hereditary material carried by an individual) will be transmitted
              father to son for 50 generations.  This protocol eliminates female specific
              selection.  Periodically over the course of the experiment the haplotype will
              be place in both males and  females and each sex's life time fitness will be
              assayed.  If sex specific selection is a major contributor to hereditary
              disease then these haplotype will substantially increase the fitness in males
              while reducing the fitness of females.
