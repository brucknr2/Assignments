Abstract    :
              9307245 Strauss           Heterochrony, the alteration of timing within ontogeny
              (development) resulting in accelerated or retarded developmental rates of
              structures with respect to ancestral conditions, provides an important
              developmental mechanism for creating morphological diversity among species. 
              This research involves a detailed examination of patterns of morphological and
              developmental variability in several divergent lineages of poeciliid fishes, a
              group of livebearing freshwater fishes occurring throughout Middle America. 
              Various aspects of development will be examined including allometric growth
              gradients (size/shape relationships), absolute and relative growth rates under
              standardized conditions, and the relative timings of ossification and other
              discrete ontogenetic events.  The overall patterns seen for different species
              will be interpreted within a phylogenetic framework. %%% The significance of
              this research is that it will contribute to a more detailed knowledge of the
              development of poeciliid fishes, and these results can be related to other fish
              groups.  The research also provides valuable information on patterns of
              morphological change associated with the size and shape of characteristics as
              well as the timing of development.  Finally, this research will utilize this
              interesting group of fish to develop analytical procedures that can be used to
              examine growth and development in other organisms. ***
