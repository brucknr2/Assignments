Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with the study of the noncommutative              
              differential geometry of deformations of commutative rings.  The               
              principal investigator has proved the algebraic index theorem for              
              any deformation of the ring of functions on a symplectic                       
              manifold.  The main technical tool was the theory of operations                
              in cyclic homology.  He plans to develop this construction                     
              further, which would yield the algebraic index theorem for                     
              families and foliations, the algebraic analogue of the                         
              Connes-Moscovici index theorem for an equivariant quantization of              
              a ring of functions, and index and character formula                           
              representations of quantizations of commutative rings.  These                  
              methods are also expected to yield various generalizations of the              
              Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem.                                             
                   This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of              
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
