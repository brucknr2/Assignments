Abstract    :
              9307211 Stein and Conant    The tree ferns of the world, placed in the family
              Cyatheaceae, are a large group of ferns, ca. 500 species, with little variation
              in chromosome number.  In this they are unusual for ferns, where polyploidy
              (chromosome complement doubling) and dysploidy (increase or decrease of
              individual chromosome pairs) mark many lineages.  Possibly novel mechanisms of
              species divergence may operate in the tree ferns, such as diploid level
              speciation after hybridization.  To explore such mechanisms, however, a
              phylogenetic framework for the tree ferns is required, in order to rationalize
              the choice of target or representative species for analysis.  Drs. Stein and
              Conant are continuing their phylogenetic analyses of tree ferns, concentrating
              now on Old World species from the australasian regions.  They are analyzing DNA
              mutations in chloroplast and nuclear genes to acquire new molecular data for
              phylogenetic reconstruction and to integrate with traditional morphological
              characters from fern taxonomy. %%%          New molecular data from gene
              sequencing are revolutionizing our understanding of the evolutionary
              relationships of organisms.  Work on Old World tree ferns will add data from
              both chloroplast and nuclear genes to traditional morphological features, to
              augment work on New World tree ferns.  A robust phylogeny for this large group
              of plants will allow focused study on novel mechanisms of speciation and
              further analysis of t he direction of change in anatomical and ecological
              features of these ferns.
