Abstract    :
                   The research is to study the implementation of design                     
              methodologies used for an innovative material handling process to              
              be built by a forest products company.  It is an opportunity to                
              interact with an actual industrial design process as it occurs in              
              industry, and to document that process.  Design criteria include               
              quality, cost, and functional requirements.  New design tools are              
              being used in this process.  Tools used in the design process                  
              include, among others, a new approach under development by the                 
              principal investigator called "Design for Fragmented Groups."                  
                   Development of more accurate, tested quality and cost models,             
              especially at the preliminary or conceptual design stages, is                  
              essential to support effective concurrent design.
