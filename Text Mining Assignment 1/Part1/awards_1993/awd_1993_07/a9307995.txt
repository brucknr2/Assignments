Abstract    :
              9307995  Oriani    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Richard A. Oriani,
              Corrosion Research  Center, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, to pursue with
              Dr. Su-Il Pyun,  Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea
              Advanced Institute of  Science and Technology (KAIST), for 24 months, a program
              of cooperative  research on the properties and mechanism of formation of
              passivating oxidic  films on aluminum and on tungsten.  Two important
              measurements, namely, (1)  the kinetics of passivation and (2) the mechanical
              stress generated during  film formation will be made in various electrolyte
              compositions and with  various potential-time conditions.    Oxidic films
              produced upon metal surfaces during corrosion of metals strongly  reduce the
              rate of subsequent corrosion.  This corrosion resistance in the  case of
              aluminum and tungsten results from the formation of a thin passivating  oxidic
              film.  It is known that the formation kinetics and film characteristics  vary
              with the electrolyte solution chemistry and the electrical potential at  which
              the film is generated.  Results of this research may produce a better 
              understanding of corrosion and passivation processes that prevent further 
              corrosion.  The collaborators are highly respected researchers in the field of 
              the proposal.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea 
              Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation 
              between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of 
              scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through 
              collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the 
              project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  
              This project adds an international cooperative dimension to the PI's research 
              under NSF Grant No. DMR-9111673.  ***
