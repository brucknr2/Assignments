Abstract    :
              9307328  Ng  This project will investigate high-Tc materials using low 
              temperature scanning tunneling microscopy.  A ultra-high-vacuum  system has
              been built to allow a study of tunneling as a function  of angle with respect
              to the superconductor surface.  In this way  the anisotropy in the tunneling
              current will be sought.  This can  be related to anisotropy in the density of
              electronic states of the  high-Tc materials, and provides input to and tests of
              current  theories of high-Tc materials.  The measurements will determine how 
              the anisotropy is influenced by temperature variation, scattering  processes,
              and the coupling strength between CuO2 layers.  %%%  This project studies the
              arrangement of electrons in the high-Tc  superconducting materials.  The
              high-Tc materials are characterized  by planes composed of copper and oxygen
              atoms.  Within these CuO2  planes, the arrangement of electron charge is
              anisotropic, but  direct measurements to determine the anisotropy are very
              difficult.   This project will use tunneling microscopy to detect electrons 
              having the surface at various angles.  The resulting anisotropy  will be used
              to test current theories and will provide important  fundamental information
              about the high-Tc materials.  The  information is also relevant to potential
              technology in that  superconducting devices may depend on the anisotropic
              properties of  the high-Tc materials.  ***
