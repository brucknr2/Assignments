Abstract    :
                   The proposed research entails a study of manifolds with                   
              affine connections of restricted holonomy and the geometry of                  
              submanifolds of certain classes of Riemanian symmetric spaces.                 
              Particular attention in the latter case will be paid to surfaces               
              in quaternionic-Kaehler manifolds where such surfaces can be                   
              studied by complex-analytic means relative to an associated                    
              complex manifold.  This research also entails a study of                       
              deformations of Einstein metrics on 4-manifolds.
