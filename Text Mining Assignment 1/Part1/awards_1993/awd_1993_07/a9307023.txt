Abstract    :
                   The problems that are to be addressed in this project lie in              
              the general area of spectral theory and number theory, with                    
              particular interest in trace formulae, explicit formulae and                   
              prime number theorems, and various analytic and arithmetic                     
              aspects of Arakelov theory.  The proposed research is very broad,              
              involving analysis, number theory, and algebraic geometry.                     
                   This research uses the techniques of algebraic geometry, one              
              of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had               
              a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                  
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                 
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                       
              robotics.
