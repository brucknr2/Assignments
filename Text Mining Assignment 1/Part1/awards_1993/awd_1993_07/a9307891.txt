Abstract    :
                   The workshop is intended to establish the goals and scope of              
              the new National Science Foundation-Division of Design and                     
              Manufacturing (DDM) initiative in Integration Engineering.  The                
              broad agenda is aimed at supporting the DDM community in new ways              
              that respond to the new mood in the country.  As an extension of               
              the DDM Advisory Committee work of April 1992, Integration                     
              Engineering will be the vehicle for projects that not only address             
              basic engineering-science, but also address issues such as:                    
              time-to-market, networked manufacturing, TQM, conservation, socio-             
              technical needs and human resource development.  Participants                  
              representing leaders from the engineering and business fields in               
              academia, industry and government will be invited.                             
                   The following highlights will be covered:  (1)  four keynote              
              papers on the needs for an expanded DDM program in Integration                 
              Engineering that can address major contributions to national                   
              competitiveness; (2) discussion groups on selected topics such as              
              Design, Planning, and Sensor-Based Manufacturing; (3) group reports            
              on the scope of new programs in Integration Engineering, with                  
              recommendations on the kinds of projects and initiatives that will             
              make major differences; and (4) a summary volume, prepared                     
              subsequent to the meeting on the way in which existing DDM projects            
              can be dove-tailed into the new initiative and how DDM can be                  
              responsive to the need for establishing projects that are both                 
              scientifically based and yet have impact on national                           
              competitiveness.
