Abstract    :
              9307024  Beuchat    Hummingbirds subsist almost entirely on a liquid diet
              composed of  floral nectar, and when energy demands are high they can consume 
              more than three times their own body mass in fluid per day.  At  the same time,
              however, the hummingbird's high metabolism  requires efficient extraction of
              nutrients and electrolytes from  a dilute food source that is passing rapidly
              through the  gastrointestinal tract for efficient nutrient extraction, 
              electrolyte conservation, and rapid elimination of water.    For a hummingbird
              to simultaneously balance energy, water, and  ion fluxes is a major challenge
              that raises fundamental questions  about hummingbird morphology and physiology.
               This study proposes  to address a central problem:       In what ways and by
              what mechanisms do the kidney and  gastrointestinal tract of hummingbird
              contribute to water   and  ion homeostasis while at the same time allowing
              maximum  efficiency of energy acquisition?    Using isotopically-labeled
              markers in artificial nectar, I can  determine the fraction of ingested fluid
              that is absorbed by the  intestine and the capacity of the kidney to eliminate
              excess  water without depleting the body of electrolytes.  The efficiency  of
              energy and nutrient extraction are determined under conditions  that influence
              the hummingbird's energy requirements, its  electrolyte balance, and the
              quality of its diet.  Together,  these studies will provide information about
              the unique  adaptations that allow hummingbirds to specialize on a liquid 
              diet.  ***
