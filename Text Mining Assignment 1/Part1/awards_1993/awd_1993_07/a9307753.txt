Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS 9307753  Phelan    The thermal boundary resistance (Rbd)
              occurring at the interface between high-critical-temperature (high-Tc)
              superconducting thin films and their substrates plays a major role in
              determining the operating temperature, and hence the feasibility, of high-Tc
              superconducting devices.  The research objectives are to develop a fundamental
              understanding of the relationship between the film/substrate interface
              microstructure and Rbd, and to formulate a model relating Rbd to easily
              measurable properties like Tc, critical current, and normal-state resistivity. 
              Experiments are performed, using a closed-cycle cryogenic apparatus, on films
              etched in a novel two-strip meander pattern that enables both normal and
              superconducting-state measurements to be conducted.  Two experimental
              procedures are proposed.  In one, a continuous-wave, visible laser beam serves
              as a heat source, thus allowing for superconducting-state measurements.  In the
              other, the oxygen content of the high-Tc film is varied so that the film Tc can
              be controlled, resulting in a normal-state film at temperatures much lower than
              usual.  This allows the two strips to serve as heaters and/or thermometers
              after a calibration of their electrical resistances versus temperature.  The
              experimental results permit a comparison between Rbd for superconducting-state
              and normal-state films, and provide valuable information for the thermal design
              of high-Tc thin-film devices.
