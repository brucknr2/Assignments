Abstract    :
              9305582  Tomsovic   Recent elegant experiments in mesoscopic, atomic and other
              systems are probing the deep connections between the quantum mechanical and
              classical mechanical worlds.  The theory bridging the two worlds is the realm
              of semiclassical approximations for which many long-standing, fundamental
              problems remain unresolved.  Although the bulk of the work on semiclassical
              mechanics has been concentrated in the energy domain, often the direct interest
              is in the time evolution of a system.  Until very recently only very
              rudimentary time dependent semiclassical techniques existed.  This work will
              focus on extending new, more powerful semiclassical propagation methods (which
              we developed) to apply to higher dimensions (which is important for physical
              applications), simplifying the problems arising from chaotic motion,
              investigating the leading corrections, and adapting the method to apply to
              stationary quantum mechanical problems.           ! G 2             U      F
