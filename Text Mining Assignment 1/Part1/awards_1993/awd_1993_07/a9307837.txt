Abstract    :
              9307837  Mann  This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and 
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, is concerned with the  synthesis, chemical
              reactivity, and photochemical and  photophysical behavior of
              cyclopentadienyl-arene ruthenium and  osmium complexes.  The primary objective
              of these studies is to  understand and control the partitioning of reactivity
              between  the metal and the arene ligand in the photochemically excited  state. 
              Syntheses of the previously unknown osmium complexes  will be done using newly
              developed electron transfer catalyzed  methods.  The arenes to be utilized will
              include a variety of  laser dye molecules as well as oligothiophenes. 
              Characterization methods will include infrared and optical  spectroscopies,
              quantum yields, variable temperature  luminescence lifetimes, and laser-flash
              photolysis studies of  electron transfer reactions.  These studies may lead to 
              improved optical and conductive devices.  %%%  New transition metal molecules
              will be prepared and  characterized for their chemical and photochemical
              reactivity.  Knowledge gained in these studies is expected to have 
              technological importance for new optical and electrically  conductive devices.
