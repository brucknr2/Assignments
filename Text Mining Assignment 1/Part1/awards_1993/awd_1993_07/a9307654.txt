Abstract    :
              The goal of the research is to obtain MR images in evolving                    
              physiological states, using the properties of hyperpolarized 129Xe             
              in (a) cell and tissue compartmentalization, (b) dramatically                  
              time-dependent distribution, and (c) response of NMR chemical                  
              shift, T1, and T2 to environment, O2, and exchange kinetics, to                
              obtain detailed anatomical images mapped with functional                       
              information.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Magnetic resonance imaging is important to basic as well as                    
              applied research in the biological sciences.  Current imaging                  
              methods depend on subtle differences in the magnetic properties                
              of water molecules in biological materials.  The available                     
              contrast is quite low and the ubiquitous presence of water                     
              prohibits its use, except in some flowing systems, to measure                  
              diffusion and compartmentalization.  The proposed research makes               
              use of the extreme ease of magnetic resonance detection of                     
              hyperpolarized Xe atoms and the fact that Xe distributes rapidly               
              in biological systems and similarly washes out rapidly.  If                    
              successful, these studies could lead to substantial changes in                 
              how magnetic resonance imaging experiments are organized and add               
              considerably to the method's informational content.
