Abstract    :
                   Advanced materials, such as ceramics and composites, are being            
              increasingly used in various applications.  The high cost                      
              associated with machining and damage generated during machining are            
              major detriments for implementation of these materials.  In some               
              cases, current machining methods cannot be used and innovative                 
              techniques or modifications of existing methods are needed.  These             
              problems are being addressed by researchers in many institutions               
              around the world; and the results are being communicated in various            
              technical conferences and published in journals.  However, these               
              conferences and journals have a limited scope, and do not cover the            
              broad spectrum of the problems.  For example, machining of polymer             
              composites, metal matrix composites, and ceramics are covered in               
              different conferences; and precision machining of optical                      
              materials are covered in others.  Nevertheless, the main issues of             
              cost and reliability are the same for all advanced materials.  The             
              goal of this conference is to strengthen communication and                     
              technology transfer among researchers and engineers involved in                
              various aspects of machining of advanced materials.
