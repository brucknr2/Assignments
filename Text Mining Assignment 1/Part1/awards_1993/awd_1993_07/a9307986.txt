Abstract    :
              9307986  Yu  Characterization of semiconductor structures with extremely high
              spatial resolution will be crucial for continued reductions in device size and
              for the development of advanced heterostructure devices.    The development of
              scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and related techniques has dramatically
              enhanced our ability to study properties of materials with atomic or
              near-atomic resolution.    STM offers several advantages over other techniques,
              such as x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
              photoluminescence, that have been used to probe atomic- and near-atomic-scale
              properties of semiconductors.    We propose to use cross-sectional STM to
              investigate the electronic and structural properties of novel semiconductor
              structures.  STM and related techniques offer both very high spatial resolution
              and sensitivity to electronic structure, allowing us to explore, with nanometer
              resolution, characteristics such as band-edge energy and carrier concentration
              profiles, structure of epitaxially grown interfaces, alloy composition and
              structural order, and perhaps heterojunction band-edge discontinuities.  Of
              considerable interest to us will be the investigation of relationships between
              structure and local electronic properties in alloys and at heterojunction
              interfaces.  ***
