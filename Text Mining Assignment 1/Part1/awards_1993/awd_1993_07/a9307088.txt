              proposal is being funded in parallel with a substantially identical one by
              Professor Axel Scherer of California Institute of Technology.  In a collabo
              rative UCLA/Caltech effort the PI proposes an experimental program to develop
              and test the technology for making 3 dimensional dielectric/metallic photonic
              crystal structures on the scale of optical wavelengths.  These should lend
              themselves to practical implementation in opto electronic technology and might
              be generically useful in optical science. ********
