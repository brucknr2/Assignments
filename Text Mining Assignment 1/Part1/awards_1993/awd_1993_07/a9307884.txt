Abstract    :
              Professor Thirumalai is supported by a grant from the                          
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop                     
              general theoretical methods for studying glassy states of                      
              chemical systems.  The two major aims of the research are to :                 
              1) investigate the efficacy of density functional theory (DFT)                 
              in describing the nature of glassy states; and 2) to develop                   
              generalized ergodic measures to ascertain the onset of                         
              activated transitions and to estimate the average free energy                  
              of activation separating various glassy minima.  Thirumalai                    
              will develop methodologies based on the properties of                          
              eigenvectors of the instantaneous dynamical matrix to describe                 
              the optimal reaction pathway for structural relaxation.  These                 
              methodologies will be applied to "soft" colloidal glasses such                 
              as O-terphenyl and glycerol as test cases.

              Glasses are non-crystalline states of matter which have unique                 
              materials properties of significant commercial importance.                     
              Glassy states exist in many chemical systems including                         
              polymeric materials and biological systems such as  DNA and                    
              RNA.  Thirumalai's research employs statistical mechanical                     
              methods to the study of glassy materials in an attempt to                      
              obtain a molecular level understanding of the physical                         
              properties which are unique to this class of materials.
