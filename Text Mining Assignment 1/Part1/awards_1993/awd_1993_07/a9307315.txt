Abstract    :
              9307315  Schnabel  This project is concerned with making massively parallel MIMD
               computers more usable and used by application scientists and  engineers.  It
              now seems clear that massively parallel, distributed  memory MIMD machines
              either are or soon will be the most powerful  supercomputers available, in
              terms of memory and speed.  So far,  however, their use by applications
              scientists has been seriously  hampered by the lack of easy-to-use, efficient,
              and portable  programming support.  It has also been hampered by the natural 
              reluctance of scientists and engineers to move their applications  to a new
              computing environment.  This proposal addressed both of  these problems,
              through the symbiotic development of language,  compiler, and run-time support
              for parallel scientific programming,  along with the development of substantial
              parallel scientific  applications in computational fluid dynamics and
              optimization.
