Abstract    :
              This investigation in the Theoretical and Computational                        
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division involves the                       
              continued development of the correlated effective valence shell                
              Hamiltonian method for describing the electronic structures of                 
              both small and large molecules.  Adaptations are being made to                 
              massively parallel computer systems, while applications include                
              photochemical reactions, nonadiabatic couplings in                             
              photo-dissociations, and the electronic spectra of conjugated                  
              pi-electron systems and transition-metal diatomics.

              The continued development of theoretical methods for describing                
              how the electrons in atoms and molecules interact with                         
              radiation and how this interaction affects the chemical                        
              reactivity of the atoms and molecules is a key thrust of this                  
              investigation in theoretical and computational chemistry.
