Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative project between Cornell and Brown                      
              Universities.  We propose to study magma genesis and                           
              evolution in St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Grenada through a                     
              multi-disciplinary approach that will include field work,                      
              petrographic study, major element, trace element, Sr, Nd, Pb                   
              and O isotope determination, and K-Ar dating.  Petrographic                    
              study will include both micro probe and laser-ablation-                        
              inductively-coupled-plasma-mass-spectrometry studies.  The                     
              immediate objectives of this study are to:  (1) determine                      
              the contribution of arc crust to the evolution of mantle-                      
              derived magmas in Grenada and St. Lucia, (2) use the most                      
              magnesian of these magmas, some of which are only slightly                     
              evolved since production in the mantle wedge, to investigate                   
              degree of melting and source enrichment, and (3) determine                     
              how magma composition has changed through time on these                        
              islands.  Achieving these objectives allows us to address                      
              several broader objectives.  These are:  enhanced                              
              understanding of (1) magma generation and evolution                            
              processes in island arcs, (2) tectonic evolution of the                        
              Caribbean region, (3) the conditions necessary for crustal                     
              assimilation to occur or not to occur, (4) mass transport                      
              from the subducting slab to island arc magmas, and (5) mass                    
              fluxes of incompatible elements to the deep mantle from                        
              subduction zones.  By focusing on a few localities with an                     
              improved experimental knowledge base, and having a wide                        
              range of data, we believe we can substantially improve                         
              earlier models.
