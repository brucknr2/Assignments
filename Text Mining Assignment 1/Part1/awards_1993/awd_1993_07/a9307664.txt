Abstract    :
              Lin         This project is investigating a novel parallel processing 
              technique, shift switching, in reconfigurable bus systems.  The  research has
              four parts.  The first part classifies and evaluates  shift switches and their
              inclusion in efficient VLSI  architectures.  The second part develops and
              analyzes some  efficient reconfigurable bus architectures with shift switches 
              for such parallel computations as prefix operations, sorting,  list ranking,
              tree search, and transitive closure.  The third  part investigates
              application-specific architectures using shift  switches for computer
              arithmetic, image processing, and computer  vision.  The fourth part
              investigates the relation between PRAM  models and reconfigurable busses with
              shift switching.
