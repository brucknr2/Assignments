Abstract    :
              The first three-dimensional, multimoment, mulifluid model will be              
              developed to study plasma transport phenomena in the auroral                   
              ionosphere and their relation to global plasma dynamics.  The                  
              formation of potential structures in the auroral ionosphere, their             
              connection to low-frequency waves and their association with plasma            
              heating and acceleration are important and outstanding issues                  
              concerning Ionosphere-Magnetosphere coupling.  To investigate these            
              processes we will generalize our existing one-dimensional (1D)                 
              multimoment, multifluid transport model ?Granguli et al., 1988! to             
              three-dimensions by adapting an existing 3D transport code ?Guzdar             
              et al., 1992!.  The proposed 3D code will preserve the extensive               
              magnetic field-aligned dynamics of our 1D model.  The 3D fluid                 
              equations permit a class of low-frequency fluid instabilities and              
              the associated cross-field transport to be treated simultaneously.             
              The consequences of these low-frequency instabilities on auroral               
              processes, such as the formation of potential structures, could be             
              significant but remain unexplored as yet.  The cross-field                     
              transport can substantially moderate the conclusions of 1D or 2D               
              models.  Since the transport is self-consistently generated by                 
              plasma fluid instabilities, a unified picture that incorporates                
              both the instability and transport processes requires a 3D                     
              formulation.  We will use the 3D model to investigate (1) self-                
              consistent generation of auroral potential structures and (2) the              
              associated auroral acceleration processes including plasma heating             
              due to kinetic instabilities.  The macroscopic effects of relevant             
              kinetic instabilities (such as the electrostatic ion cyclotron                 
              instability) will be incorporated into our 3D model via anomalous              
              collision terms, as was done in our 1D model.  The theoretical                 
              modeling effort will proceed in tandem with the experimental                   
              programs of Dr. J.L. Burch, Southwest Research Institute and Dr.
