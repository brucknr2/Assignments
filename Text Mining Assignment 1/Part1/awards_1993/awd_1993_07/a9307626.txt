Abstract    :
              Wulf         This project is building and measuring experimental memory  systems
              that match the high data rates of processors with the low  random access data
              rates of memory parts.  The goal is to detect  streams of memory references at
              compile time and use a smart  memory controller to prefetch the streams at run
              time.  The  memory controller can use features of the memory system such as 
              page mode, nibble mode, or Rambus to maximize the data rates of  the memory
              parts.  It then buffers the streams until the  processor asks for the data. 
              The project includes compiler  research as well as research into the
              architecture of the memory  controllers.  This is similar to the vectorization
              efforts on  such machines as the Cray supercomputers, but more general since  a
              smart memory controller can be designed for any combination of  processor
              speeds, memory features, and program characteristics.
