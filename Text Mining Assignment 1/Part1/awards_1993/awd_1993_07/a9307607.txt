Abstract    :
                   Local patterns of community changes are often embedded within             
              larger regional scale processes. Interpretation of changes at the              
              local scale are thus a function of regional level changes. Climatic            
              fluctuation and land use practices                                             
              are two regional level processes that affect local dynamics of                 
              forest community structure and biodiversity. This project will use             
              dendro-ecological methods to reconstruct a multi-century, regional             
              scale forest fire and climate history of southern taiga forests on             
              the central Siberian Plateau. Fire scar and ring-width chronologies            
              will be developed from a network of sites. The reconstructed fire              
              and climate records will be used to assess temporal and spatial                
              changes and trends in fire activity in association with centuries              
              long fluctuations in climate and land use practices. Parallel                  
              studies of paleofire and climate histories in similar forests in               
              the southwestern US and Sierra Nevada of California will provide               
              comparative data for assessing differences and similarities of                 
              regional scale fire climatologies of semi-arid regions in North                
              America and Siberia.

              This long-term historical perspective will provide baseline data               
              for models of future changes in forest communities driven by global            
              change and human land-use practices. In addition, reconstruction of            
              fire occurrence will be useful for assessing the importance of                 
              conifer forests as a source of atmospheric trace gases and                     
              particulates. Finally, the proposed research will strengthen                   
              collaborative scientiific relationships between US and Russian                 
              scientists.
