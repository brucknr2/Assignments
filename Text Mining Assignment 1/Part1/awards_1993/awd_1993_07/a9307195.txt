Abstract    :
              9307195  Coleman       Professor Coleman will continue his work on rigid
              analysis  in particular to applying these techniques to modular curves. He 
              hopes to obtain information about he local behavior at a prime p  of the
              representations attached to a modular form.       This project falls into the
              general area of arithmetic  geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest
              areas of  mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems  that
              withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new  error correcting
              codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern  computers (hard disks) and
              compact disks.  ***
