Abstract    :
              This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                    
              Program in the Chemistry Division involves the development of                  
              both new and improved mathematical and computational methods                   
              for calculating and predicting quantum dynamical processes of                  
              importance such as gas phase chemical reactions, intermolecular                
              energy transfer, photodissociation, and surface processes                      
              including adsorption and diffusion.  Specific theoretical tools                
              being developed include extensions of the discrete variable                    
              representation and quantum generalized Langevin equation                       
              approaches.

              Chemical reactions both in the gas phase and on surfaces are                   
              being successfully described by the use of increasingly                        
              sophisticated mathematical models.  Several such models are                    
              being developed in this theoretical study, thus aiding our                     
              understanding and control of a number of processes such as                     
              combustion, catalysis, and the formation of molecules and                      
              materials.
