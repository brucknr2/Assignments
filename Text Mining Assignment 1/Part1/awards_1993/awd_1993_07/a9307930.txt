Abstract    :
              9307930  Britt   While much is known about the mechanisms of DNA repair in
              bacterial  and mammalian systems, very little is understood about the 
              molecular mechanisms of DNA repair in plants. This proposal focuses  on the
              biochemical and molecular description of a protein involved  in the repair of
              methylated bases in the model higher plant  Arabidopsis thaliana. A cDNA clone
              involved in the repair of  methylated bases in the plant has been inserted into
              a strain of E.  coli defective in the repair of 3-methyladenine whereupon the 
              bacterium becomes more resistant to the lethal effects of the  alkylating agent
              methylmethane sulfonate suggesting that the cDNA  encodes a 3-methyladenine
              glycosylase. The objectives of this  proposal are to conclusively determine the
              nature of the repair  activity and to determine the role of this gene in
              resistance to  methylating agents in vivo and to study the regulation of the
              gene.  %%%  Genetic mutation is the source of diversity upon which selection 
              acts. Many mutations, including many naturally occurring mutations,  are
              produced as an indirect result of DNA damage. The spectrum of  such mutations
              is determined by the interaction of a variety of  repair mechanisms and the
              results of this study will give insight  into one such mechanism in plants.
