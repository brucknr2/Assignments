Abstract    :
              9307689  Crawford  The involvement of peroxidases in  lignin depolymerization
              and  cellulose delignification, and their  relationship to the activities of 
              cellulases, hemicellulases, and  esterases during lignocellulose  degradation,
              is to be examined.  Two  hypotheses are to be tested: (1)  peroxidases are
              essential for  actinomycete-mediated lignin  depolymerization; and (2)
              peroxidase  activity is the rate-limiting step  in lignin solubilization.  If
              both  these hypotheses are true, then  overexpressing peroxidases should 
              enhance the lignin solubilizing  activity of the Streptomyces strains  being
              investigated.  ***
