Abstract    :
              9307063  Goldblatt   The Index of Plant Chromosome Numbers is a compilation of
              original chromosome counts for plants published in scientific literature
              throughout the world.  The only index of this type, it is a major abstracting
              service to the botanical community as a primary source of chromosome
              information, a subject of unique importance in botany.  It also functions as a
              serviceable, general reference work, though by its nature incomplete, for
              current plant systematic research.  The botanical literature is reviewed by the
              approximately 25 worldwide contributing members of the project.  Data are
              forwarded to the editor, Peter Goldblatt, who coordinates the reviewing
              activities of the contributors and is responsible for compilation of published
              annual or multi-year indexes prepared from computer tape by a commercial
              printer.  Data are sorted by computer using programs developed specifically for
              the project at the Missouri Botanical Garden.  Data from published chromosome
              indexes are placed on-line immediately after publication and are available free
              of charge through the Missouri Botanical Garden's TROPICOS data base system and
              through internet.   This award provides funds for the continuation of this
              important bibliographic resource project in botany for another 5-year period. 
              %%%   Approximately 25 botanists review the world-wide published literature and
              forward any new information on plant chromosome numbers to Dr. Peter Goldblatt
              at the Missouri Botanical Garden.  There the information is added to a computer
              data base from which regular annual or multi-year volumes known as the Index to
              Plant Chromosome Numbers  are published.  This index is an important resource
              or research tool for plant systematists and other botanists, agronomists,
              horticulturists, etc. throughout the world.  Thus, this ongoing project
              provides a unique and valuable service to the scientific community.  ***
