Abstract    :
              9307794  Nayfeh    Technical Narrative:    This project represents a
              collaborative research  effort between the University of Illinois at 
              Urbana-Champaign and the University of Jordan in  Amman, Jordan.  The project
              will focus on the  preparation and characterization of the newly  discovered
              but not yet understood optical  activity of porous silicon using optical
              methods  and scanning tunneling microscopy.  Apart from  the scientific
              interest in the mechanism behind  its operation, there is interest in its
              potential  applications in electronic devices.  Thus this  newly discovered
              property of silicon, a cheap  semiconductor, may lead to the marriage of 
              optical and electronic circuits.  Project funding  will enable the research
              teams from both  universities to visit one another over the course  of this
              three-year study.    This project in materials research fulfills the  program
              objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
               United States and Jordan to combine complementary  talents and conduct
              research in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence.  ***
