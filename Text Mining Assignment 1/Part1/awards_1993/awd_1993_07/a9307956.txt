Abstract    :
              9307956  Maslak  A study of mesolysis will be undertaken, which is the  
              cleavage of radical ions to radicals and ions. The   relationship between
              activation energy for mesolytic   reactions and the free energy change for
              different modes of   bond rupture and electron apportionment to products will
              be   explored. The project will include probing solvent effects   and ion
              pairing as well as a search for a Marcus-type   inverted region for highly
              exergonic reactions. Redox   potentials of radicals, ions, and radical ions
              will be   measured by several methods and used to develop an empirical  
              relation to evaluate redox potentials that are necessary to   calculate
              thermodynamic quantities of mesolytic reactions. A   unifying theoretical
              treatment of unimolecular dissociation   reactions in solution will be
              developed from these results,   where the goal is a master equation that
              governs these   reactions. Mesolysis will also be studied by semiempirical  
              and ab initio molecular calculations in order to evaluate   pertinent
              stereoelectronic and charge delocalization   aspects.   %%%  This grant from
              the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor
              Przemyslaw B. Maslak at   Pennsylvania State University. Bond breaking in
              molecules   that contain either a positive or negative charge and a   radical
              center (an unpaired electron on an atom) will be   studied. The effect of
              solvent and pairing of these radical   ions will be considered in this study as
              well as special   effects when the reaction is highly favored. The energetics  
              of transferring an electron to or from radical ions,   radicals, and ions will
              be determined and these data will be   correlated with the rate of bond
              breaking of the radical   ions to give a master equation that governs these
              reactions.  ***
