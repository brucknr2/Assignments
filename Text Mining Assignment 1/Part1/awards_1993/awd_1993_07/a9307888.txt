Abstract    :
                   This research will combine an ecosystem process model (GEM)               
              and ecosystem data sets from a variety of ecosystem types world-               
              wide to address effects of carbon/nutrient interactions on                     
              ecosystem recovery from major disturbances.  Objectives are 1) to              
              identify characteristics of element cycles that affect ecosystem               
              respond to and recovery from disturbances, 2) synthesis of                     
              disturbance and recovery data, 3) analysis of changes in carbon                
              storage, nutrient cycling, water balance and other ecosystem                   
              processes during recovery from disturbance, and 4) assessment of               
              additional effects of global change on recovering ecosystems.                  
              %%%                                                                            
                   The effect of interactions among element cycling on ecosystem             
              recovery from disturbance remains a central question for ecosystem             
              ecologists.  The effects of climate change on elemental control of             
              ecosystem recovery are more poorly understood.  Improved knowledge             
              of how elemental fluxes control ecosystem recovery and how these               
              fluxes will respond to global change will be a major contribution              
              to ecology and environmental policy.  This project will address                
              these critical questions through a modeling approach that will                 
              assess sensitivity of model parameters to changing conditions                  
              during ecosystem recovery.
