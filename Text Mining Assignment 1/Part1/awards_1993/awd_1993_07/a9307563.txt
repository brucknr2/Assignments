Abstract    :
              Martin/Taussig  9307563    This project will employ ethnographic methods to
              investigate the impact of human genome research on shaping identity and related
              conceptualizations of body, community, and nation-state boundaries in the
              Netherlands.  The objectives of the project are: (1)  To investigate how
              changes in scientific and other forms of knowledge of the human genome affect
              the way people perceive biological and social identity; (2)  To examine how
              this knowledge affects conceptualizations of the body; (3)  To elucidate the
              tension between what is made possible by advances in genetics and socially
              valued conceptualizations of the self and the body; and (4)  To examine how
              scientific knowledge is produced in genetics laboratories and how the general
              population learns about and makes sense of this knowledge.  These objectives
              are designed to develop a foundation of knowledge about what a wide range of
              people think about the human genome and to understand how on-going human genome
              research affects articulations of identity and conceptualizations of the body.
