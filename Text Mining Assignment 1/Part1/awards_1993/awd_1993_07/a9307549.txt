Abstract    :
              9307549  Larter  Raima Larter and Alexander Scheeline are supported by a grant 
              from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to  study the detailed
              chemical kinetics of the peroxidase-oxidase  chemical oscillator.  Free-radical
              behavior, photochemical  effects, the role of co-factors, degradation of
              peroxidase  during reaction, reactivity of NAD dimer produced as a reaction 
              intermediate, and the consequences of acid-catalyzed  anomerization of NADH
              will be studied.  Two goals to be  addressed are: 1) to sufficiently
              characterize the chemical  dynamics so that realistic models for the reaction
              can be  devised; and 2) to better understand the chemistry of the  constiuent
              species.  Measurement tools to be employed include  oxidimetry, potentiometry,
              cyclic voltammetry,  spectrophotometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance. 
              %%%  It has been suggested that chemical oscillations may provide  the
              underlying rhythm for all types of biological oscillaitons  which have been
              observed to occur at all levels of the  metabolic process.  Many of these
              oscillations have been  explained in chemical terms.  The peroxidase-oxidase
              reaction  which is being studied by Larter and Scheeline is a very useful 
              model reaction of the biochemical processes which might  underlie rhythmic
              phenomena in living systems.  One of the  objectives of their research is to
              resolve the question whether  it is the natural enzyme kinetics or the
              unnatural features of  the in laboratory experiments which lead to the observed
               nonlinear dynamic behavior which are the source of the  oscillations in this
              system.  ***
