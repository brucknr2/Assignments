Abstract    :
              9307980  Repko       Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be
               concerned with studying the interactions among the carriers of  the weak
              nuclear force.  These forces can be probed at high  energy collisions at
              facilities such as the Superconducting Super  Collider.  The research will be
              important for an elucidation of  the origin of weak nuclear forces.  ***
