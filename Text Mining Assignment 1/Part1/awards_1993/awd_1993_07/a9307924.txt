Abstract    :
              9307924  Tate    This research investigates voter turnout and racial bloc voting
              in  mayoral elections.  Racial elections typically pit a Black  candidate
              against a White candidate and are characterized by high  voter turnouts and
              racially polarized voting.  Aggregate data from  26 major American cities will
              be collected from 1969 to 1994.  Data  on election results and registration are
              gathered from the city,  county, or state offices, while local newspaper
              accounts are used  to determine the number of races involving Black
              officeseekers.   These data will be analyzed to address the following
              questions:   First, what demographic, political, and attitudinal factors are 
              associated with high voter turnout in mayoral primaries, runoff  primaries, and
              general elections?  Second, what demographic,  political, and attitudinal
              factors are associated with racially  polarized voting in such elections?  It
              is hypothesized that the  racial composition of the city, its political
              structure, and the  political context have important contributory effects on
              turnout  and racial voting in mayoral elections in additon to the racial 
              attitudes in the community.  ***
