Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the generalization of the                 
              two well known regression models for duration times, the                       
              proportional hazards model ant the accelerated failure time                    
              model, to a mixed model with both fixed effects and a random                   
              effect.  In particular, the objective of this research is to                   
              consider score and likelihood ratio tests for the presence of the              
              random effect in the proportional hazards model and to consider                
              both a method of estimation for the regression coefficient and                 
              nonparametric likelihood estimation of the error distribution in               
              the mixed effects, accelerated failure time model.                             
                   Many areas of scientific endeavor, such as demography,                    
              duration analysis in economics, reliability in manufacturing, and              
              survival analysis in medical studies, are confronted with                      
              dependent duration times.  This research is concerned with a                   
              generalization of two often used models to a model which is more               
              realistic.
