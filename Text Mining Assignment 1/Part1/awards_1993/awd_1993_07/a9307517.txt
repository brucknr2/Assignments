Abstract    :
                   The research entails further investigations into the                      
              geometry of partial differential equations in the broader                      
              framework of the calculus of variations.  Studies on minimality                
              of hypersurfaces have applicatons to geometric models arising in               
              physics and biology.  A particular case to be studied is the                   
              Gibbs-Thomson effect relating surface interfacing and curvature.               
              Other applications to materials theory and crystallography are                 
              intended.
