Abstract    :
                   Bisch will construct and analysis irreducible subfactors of               
              the hyperfinite II_1 factor using the combinatorial aspects of                 
              subfactors and commuting squares.  He will also study connections              
              between subfactors, quantum physics, and low dimensional topology.             
              Finally, he will study subfactors of free group factors.  The key              
              technique here will be Voiculescu's free probability theory.                   
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
