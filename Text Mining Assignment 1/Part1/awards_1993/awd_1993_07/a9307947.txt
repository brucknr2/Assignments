Abstract    :
              9307947  Lauher  This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing 
              Program in support of the collaborative research of Professors  Lauher and
              Fowler at SUNY-Stonybrook. Support is provided by  the Chemistry Division. The
              objective of the research is the  development of general strategies for the
              synthesis of designed  layered organic solid-state materials. The approach is
              based on  the identification of two independent sets of functionalities  that
              will independently lead to the self-assembly of molecules  into a layered
              supramolecular network. Conceptually, the first  functionality assembles the
              molecules into one-dimensional  networks and the second unites the
              one-dimensional networks  into two-dimensional layered solids. Representative 
              functionality candidates are the dicarboxylic acids and  N,N'-disubstituted
              ureas. New persistent hydrogen bonding  motifs will be sought. The relationship
              between molecular  symmetry and crystallographic symmetry and the use of
              chirality  will be explored.  %%%  New materials with novel mechanical,
              electrical and optical  properties will be required by developing science and 
              technology. Using the tools of molecular functionality,  symmetry and chirality
              for control of supramolecular structure,  this research will provide critical
              information that will form  the basis for the design and preparation of new
              materials.  ***
