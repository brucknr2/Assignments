Abstract    :
              9307098  Balsara    This research is a study of the thermodynamic properties of
              blends  of polymethylbutene (PMB) and polyethylbutene (PEB) containing 
              polymethylbutene-polyethylbutene (PMB-PEB) block copolymers to  examine the
              possibility of forming complex fluids.  Small angle  neutron scattering and
              light scattering will be the primary tools  for this study.  The required model
              polymers will be synthesized by  "living" anionic polymerization of dienes
              under high-vacuum and  subsequent hydrogenation, or deuteration for creating
              neutron  scattering contrast.    The proposed study will consist of two stages.
               First, the  thermodynamics of mixing of PMB/PEB/PMB-PEB mixtures will be 
              obtained from small angle neutron scattering measurements on  homogeneous,
              single-phase mixtures.  These data will provide the  thermodynamic basis for
              the rational design of the dispersed phase  in phase-separated systems.  The
              second stage will consist of  examining such systems.  The evolution of the
              two-phase structures  which will be studied by time resolved small angle
              neutron  scattering and light-scattering measurements on thermodynamically 
              unstable mixtures.  The experiments are designed so that the  transition
              temperatures from single-phase to two-phase systems are  experimentally
              accessible (in the vicinity of 170 C).  The  scattering experiments will
              determine the shape and size of the  dispersed phase, the interfacial activity
              of the block copolymer,  and whether or not the morphology is at equilibrium.  
               These polymers belong to one of the largest and most important  polymer blend
              family, namely that arising from polyolefins-  polyethylene, polypropylene,
              polybutene and their copolymers.  In  spite of their commercial importance,
              there is virtually no data on  the thermodynamics of mixing of these
              multi-component systems.  ***
