Abstract    :
              9307034  Small    This project combines laser-based techniques with a new,
              practical  methodology for reproducible, well-defined fabrication of thin 
              (tens of micrometers or less) hyperquenched glassy films.  New,  powerful
              experimental techniques such as spectral hole burning and  coherent time domain
              spectroscopies will be used to develop an  adequate understanding of the
              physics of amorphous solids.  The  research deals with various aspects of the
              disorder, low-energy  excitations and low-temperature configurational
              relaxation  (tunnelling) processes of amorphous solids.  A select number of 
              organic liquids and waater will be utilized in the experimental  studies.  The
              proposed investigation can be divided into three  parts:  1) studies of
              disorder and relaxation phenomena in  hyperquenched glassy and other amorphous
              solid films; 2)  examination of temperature dependencies of thermal
              conductivity and  spectral diffusion; and 3) the probing of special
              disorder-induced,  low-frequency vibrational modes of amorphous solids.  These
              studies  on amorphous semi-conductors and superconductors and metal glasses 
              have found and will continue to find technological applications,  particularly
              because human proteins have much in common with  amorphous solids, and that the
              solution to the nuclear waste  problem may well rest on safe, million-year
              containment in doped  glasses.  Also, the results from these studies in organic
              systems  will impact experimentalists and theoreticians working on other 
              materials.  ***
