Abstract    :
              Under a Research Initiation Award the relationship between                     
              processing, microstructure and tribological behavior will be                   
              studied for copper alloy composites with chromium fiber                        
              reinforcements.  The effects of high load and velocity will be                 
              evaluated under conditions where large electrical currents pass                
              across the interface between the composite and a hardened steel                
              counterface, simulating the conditions of electrical brushes in                
              homopolar motors and similar applications.  The resistance to arc              
              erosion and to oxidation will also be evaluated.
