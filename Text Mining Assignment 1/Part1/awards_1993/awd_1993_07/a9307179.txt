Abstract    :
              9307179  Sen  This project proposes new efforts in the feedback control of
              plasma instabilities which could have relevance for a variety of plasm sources
              and devices used in the manufacturing industry.  All plasmas are subject to
              instabilities and consequent fluctuations, which cause nonunforimities in the
              plasma, increased transport, and possibly microscopic breakup.  The elimination
              of instabilities is sometimes imperative, but their suppression is always
              desirable for better performance.  The proposed modulated ion beam suppressors
              are unique truly non-perturbing remote type controllers applicable to most
              plasma devices.  State feedback and optimal control schemes proposed are
              generic control systems suitable for complex systems with many modes of
              instabilities.  Furthermore, adaptive and neural net controllers are proposed
              for the challenging problem of controlling controlling plasmas with partly
              unknown dynamics.  Lastly, the proposed study of anomalous transport (including
              its scaling behavior) addresses a fundamental open question in plasma science
              and engineering.  All the proposed studies focus on common problems and propose
              generic solutions relevant to all plasma devices, irrespective of their
              appplications.    ***
