              This award supports the visit by Xiao Wanru,                                   
              Nanjing University, to collaborate with                                        
              Professor Shivaram, University of Virginia,                                    
              on research on heavy electron superconductors.                                 
              Dr. Shivaram currently holds a grant from the NSF                              
              Division of Materials Research for a three year                                
              project on ultralow temperature tunneling studies                              
              of heavy electron superconductors.  Through                                    
              collaboration with Xiao Wanru on this project,                                 
              the principal investigator anticipates                                         
              contributions to improved superconductivity                                    
              theory.  Xiao Wanru will be responsible for                                    
              design and construction of some of the                                         
              experimental equipment and will participate with                               
              the other members of the research team in                                      
              applying her expertise in tunneling phenomena to                               
              investigate heavy electron superconductors.
