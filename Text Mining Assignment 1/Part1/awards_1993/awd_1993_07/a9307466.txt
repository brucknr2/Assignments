Abstract    :
              Sacks/Rodriguez  9307466    This project examines conflicts faced by low income
              Chicanas who work outside the home and attend school as they attempt to juggle
              work, school, and family.  While considerable research on this topic has been
              accomplished on African-American and white women little has been done on
              Chicana women.  The researchers predict that such women find themselves
              required, but unable, to fill multiple role expectations as students, workers,
              family women, and community women.  It is further hypothesized that they
              attempt to reconcile those contradictions by reconfiguring their ideal
              priorities for Chicana women and their views of the roles of Chicana women
              should play.  The researchers will compare Chicanas with radically different
              lifestyles and their experiences with constructing, interpreting, and
              reconstituting womanhood.  This project will illustrate the behavioral and
              conceptual processes by which Chicana confront the often conflicting demands of
              the dominant society and the Chicano family, and the cultural alternatives they
              develop in response.  This research will take place in Denver, Colorado in
              working class, Chicano barrios of North Denver, Auraria, and the West Side:
              neighborhoods of steadfast Chicano families who now face unprecedented economic
              change.  ***     s( t(  ext. 357 7564  U$U U U U U U U U U UCV WT        _W`i`
