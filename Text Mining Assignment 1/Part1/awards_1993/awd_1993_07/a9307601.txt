Abstract    :
              9307601  Wang       This research concerns two-scale dilation equations, which 
              describe the two-scale behavior characteristic of scaling  functions.  These
              equations arise in a wide variety of  applications, including wavelets,
              sub-division schemes for  computer generation of curves and surfaces, and
              fractal geometry  (iterated function systems - IFS). The principal investigator
               will develop techniques based on representations of the scaling  function in
              terms of an infinite matrix product expansion, which  can be used to establish
              an algorithm for constructing scaling  functions, and to analyze their
              regularity, integrability, and  dimensionality.  Thus far, in order to ensure
              convergence of the  infinite matrix product,a Contractivity Assumption has been
               imposed.  This Assumption is stronger than necessary, and the PI  is
              investigating weaker assumptions involving bounded semi-groups  of matrices,
              and an average contractivity factor as determined by  the Lyapunov exponent. 
              This also leads to questions regarding  the structure of bounded semi-groups of
              matrices.  The PI has  also developed techniques to study self-similar lattice
              tilings,  which arises from multi-dimensional orthonormal wavelets.       The
              PI intends to study the following:  (1)  surface  generation:  sliding window
              method; (2)  existence of integrable  solutions; (3) dilation equations with
              non-negative coefficients;  (4)  self-similar lattice tilings; (5)  the
              Finiteness Conjecture  of Daubechies and Lagarias.       This activity had
              substantial potential for application in  many areas, including compression
              algorithms.  ***
