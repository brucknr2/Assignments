                                  99307183  Staman  CICNet, a midlevel network supplying high
              level connectivity to the universities of the Committee on Institutional
              Cooperation (CIC) (which includes the universities of Ohio State, Michigan
              State, University of Michigan, Indiana University, University of Chicago,
              Purdue University, University of Illinois, Northwestern University, University
              of Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, and University of Iowa) and establishing
              cooperative working agreements with state networks in its region, will be
              provided funding to support the continued operation of the CICNet data network.
               The primary focus of this project is to improve the technological and
              operational aspects of CICNet and extend and expand the value of CICNet and of
              the many resources to which it provides access.  Current support for CICNET
              provides benefits for a set of academic institutions throughout seven states
              with a combined student population of over 715,000, a combined faculty
              combination of 52,000, and combined additional researchers and staff of
              approximately 150,000.  The initial award to the University of Illinois for the
              start of CICNet has provided two years of operation during which time CICNet
              has provided high ba ndwidth connectivity (1.544 million bits per second) for
              the midlevel region from Ohio to Minnesota to the NSFNET Nationwide Backbone
              Network.  Continued support for the region's network infrastructure is
              essential to both the ongoing commitment to the region's research and education
              needs and central to the success of efforts to expand services and rural
              access.  The region's bandwidth requirements will continue to grow as the
              region constitutes 20% of the Ph.D.'s in the nation's supply of science and
              engineering researchers.
