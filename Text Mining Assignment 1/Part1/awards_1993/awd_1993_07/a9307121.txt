Abstract    :
              The purpose of this Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists               
              and Engineers is to perform a preliminary investigation of the                 
              possibility of developing a procedure for detecting flaw geometries            
              in thick composite materials using nonlinear ultrasonic methods in             
              conjunction with a parametric transmitting array.
