Abstract    :
              9307816  Perk   This is a research project for the continuation of the study of
              many of the unsolved problems in the chiral Potts model, generalized chiral
              Potts models, and multi-component chiral Potts models.  These mathematical
              models describe phase transitions in experimentally realizable systems such as
              adsorption of molecules on thin films, multi-layered systems, membranes, etc. 
              In spite of many successes so far in calculating various physical quantities of
              the chiral Potts model, these results have not yet been fully explored and made
              use of.  It is intended in this project to translate the exact results into
              language more transparent to physicists, so that experts in Monte Carlo
              calculations, high- and low-temperature expansions, and various other methods,
              can use them.  The exact results can be then used to properly gauge the errors
              of the approximate methods and solve long-standing controversies.  Attempts to
              obtain new solvable models in three dimensions will be made in collaboration
              with our Russian colleague Yu.G. Stroganov.  Progress in this work may bring
              forth interaction between many other research areas in mathematics and physics
              such as quantum groups and knot theory, monopoles and string theory, phase
              transitions in condensed matter, and biomembranes in biophysics.
