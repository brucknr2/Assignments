Abstract    :
              9307487  Johnson  This proposal requests a continuation of core support to allow
               analysis and interpretation of upper mesospheric and lower  thermospheric
              measurements obtained at high latitudes with the  Sondre Stromfjord incoherent
              scatter radar, in conjunction with  complementary measurements obtained with
              other ground-based  instruments.  The proposed studies continue and extend work
               currently underway in support of the CEDAR Lower Thermospheric  Coupling Study
              and the Coordinated Analysis of the Thermosphere  initiatives.  Specifically,
              the PI proposes to continue planning,  analysis, and interpretation of
              measurements obtained during LTCS  experiments with the Sondre Stromfjord radar
              and comparisons with  other simultaneous radar and optical measurements and
              theoretical  modeling results.  ***
