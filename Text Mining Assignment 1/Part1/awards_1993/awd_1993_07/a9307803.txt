Abstract    :
              This is a travel award for an exploratory visit to the University              
              of Pittsburgh Eye and Ear Institute to visit faculty and examine               
              facilities.  This visit will enable discussion of the possibility              
              of receiving postdoctorate training and a tentative plan for                   
              postdoctoral research under Dr. Carey Balaban, who has expressed               
              an interest in serving as postdoctoral mentor.
