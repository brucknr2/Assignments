Abstract    :
              9307732  Reynolds  This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing 
              Program in support of the collaborative research of Professors  Reynolds and
              Katritzky at the University of Florida. Support is  provided by the Divisions
              of Chemistry and Materials Research.  Novel bis-2-pyrrolyl conjugated monomers
              containing substituted  benzenes, carbazoles and fluorenes as internal units
              will be  synthesized and electrochemically polymerized to highly  conducting
              polymers. The main goal of the research is to  develop a fundamental
              understanding of the  electropolymerization and film-deposition processes that
              occur  during oxidative polymerization and to direct the  electrosynthesis to
              form polymers with enhanced properties.  %%%  Polypyrroles with higher degrees
              of long range order will be  synthesized which will have higher electrical
              conductivities  and improved environmental stabilities relative to presently 
              available polymers. These aspects are important in  electrostatic charge
              dissipation and electric field grading  applications.  ***
