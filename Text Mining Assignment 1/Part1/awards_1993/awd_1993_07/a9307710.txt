Abstract    :
              9307710  Button-Shafer       This award supports participation in several
              approved and  proposed experiments which will utilize polarized and 
              unpolarized electron beams at SLAC directed onto targets at End  Station A.  An
              approved experiment, anticipated for the fall  of 1993, involves longitudinally
              polarized electrons at 22.6  GeV and polarized nucleon targets.  This
              experiment (E143)  will be the first deep-inelastic scattering experiment in
              the  United States to study the spin-dependent structure functions  of both
              proton and neutron; the data will be used to probe the  quark contributions to
              nucleon spin (to elucidate the so-call  "spin crisis").  ***
