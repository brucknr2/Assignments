Abstract    :
              9307994  Wang  The focus of this research is the development of new methods  for
              the synthesis of enediynes and enyne-allenes which provide  easy entries to a
              variety of carbon diradicals and mechanistic  studies of the subsequent radical
              processes. The first  objective is to develop the use of the condensation
              reaction of  sillylallenylboranes with acetylenic and allenic aldehydes for 
              the synthesis of enediynes and enyne-allenes having diverse  chemical
              structures. New synthetic routes to enediynes,  enyne-allenes, diene-allenes,
              enediallenes and other related  structures via the intramolecular migration
              reaction of  organoborate complexes will also be developed. The formation of 
              carbon diradicals from these unsaturated compounds will be  studied using the
              strategy of generating new types of  diradicals by intramolecularly capturing
              the initially formed  diradical with a properly situated carbon-carbon double
              or  triple bond. This will allow the radical centers to be moved  around the
              molecule and can lead to the formation of other  reactive species, such as
              o-quinodimethanes.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting  the research of Dr. Kung K. Wang of the Department of Chemistry  at
              West Virgina University. Professor Wang will focus his work  on synthetic
              methods generating new types of carbon diradicals  and the mechanistic studies
              of the subsequent radical processes  which have recently found their
              counterpart in biological  systems.  ***
