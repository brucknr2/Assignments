Abstract    :
              9307382  Coucouvanis  Professor Coucouvanis, of the University of Michigan, will
               explore synthetic inorganic chemistry with support from the  Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program.  His efforts will
              concentrate on five topics, all related by the  presence of metal-sulfur bonds.
               1)  He will explore the  synthesis of thio and oxo-thio complexes of Nb and Ta
              with  inspiration largely from analogy with the chemistry of Mo and  W.  A
              major goal will be to generate hydrido-hydrosulfido  complexes by addition of
              H2 across M=S bonds.  2)  He will  develop the catalytic degradation of SO2 by
              use of  thiomolybdate complexes.  3)  He will investigate the synthesis  of
              catecholato sulfido complexes;  this will entail  introduction of the
              catecholato group through condensations  with catechol, as well as reductive
              couplings of catecholato  complexes.  4)  He will synthesize complexes having
              sulfate and  related tetrahedral anions as bridging ligands.  In this class  of
              compounds the anions bind simultaneously to four metal  centers, and are
              assisted by hydrogen bonding from  dimethylammonium cations.  5)  He will
              design amphiphilic  supramolecules that are based on semiquinones, transition
              metal  centers, and heterometalic M4S4 cubanes.  The objective here  will be to
              obtain "molecular reactors" for the activation of  N2, O2, and CO2.  %%%  An
              important component in the advance of basic chemistry is the  ever-broadening
              scope of molecular architecture.  This is best  achieved through the efforts of
              synthetic chemists.  A  particularly fertile area of synthesis is in compounds
              that  have both metal ions and sulfur atoms.  Much has been learned  of the
              simple compounds with iron, molybdenum, and tungsten.  The present research
              will develop the basis for the chemistry  of niobium and tantalum, and it will
              explore the synthesis of  compounds that are larger and more complex.  An
              important  objective will be to synthesize compounds that combine the 
              properties of divergent subgroups, so  as to produce "molecular  reactors". 
              This work will incorporate ideas gleaned from the  study of biological enzymes.
