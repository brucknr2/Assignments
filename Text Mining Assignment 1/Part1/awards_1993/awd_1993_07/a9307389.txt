Abstract    :
              9307389  Kerrick  The objective of this exploratory project is to develop a 
              microbeam technique (~40 um spot size) for the in situ  analysis of ferric and
              ferrous iron in silicate minerals and  glasses in polished thin sections. The
              proposed technique  involves analysis by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
               of a fresh surface produced by cleaving or scraping the  material of interest
              within the high vacuum sample chamber.  Successful development of the technique
              would enable  geoscientists to study the spatial variations of feric iron  in
              compositionally zoned minerals, and it would eliminate  the need for sample
              preparation that is both time-consuming  and potentially oxidizing.  The
              analytical results would  find application in the study of redox processes and
              in  thermobarometry of metamorphic rocks.
