Abstract    :
              9307001  Wesler    With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Kit
              Wesler  will develop a curation plan for the archaeological materials  housed
              at the Wickliffe Mounds Research Center. These consist of an  artifact
              collection which includes more than 85,000 ceramics,  animal remains and
              lithics. More than 90% of the specimens bear  legible provenience labels and
              result from gridded archaeological  excavations. Although the collection is now
              available for research,  additional curation is necessary. Materials need to be
              properly  boxed and data entered into a computerized system. MS. Katherine 
              Singley, a conservation expert will visit the Center and provide  needed advice
              on which a longer term project can be based.    The Wickliffe Mounds site is a
              Mississippi period town-and-mound  complex located on the bluffs of the
              Mississippi River in Ballard  County Kentucky. It spans the period from ca.
              1100 to 1400 AD and  documents the fluorescence of the Mississippi cultures.
              Although  they did not reach a state level of organization, in pre-Columbian 
              times such groups integrated large numbers of individuals,  maintained trade
              networks which spanned large portions of the  midwest and undertook large scale
              constructions. Archaeologists  wish to know how such societies which lacked
              both writing and  wheeled vehicles developed and were maintained. Data from
              sites  such as Wickliffe therefore are of great interest. However for such 
              material to be maximally useful, it must be properly curated and  catalogued.
              This project will help to Dr. Wesler to proceed in this  direction.
