Abstract    :
              9307545  Tao  This proposal describes a project to explore a new area of 
              adaptive control and to address open problems of urgent relevance  to theory as
              well as applications: adaptive control of systems  consisting of a linear part
              and a nonsmooth nonlinear input-  output characteristic being in either an
              actuator or a sensor.   Typical examples of such nonlinear characteristics are
              dead-zone,  backlash and hysteresis.  An adaptive inverse approach is  proposed
              to control such systems to meet desired performance  specifications, which
              exploits an adaptive inverse for an unknown  nonlinearity and a linear
              controller structure  nonadaptive/adaptive for a known/unknown linear part. 
              Choices of  nonlinear models, design of adaptive inverse control algorithms, 
              stability, convergence and robustness analysis, and applications  will be
              investigated.  The results of this research will provide  new tools to handle
              unknown nonsmooth nonlinearities which are  common in practical control
              systems.   ***
