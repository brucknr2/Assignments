Abstract    :
              The principal objective of this research project is to                         
              document magmatic evolution within an exposed crustal                          
              section of a Jurassic island-arc complex that was accreted                     
              to the North American continent.  Rock units representative                    
              of the lower, middle and upper crustal levels of the Bonanza                   
              arc of Vancouver Island and others representative of                           
              preexisting  crust into which the magmatic rocks were                          
              emplaced will be studied by detailed field work, geochemical                   
              analysis, and geochemical modelling.  The study should                         
              elucidate the internal structure of the arc and the chemical                   
              evolution of arc magmas as they pass through and interact                      
              with the surrounding crust.
