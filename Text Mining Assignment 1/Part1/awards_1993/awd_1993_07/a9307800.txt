Abstract    :
              This effort is to support various activities related to the                    
              National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Integrated                     
              Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) in order to promote                
              data compatibility between agencies and improve the quality of                 
              data.  The NCES, IPEDS data will provide the National Science                  
              Foundation (NSF), an essential portion of the statistics needed                
              to give a comprehensive base of knowledge on undergraduate                     
              education.  IPEDS is a system by which data are collected from                 
              all institutions and educational organizations whose primary                   
              purpose is to provide postsecondary education.  IPEDS collects                 
              much of the information that is needed from baccalaureate or                   
              higher institutions, and it is the only source of comprehensive                
              data from two-year award institutions.  This current proposal                  
              will allow the Foundation to acquire at an early date, edited                  
              detailed data for each postsecondary institution.
