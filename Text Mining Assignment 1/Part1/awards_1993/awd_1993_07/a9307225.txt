Abstract    :
              9307225  Thorp   Factors regulating biotic communities in large rivers are
              poorly known   both because of the dearth of research on large rivers in
              general (4% of stream   studies) and because of the lack of experimental
              techniques to study these   ecosystems. The PI's hypothesize that riverine
              plankton, or potamoplankton, in   the Ohio River are physically controlled
              during period of high river discharge and   turbidity (Phase I) and relatively
              biologically controlled at other times of the year   (Phase II). This research
              will examine experimentally the importance of   vertebrate planktivory by
              emerald shiners and rotifer-copepod interactions in   Phases I and II. To do
              so, the PI's will employ unique "potamocorrals" (in situ   floating nitex
              enclosures) in four drift experiments in the Ohio River. During   these
              studies, data will be collected to test the efficacy of these enclosures  
              relative to ambient conditions.   %%%  Potamocorrals should prove useful for
              both basic and applied research, such as   the effects of energy byproducts on
              riverine plankton. Also, this research will add   much needed data on the
              effects of different disturbance agents on the   biodiversity of large river
              systems.  ***
