Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This grant provides partial support for the attendance of                 
              about twelve polymer scientists from the former Soviet Bloc at the             
              symposium on Polyelectrolytes, which will be held in Denver, from              
              28 March - 1 April 1993.  The symposium will provide a unique                  
              international forum for the discussion of this important scientific            
              subject.
