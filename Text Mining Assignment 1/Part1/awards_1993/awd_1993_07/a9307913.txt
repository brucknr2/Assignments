Abstract    :
              9307913  Backer    Studies of Compact Galactic Objects.    The three goals of
              Dr. Backer's research are (a) an exploration of the use of  an array of
              millisecond pulsars as a celestial clock ensemble; (b) a broader  understanding
              of interstellar microturbulence which affects radio signal  propagation; and
              (c) a more complete view of the radiation mechanism and  underlying dynamics in
              active galactic nuclei with a focus on our galactic  center.  Dr. Backer will
              carry out a variety of observational programs at radio  wavelengths with
              related analysis and interpretation.  The observational  programs will be
              advanced by instrumentation developed and maintained by  Dr. Backer, and used
              primarily at the National Observatories.
