Abstract    :
              9307408  Jones  The PI will conduct a comprehensive  theoretical research
              program to  study the dynamics of optical fiber  devices and characterize the
              stable  and unstable pulse propagation  conditions.  By allowing the gain 
              material to retain its full set of  variables, i.e. polarization and 
              population difference, new degrees  of freedom will be introduced into  the
              system which will play in the  generation of complex waveforms.   The PI will
              focus studies into the  threshold conditions of the system,  the dynamics of
              the gain material,  and its effect in constructing or  reshaping pulses. 
              Currently, the PI  is exploring the possibilities of  experimental
              demonstrations of these  effects with a group located within  their own laser
              center.  ***
