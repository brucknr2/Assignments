Abstract    :
              9307646  Rynn  The study of plasma physics is common to both laboratory 
              experimentalists and space experimentalists; yet the interchange  between these
              two groups is infrequent.  We are orgainizing a  second workshop for these two
              communities to discuss experiment,  simulations, and theory of common interest.
               The subjects chosen will emphasize areas where progress is being  made both in
              the laboratory and space.  These include topics such  as: Critical Velocity,
              Reconnection, Ion Cyclotron Waves, Beam  Drive Instabilities, Anomalous
              Resistivity, Double Layers,  Collisionless Shocks, Non-linear and Kinetic
              alfven Waves, Active  Space Experiments, Turbulence and Transport.  The need
              for these two communities to interact more closely has  already been recognized
              by the AGU which held a 1 day special  session at the December 1990 AGU
              Meeting.  We also held a  successful meeting in Alpbach, Austria July 1-6,
              1991.  Our meeting  will occupy 5 days in a setting where all participants will
              eat  together and be housed nearby.  In this manner we can expect both  a more
              extended and more intense synergistic interaction between  the participants
              than the AGU meeting will offer.    There will be two sessions each day.  Each
              session will begin with  invited speakers and will continue with contributed
              papers.  Poster  papers will also be included if the response warrants this 
              approach.  We expect that the attendees will be primairly  specialist from2 the
              laboratory and space communities.  Some  advanced graduate students will also
              attend.  ***
