Abstract    :
                   Research in neutrino oscillations and neutrino scattering                 
              and reactions will be carried out at Los Alamos using LAMPF beam               
              stops as a source of neutrinos.  Louisiana Tech will have                      
              responsibility for developing beam line monitoring equipment so                
              that neutrino events in the LSND detector can be correlated with               
              the time structure of the primary proton beam.  Time-of-flight                 
              information will be used to reduce backgrounds and rule out other              
              competing processes.  The group will participate in all phases of              
              the experiment, from design of hardware, to data acquisition, to               
              data analysis.
