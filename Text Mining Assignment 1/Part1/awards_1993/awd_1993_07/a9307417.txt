Abstract    :
              9307417    Skorin-Kapov         The main objective of the research is to
              increase the    solvability of nonlinear integer programming problems.  The
              primary  direction of research is the development, enhancement and efficient 
              implementation of heuristic search approaches for some NP-hard    combinatorial
              optimization problems.  Specifically, ideas and    methods from artificial
              intelligence, such as informed best-first  strategies and AND/OR graphs, will
              be utilized within the framework  of integer programming algorithms.  Special
              emphasis will be given  to a design of parallel algorithms.         The work on
              heuristic methods will include a design of    improved criteria for measuring
              the quality of the heuristic    solution.  In this context the impact of
              changes in the initial   data on the heuristic solution will be investigated. 
              Increasing  the solvability of nonlinear inter programming problems and placing
               them in a dynamic environment by studying the impact of data    changes on the
              solution, will broaden the applicability of such   mathematical models to a
              number of problems arising in engineering  and modern technology.
