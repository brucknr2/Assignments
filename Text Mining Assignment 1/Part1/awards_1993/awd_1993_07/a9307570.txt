              Sorkin          This project will pursue research in "quantum gravity", which
              is the important problem of finding a theory in which the behavior of the
              gravitational field is characterized by a quantum randomness instead of by the
              deterministic evolution of the classical Einstein theory.  One knows such
              randomness is necessary for consistency, since the known unpredictability of
              matter (for example, the quantum jumps which occur within atoms) must
              necessarily give rise to a corresponding unpredictability in the gravitational
              fields produced by the matter.  When a theory of quantum gravity is found one
              may expect to understand what happens to objects which fall into black holes,
              and to understand what made the cosmological "big bang" take the form that it
              did.          The approach Prof. Sorkin will follow is based on the hypothesis
              that spacetime has an "atomic" structure, being what technically is called a
              causal set.  At the current stage of development of this theory a central
              question in understanding how the spacetime "atoms" interact with each other,
              is that of l earning which sort of interaction can avoid producing the
              impression of action at a distance (which would conflict with established
              physical laws).  Prof. Sorkin will study this question using computer
              simulations of fields like the electromagnetic field propagating on a causal
              set.  Progress in this effort will be a significant step toward a full
              formulation of causal set dynamics using Feynman's sum over histories method. 
              It might also provide a novel method which one could apply to computer
              simulations of other problems of physical importance, such as predicting the
              masses of e  lementary particles like the proton. ***
