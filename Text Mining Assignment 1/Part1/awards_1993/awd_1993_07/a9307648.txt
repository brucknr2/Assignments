Abstract    :
                   The research entails studying the moduli spaces arising in                
              Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions with respect to their                     
              natural metrics.  These investigations are related to the                      
              topological structures on the underlying manifold.  Applications               
              to semiclassical approximation in quantum field theory and other               
              areas of mathematical physics are envisaged.
