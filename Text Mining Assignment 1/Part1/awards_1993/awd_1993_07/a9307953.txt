Abstract    :
              The Office of Naval Research (ONR) will receive cost sharing to co-            
              sponsor an instrument development project at Columbia University,              
              Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, under the direction of Dr.              
              John Marra.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The project will develop and field test a new type of spectro-                 
              radiometer for irradiance measurements in the ocean.  It will be               
              optimized for use on moorings, but profiling the sensor through the            
              water column will also be possible.  The new radiometer will have              
              several advantages over presently available instruments.  It will              
              cost less than instruments now required to make spectral irradiance            
              measurements as a function of depth.  More wavelengths will be                 
              covered (32 from 400-700 nm), thus providing a more accurate                   
              spectrum of underwater irradiance measurements than is now pract-              
              icable The new instrument will also be smaller and easier to use.              
              High quality spectral irradiance measurements are important in a               
              number of ocean science investigations within several disciplines,             
              that deal with the energy budget and other parameters.in the upper             
              ocean.
