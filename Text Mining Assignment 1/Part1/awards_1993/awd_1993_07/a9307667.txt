Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop the chemistry of                      
              1,2,3-vicinal tricarbonyl compounds as electrophilic centers                   
              for bond-forming, bond cleavage and rearrangement reactions                    
              having synthetic applicability.  The preparation of a range of                 
              heterocycles including alpha-keto lactams, hydroxyfurans,                      
              hydroxypyrroles, pryrrolizidines, indolizidines, fused ring                    
              beta-lactams and macrocyclic lactones and lactams will be                      
              pursued.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Harry H. Wasserman of the Department of                    
              Chemistry at Yale University.  Professor Wasserman will focus                  
              his work on the chemistry of compounds containing three                        
              consecutive carbonyl groups, the 1,2,3-vicinal tricarbonyls.                   
              These compounds are synthetic intermediates for the preparation                
              of a wide range of organic compounds including systems of                      
              biological significance.
