Abstract    :
              9307849  Bray    The theme of this research project is the use of high pressure
              to  alter the dopant-lattice and dopant-dopant interactions  responsible for
              defining optical properties of YAG doped with  Cr3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+, separately
              and in combination.  Pressure  will be used to perturb the local bonding
              environments of Cr3+,  Tm3+, and Ho3+ in YAG, and experiments will be conducted
              to  monitor the effects of pressure on optical properties.  The  effect of
              pressure on the dopant bonding environment will be  characterized so that
              structure-property correlations for YAG  based solid state laser materials can
              be developed.  Absorption,  excitation, cw photoluminescence, and time-resolved
               photoluminescence experiments will be performed as a function of  pressure. 
              The effect of pressure on energy levels and  splittings, optical transition
              intensities, luminescence  lifetimes and efficiencies, and ion-ion energy
              transfer processes  will be characterized.  Processes to be studied include 
              Cr3+-Tm3+, Cr3+-Ho3+, and Tm3+-Ho3+ energy transfer, Tm3+-Tm3+  energy
              migration and cross-relaxation, and Ho3+ upconversion.  %%%  This research aims
              to improve fundamental understanding of solid  state laser materials.  These
              materials are important in  applications in the areas of medicine, optical
              fiber  communications, solar energy, and imaging.  High pressure will be  used
              to modify material structure, and changes in optical  properties as a function
              of pressure will be studied  experimentally.  The research is expected to
              provide the  molecular information needed to understand the relationship of 
              chemical composition and structure to the laser properties of  garnet based
              materials.  ***
