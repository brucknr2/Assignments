Abstract    :
                   Forest landscapes are increasingly fragmented.  This project              
              will explore an important mechanism of forest response to this                 
              fragmentation.  The objectives of the proposed research are to 1)              
              determine experimentally whether edges inhibit, facilitate, or have            
              no net effect on the exogenous control of forest interior dynamics;            
              and 2) to determine the specific mechanisms for the interaction                
              between forest edge and interior, and the surrounding landscape.               
              The study uses exotic species that are not common in forest                    
              interiors as indicators of external influence, & examines relevant             
              processes, including seed input, seed storage, seed and seedling               
              survival, role of seedling predation, and role of fine scale                   
              disturbances.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The interaction between forest islands and the surrounding                     
              landscape may occur principally through forest edges.  Yet,                    
              existing research does not indicate how edges work to control the              
              input and survival of tree seedlings in the forest interior.  Plant            
              dispersal and plant-animal interactions across forest edges play a             
              key role in forest dynamics in fragmented landscapes.  The                     
              information will be relevant to management of forest fragments,                
              restoration and conservation of forests in fragmented landscapes,              
              and monitoring and compensating for the effects of global                      
              environmental change on fragmented forests.
