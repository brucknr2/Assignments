              can be used to study in breeding depression and hybrid breakdown.  The genetic
              basis of inbreeding dpression is an unanswered question with implications for
              many problems in agriculture and genetics.  For example, hybrid vigor
              (avoidance of inbreeding depression) is responsible for a large portion of the
              increases in crop yield obtained by plant breeders.  Crosses between distantly
              related populations may produce offspring with reduces fitness (hybrid
              breakdown).  Phenotypic plasticity and genotype environment interaction may
              also be important in agricultural and wild species.  Despite many years of
              inquiry, the genetic basis of these phenomena remains unclear. %%% Using
              recently developed techniquesin molecular biology it is now feasible to
              elucidate the genetic basis of ombreeding depression and outbreeding
              depression.  This technology will be used to ask 1) What causes hybrid vigor?
              2) Does genotype environment interaction contribute to hybrid vigor? 3) How do
              changes in gene expression cause genotype environment interaction? 4) What
              causes hybrid breakdown?  This research will have important implications for
              understanding the genetics of agricultural and natural populations.
