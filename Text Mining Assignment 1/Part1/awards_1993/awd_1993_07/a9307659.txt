Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor Bernasconi at the University of California, Santa Cruz               
              to study asynchronous transition states of proton transfer and                 
              nucleophilic addition and substitution reactions using the                     
              principle of nonperfect synchronization. The specific targets                  
              are: (a) to separate the polarizability and resonance effects in               
              sulfur and phosphorus substituted anions, (b) to study proton                  
              transfer from carbon to carbon by experiment and theory, and (c)               
              to study the influence of metallic substitution on proton                      
              transfer barriers as well as the more general area of                          
              nucleophilic additions to the C=M double bonds of Fischer                      
              carbene complexes.                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project Professor Bernasconi will employ his empirical                 
              theory, the principle of nonperfect synchronization, to study                  
              asynchronous proton transfer reactions and additions to Fischer                
              carbene complexes. The application of his physical organic                     
              methodology to the ubiquitous chemistry of metal carbenes will                 
              fill an important void.
