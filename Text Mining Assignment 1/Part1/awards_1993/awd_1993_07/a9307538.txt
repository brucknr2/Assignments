Abstract    :
              Tong         A research program on the use of single stuck-at-fault test  sets
              (SSFTS) to detect multiple faults and their combinations in  CMOS VLSI circuits
              is being planned.  Preliminary results are  being simulated and extended to
              more complex fault conditions.   Also, circuits under consideration are being
              expanded from  combinational to sequential circuits, both synchronous and 
              asynchronous.  A fault model that permits use of both voltage and  current in
              detecting faults is being formulated.
