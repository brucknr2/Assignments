Abstract    :
              9307107  Frost  The focus of this research will be the synthesis of indigo and 
              adipic acid using Escerichia coli as catalysts and D-glucose as  starting
              material.  The steps proposed for the biocatalytic  syntheses are carried out
              in water at temperatures not to  exceed 37 degrees Centigrade.  No greenhouse
              or ozone-depleting  gases will be generated in contrast to currently used 
              methodology.  %%%  With this Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and 
              Processing award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research of
              Dr. John W. Frost of the Department of  Chemistry at Purdue University. 
              Professor Frost will focus his  work on the synthesis of indigo and adipic acid
              by using  biocatalysts to eliminate materials derived from fossil fuels, 
              toxins and elevated reaction temperatures from the synthetic  scheme.  ***
