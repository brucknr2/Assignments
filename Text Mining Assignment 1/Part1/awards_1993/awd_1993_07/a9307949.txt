Abstract    :
                                          ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              Because in social life there are ties or linkages between                      
              persons, scores of persons are nonindependent or related. For                  
              instance, children in classrooms are linked together by                        
              friendship and spatial proximity. Although specialized models on               
              nonindependence have been developed (e.g., the Social Relations                
              Model), a general approach to the estimation and testing for                   
              interdependence has yet to be developed. There is as yet no                    
              general approach to the measurement of the strength of the ties                
              between people. This research explicates such an approach. A                   
              statistical model will be developed, an interactive computer                   
              program will be written, and the software will be evaluated using              
              previously collected data. This will enable us to estimate the                 
              strength of ties for designs in which we already have methods,                 
              for designs we currently know of but do not yet know how to                    
              estimate linkage, as well as for designs that have yet to be                   
              discovered. The work should be useful to many areas in social                  
              psychology: social influence, small group research, intergroup                 
              relations, interpersonal perception, social support, and personal              
              relationships.
