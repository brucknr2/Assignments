Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9307485  Garrison    This award from the Chemistry  Research 
              Instrumentation  Program  will assist the Department of Chemistry at
              Pennsylvania State University  in the purchase of a Spectroscopic Facility for
              chemical research.  At  the heart of this facility are two argon ion
              laser-pumped tunable laser  systems and a triple monochrometer.  Included in
              the research to be  done with this equipment are:    1)  Effects of optical
              orientation on chemical equilibria and state  selective photodissociation,  2) 
              Time resolved fluorescence studies of the dynamics of solvation in  polar
              fluids,  3)  Resonance Raman studies of molecular association and of solvent
              effects  on electronic states,  4)  Near infrared surface-enhanced Raman
              scattering (SERS) studies of  assemblies of colloidal monolayers of gold
              particles, and time-gated  surface-enhanced Resonance Raman scattering (SERRS)
              studies,  5)  Electron and energy transfer reactions at interfaces,  6) 
              Plasmon-enhanced surface Raman scattering of self-assembled  monolayers.    The
              requested instrumentation will satisfy a critical need that has  resulted from
              the addition of new faculty and from new research  developments within the
              Department of Chemistry.  %%%  A laser spectroscopic facility can provide
              important information  about molecular structure, molecular interactions and
              molecular dynamics  in solution and on surfaces.  This sort of information is
              necessary for a  basic understanding of chemical reactions.  ***
