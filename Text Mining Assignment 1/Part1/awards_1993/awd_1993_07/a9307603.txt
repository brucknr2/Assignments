Abstract    :
              Seinfeld    9307603       Gas-to-particle conversion is a ubiquitous process in
              the  atmosphere, understanding the detailed chemistry and physics of  which
              will allow one to predict the effects of primary gaseous and  particulate
              emissions on airborne particulate matter composition  and size.  This
              comprehensive research program determine the  mechanisms of secondary organic
              aerosols formation in the  atmosphere for a number of important anthropogenic
              and biogenic  hydrocarbons.  Experiments in a 1000 liter indoor reactor will be
               used to probe gas-phase photooxidation mechanisms.  A 4 m3 outdoor  smog
              chamber will be used to generate organic aerosols for  molecular speciation
              analysis by gas chromatography/mass  spectrometry, while the 60 m3 outdoor smog
              chamber will be employed  to study the integrated gas-phased and
              gas-to-particle conversion  dynamics.  Vapor pressures of individual secondary
              organic aerosol  constituents and of the aerosol generated by hydrocarbon 
              photooxidation will be determined with the tandem differential  mobility
              analyzer (TDMA).  Information from the individual  experiments studies will be
              integrated in the data analysis phase.   Gas-phase photooxidation mechanisms
              will be formulated and aerosol  physics models will be developed based on the
              concentration  dynamics, molecular speciation, and the physical properties
              deduced  from the TDMA studies.
