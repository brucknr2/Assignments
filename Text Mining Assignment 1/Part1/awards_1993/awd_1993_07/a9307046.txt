Abstract    :
              9307046  Jokipii       This proposal seeks three years of continued support for
              a  program of theoretical studies of a range of basic solar-wind  properties
              and their interactions with cosmic rays.  In this  continuing program, the
              investigations undertaken will include  studies of the large-scale morphology
              of the interplanetary  magnetic field and plasma, with particular emphasis
              given to the  effect of the field's structure on cosmic-ray and energetic- 
              particle acceleration, propagation and anisotropies.  A new part of  this study
              will include a study of how cosmic rays can affect fluid  flows such as the
              solar wind and perhaps even help accelerate the  solar wind near the Sun.  ***
