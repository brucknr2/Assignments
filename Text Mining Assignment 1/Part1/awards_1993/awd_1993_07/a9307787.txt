Abstract    :
              9307787  Houston  When collapsible soils area wetted they fail  and produce 
              differential settlement which  may damage structures.  The purpose of the 
              project is to: further refine a down-hole  in-situ test developed in a previous
              project,  so it can be used inside the hollow stem  auger; develop techniques
              for predicting the  extent and intensity of wetting due to  accidental wetting;
              enhance the understanding  of the flow mechanisms when water infiltrates  an
              initially dry soil; and develop techniques  for combined wetting and mud
              jacking for the  mitigation of collapsing soils under   existing structures. 
              The results of this  research will improve  the basic  understanding of the
              behavior of collapsible  soils under certain conditions and this new  knowledge
              will directly  benefit the  geotechnical engineering practice.  ***
