Abstract    :
              This is a Planning Grant in the Research Opportunities for Women               
              program.  It supports a one-year planning effort for research in               
              three-dimensional methods for brain tumor volume detection in                  
              cross-sectional medical imagery and in particular, x-ray computed              
              tomography and magnetic resonance images.   The planning effort                
              will address problem formulation and image data collection,                    
              knowledge collection and representation, and feasibility studies of            
              3-D segmentation techniques.  The ultimate objective of the                    
              research being planned is to automate the detection of brain tumor             
              volume.
