Abstract    :
              9307750  Feher  This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic 
              Chemistry Program supports research on silica-supported  catalysts by Dr. Frank
              J. Feher of the Chemistry Department,  University of California at Irvine. 
              Three projects involving  metallasilsesquioxanes will be pursued.  The
              reactivity of  molybdenum, tungsten, and rhenium-containing silsesquioxanes as 
              olefin metathesis catalysts will be investigated, with  particular emphasis on
              determining the effect of varying the  M-O-Si bond angle.  The chemistry of
              platinum group metals in  highly siliceous environments will be compared to
              their  behavior in more traditional ligand environments.  New  surface-modified
              silicas and silica-supported catalysts will be  prepared to test the results of
              model studies in solution with  the chemistry of heterogeneous catalysts.  %%% 
              Because silica (sand) is an amorphous insoluble material, it is  difficult to
              study.  Incompletely-condensed clusters of silicon  and oxygen, called
              silsesquioxanes, are used here to mimic the  hydroxylated surfaces of silica. 
              In catalytic applications, in  which silica is used as a support material for
              metals,  reactions at the surface are important in the catalytic  activity.  An
              advantage of the silsesquioxanes is that they can  be dissolved in many common
              organic solvents, thus allowing  detailed studies using many of the powerful
              analytical  techniques used to study molecules in solution.  In this  project,
              reactions which model surface reactions of silica and  silica-supported
              catalysts will be carried out and the insights  obtained will be tested on new
              heterogeneous catalysts.  ***
