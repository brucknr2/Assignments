Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding to modernize the thermal              
              ionization source mass spectrometer system operated in the Division            
              of Geological and Planetary Sciences at the California Institute               
              of Technology. The upgrade will include replacement and correction             
              of ion collectors which have degraded during the intensive use of              
              the spectrometer during the last six years and construction of a               
              new filament source system. In addition, the award will also be                
              used to partially fund the acquisition of equipment to improve the             
              Division's mineral separation laboratory. The California Institute             
              of Technology is committed to providing matching support. Several              
              research groups in the Geological and Planetary Division at Caltech            
              make extensive use of these facilities in research projects                    
              spanning a broad spectrum of interest in petrogenesis, tectonics               
              and geodynamics of continental crusts and margins, geological                  
              hazards, and environmental geochemistry.
