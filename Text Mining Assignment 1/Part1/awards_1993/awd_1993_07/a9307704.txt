Abstract    :
                      9307704  HARGUS  The disappearance Native American languages is a
              serious  problem, requiring both scientific documentation and  revitalization
              efforts. This is a linguistic study of the  verbal morphology, phonology and
              syntax of a subarctic  Athabascan Indian language (Babine-Witsu Wit'en) still 
              spoken in British Columbia, Canada. The objective of the  study is to provide a
              model of the morphological structure  of verbs based on an understanding of the
              interaction of  verbal morphology with syntax and phonology. Research will  be
              conducted through native speaker interviews. Local  objectives are to stimulate
              interest in linguistics among  native speakers and to facilitate language
              pedagogical  efforts throughout this language area.  ***
