Abstract    :
              9307247  Cook    The goal of this research is to understand how animals,
              including humans, rapidly  see and recognize visual objects.  Dr. Cook's new
              research elaborates on his prior  NSF-supported research looking at the
              perception and processing of textured  stimuli by pigeons.  These birds are
              ideal for comparative visual studies because  the demands for accurate and
              rapid perception during flight, in conjunction with  the need to minimize body
              weight, have caused them to evolve very small, but  powerful, visual systems. 
              This makes them a rich source of comparative  information about how small
              nervous systems solve the very complex problems of  perception.  In conjunction
              with research investigating humans and other animals,  the results will help to
              identify those general rules and mechanisms shared by  many species and those
              that are unique.  One implication of the prior work was  that the early stages
              of visual processing in pigeons and humans share many  common characteristics. 
              The new research continues to examine this issue by  investigating the
              contributions of stimulus-driven and subject-driven processes in  the
              discrimination of multi-element stimuli by pigeons, and by humans when 
              appropriate.  Besides its psychological implications, information from this
              research  will have potential practical applications in the engineering of
              small, self-  sufficient, intelligent robots and the development of compact
              visual prostheses for  the visually impaired.
