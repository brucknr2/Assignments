Abstract    :
              Partitioning of large designs into smaller and more manageable                 
              parts is a very important design task.  In high-level synthesis of             
              register-transfer level designs, partitioning the specification is             
              done prior to synthesizing the designs.  If the input specification            
              is control-dominated, the specification is partitioned into a set              
              of states, or if the specification is data-dominated then it is                
              partitioned into a set of graphs.  In either case, the sets of the             
              partition are synthesized independently and the complete design                
              assembled together.  This research re-examines the partitioning                
              problem, outlines some concerns with existing techniques and                   
              presents a fresh approach to formulating and solving the                       
              partitioning problem.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Specifically, the effort focuses on a data-path model which can be             
              used for rapid-prototyping at the register-transfer level design               
              and for partitioning of the input specification.  The solution to              
              these problems is achieved by scheduling the input specificiation              
              onto the data-path model.  The scheduling result can then be                   
              interpreted from a rapid-prototyping perspective or from a                     
              partitioning perspective as desired by the designer.  This method              
              will handle several new constraints such as communication and                  
              memory/register bank constraints, integrate floor planning with                
              high-level design tools, and will accept a more complete input                 
              specification including loops and conditional branches.  Our method            
              will allow the designer to make tradeoffs which were hitherto not              
              possible.  An example is tradeoffs between communication overheads             
              and performance of the design.
