Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this proposed research is exploring                        
              hypotheses in immunology at the mathematical level.  The                       
              emphasis will focus on chemotherapy treatments to help answer                  
              controversies regarding early disease stage treatment versus                   
              late, large dosage versus small, duration of treatment, side                   
              effects, scheduling, and resistance. We can explore these                      
              questions for a variety of diseases ({\it e.g.} AIDS, cancer,                  
              etc.).  We use differential equations to describe these dynamics               
              and examine them both analytically and numerically.
