Abstract    :
              9307614  Soom    Description:  This project supports the  participation of a
              U.S. delegation in the first  Heat and Mass Transfer Conference organized 
              jointly be the Indian Society of Heat and Mass  Transfer (ISHMT) and the
              American Society of  Mechanical Engineering (ASME).  The conference  will be
              held at the Bhabha Atomic Research  Center (BARC) in Bombay between January 5
              and  7, 1994.  The American scientists are expected  to participate in panel
              discussions on research  and graduate education in the U.S. and India,  and on
              university-industry cooperative research  in the two countries.  They will also
              conduct a  symposium on modern developments in boiling and  condensation, and
              will present state-of -the-  art review lectures on topics of emerging 
              technologies.  They will give courses on  experimental methods in heat
              transfer, heat  transfer in manufacturing and material  processing, and thermal
              resistance in  electronic systems.  The U.S. scientists plan  to selectively
              visit Indian research institutes  including BARC and four of the Indian 
              Institutes of Technology.      Scope:  This project will help develop close 
              ties between researchers in the U.S. and India  for exchange of technical
              information and for  conducting cooperative research projects of  mutual
              interest.  This meeting in India is  similar to others organized by the ASME
              with  counterpart organizations in China, South  Korea, Japan and Europe. 
              India has a very  strong community of researchers in this  particular field of
              heat and mass transfer, and  it is likely that the U.S. participants will 
              benefit from attending this conference.  ***
