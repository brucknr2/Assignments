Abstract    :
              9307114  Czarnetzki         This project seeks to install a network of three
              low-cost  computers to run an OS/2-based UNIDATA PC-McIDAS system.  This 
              network will become an integral component of the existing  meteorology course
              offerings, would provide the needed  sophistication for the development of
              additional atmospheric  science courses, and will provide data which could be
              used to  initiate or enhance research projects.  The UNIDATA network will  also
              make substantial contributions to computer literacy  initiatives in progress at
              the University of Northern Iowa.  ***
