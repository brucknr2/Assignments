Abstract    :
              9307731  Bledsoe  This renewal project continues the effort to build more
              powerful  theorem provers with automated proof discovery as the central  focus.
               The principal problem domain is mathematics with offers a  rich source of
              theorems that automated provers cannot yet prove.  Methods developed for
              mathematics apply to many areas, such as  reasoning in expert systems,
              inference in large databases,  program verification, reverse engineering,
              factory automation,  etc.    The work focuses on basic heuristic methods either
              modelled from  human behavior or discovered through analysis of individually 
              targeted domains.  Specifically, the research focuses on "large-  step"
              methods, second order logic, analogy, proof plans or  scripts, interactive
              theorem proving, and the combining of these  efforts    Implementation of
              analogy in automatic proof discovery remains an  important long term goal. 
              Analogy as used by mathematicians is  an extremely powerful proof methodology. 
              This project uses proof  plans and scripts, and centers on proving a few very
              difficult  theorems with analogy.  ***
