Abstract    :
              9307658 Huntly          This research combines theory and experiments to define
              and measure  the mechanisms by which fluctuating environmental factors (e.g.,
              temporal  variation in weather patterns, spatial variation in soil water or
              nitrogen content)  influence coexistence, using desert annual plants of the
              Chihuahuan Desert as a  test case. The PI's will focus on an integrated
              examination of effects of  environmental variability at several temporal
              scales, both within and between  years, and on simultaneous measurements of the
              effects of several different  mechanisms of coexistence, two being dependent on
              variable environmental  conditions and one being classical niche differences.
              The PI's  combine  development of models of germination and growth of desert
              annual plants with  field and laboratory experiments designed to measure
              responses of plants to  within- and among-year patterns of temperature and
              resource availability, and to  detect non-linear competitive interactions.  %%%
              A sound understanding of the role of environmental variability in the dynamics 
              and diversity of communities is needed, as is a framework for understanding the
               contributions of multiple factors to species coexistence. This research will 
              provide a better understanding of species coexistence in variable environments 
              mediated by multiple interactions, and increase our understanding of the
              ecology  and coexistence of desert annual plants. ***
