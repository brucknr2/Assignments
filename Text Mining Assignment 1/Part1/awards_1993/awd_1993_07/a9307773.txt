Abstract    :
              It is proposed to apply the chaos theory to mixing of particle                 
              systems, without and with an interstitial liquid, and to develop               
              and experimental approach to quantify the mixture performance                  
              in a simple flow configuration.  Mixing of particle systems is                 
              significant different from mixing of fluids due to the                         
              segregation and secondary phenomena caused by interparticle                    
              interactions.  Even if mixing plays an important role in                       
              chemical, petroleum, mining and pharmaceutical processes, no                   
              reliable theory with a larger range of generality has been                     
              developed.  The proposed approach offers a sound background for                
              developing a chaos based theory, and a simple device for model                 
              calibration and testing.  Several technological improvements are               
              expected by the introduction of various disturbances which would               
              enhance mixing of particulates.  The research project to be                    
              focused on the differences between single fluid mixing and                     
              particulate mixing, and on the generic aspects which can be                    
              obtained from the experiments on the proposed device.  The                     
              feasibility of the chaos theory applied to particulate mixing                  
              is a main goal of this project.
