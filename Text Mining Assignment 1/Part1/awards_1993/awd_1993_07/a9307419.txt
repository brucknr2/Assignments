Abstract    :
              9307419 Zhang The objective of this research plan is to develop a new
              optoelectronic technique for the characterization of semiconductors.  The new
              technique offers coherent measurement of the electronic properties of surfaces
              and interfaces, as well as carrier dynamics (both phase and amplitude).  The
              technique consists of using a femtosecond laser to illuminate semiconductors,
              and measuring the electromagnetic radiation produced by the rapid current
              transients due to optical injection of free carriers into static electric and
              magnetic fields in the semiconductors.  By measuring the time domain waveform
              of the radiated electric field, the strength and direction of the static
              electric field can be determined with a non contact approach.  A direct
              application is studying the formation dynamics of the static fields of
              semiconductor surfaces and interfaces on as grown samples.  The influence of
              the interface fields (both field direction and strength) on the semiconductor
              can be monitored directly.  During monolayer epitaxial growth, surface
              electrochemical passivation, ultrathin metallic layer deposition, as well as
              when the sample goes from the liquid helium temperature to its melting
              temperature.  Phenomena such as virtual carrier population associated with the
              interface field and carrier transport (picosecond quantum Hall effect) at high
              magnetic fields will be elaborated upon. ***
