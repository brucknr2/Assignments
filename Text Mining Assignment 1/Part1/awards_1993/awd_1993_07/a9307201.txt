              Abstract  ATM-9307201  Whitlock, Cathy W.  Title:  Response of the Pacific
              Northwest to Large-scale Changes in  Climate during the Last 150,000 Years   
              This award supports a study of the paleoclimatic history of the  Pacific
              Northwest during the last 150 kyr and to examine the causes  of past climatic
              change.  The research is based on the emerging  relationships between the
              large-scale controls that governed  climatic variations during the last 20 kyr
              and the effect of those  controls within a particular region.  These
              relationships allow  hypotheses to be generated that describe how the varying 
              combination of controls over the last 150 kyr may have governed  regional
              paleoclimatic responses.  The hypotheses will be tested  using the long records
              obtained in this study.  The results of this  investigation will:         -
              document the paleoclimatic history of the Pacific Northwest            of the
              last 150 kyr;         - elucidate the large-scale controls responsible for
              regional            paleoclimatic variations;         - clarify the nature and
              extent of abrupt climatic events that            punctuated the last
              glacial-interglacial cycle; and         - provide critical land-sea comparisons
              that will help            disclose the long-term interactions among atmospheric
              and            oceanic circulation, hydrology, and biota in the Pacific        
                 Northwest
