Abstract    :
                  This work investigates a broad spectrum of problems dealing with  logic in
              computer science that span finite model theory,  database theory,  complexity
              theory, and optimization theory.  The question of whether or not  certain
              important algorithmic  problems are expressible in various logical query 
              languages,  such as Datalog and extensions of Datalog with negation, are 
              examined. Further, the relationship between first-  order logic, fixpoint
              logic,  and polynomial-time  computability on arbitrary classes of finite
              structures  are explored.  In the area of logical definability and  asymptotic 
              probabilities, 0-1 laws are investigated for certain powerful extensions of 
              fixpoint logic and an attempt is made to find necessary and   sufficient
              conditions for the  existence of 0-1 laws under variable   probability
              measures.  In a different line of investigation,   the descriptive  complexity
              of optimization problems  continues to be developed.  An attempt is made   to
              determine if there is  an effective syntax for   the approximable NP
              optimization  problems and to seek  structural explanations for the diverse 
              behavior of polynomial-time  optimization problems with respect to parallel
              approximation.
