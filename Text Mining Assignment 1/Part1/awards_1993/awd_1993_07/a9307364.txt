Abstract    :
                   Dimensional tolerancing and metrology are extremely important             
              manufacturing technologies.  They are key elements of the Federal              
              Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering and Technology                    
              (FCCSET) Taxonomy of Technologies for Advanced Manufacturing                   
              Research and Development (R&D), and are critical to the                        
              internationalization of United States industry.  This forum will               
              serve the useful purposes of: (1) helping to define the                        
              progress to date on emerging standards; (2) delineating the current            
              key research problems; (3) enlarging the pool of involved,                     
              knowledgeable researchers, users, and teachers; and (4) yielding               
              an archival record useful to a growing community in industry and               
              the universities.
