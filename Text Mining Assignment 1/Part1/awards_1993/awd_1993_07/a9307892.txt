Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor J. Li to work              
              in algebraic geometry.  He will study moduli spaces of vector                  
              bundles on algebraic surfaces. In particular he will study the                 
              Kodaira dimension, the Picard group, the Donaldson polynomial                  
              invariants as well as moduli spaces for higher rank bundles.                   
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the            
              oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the             
              point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have            
              stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the             
              plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the             
              field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis               
              and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those                   
              fields.  Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse             
              as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding                 
              theory and robotics.
