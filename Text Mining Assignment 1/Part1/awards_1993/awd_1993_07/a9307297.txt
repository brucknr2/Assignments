Abstract    :
                   The research entails applying methods of the Ricci flow to                
              problems in Kaehler geometry.  Particular cases are complete                   
              Kaehler manifolds of positive bisectional curvature and analysis               
              of the Ricci flow method to establish the existence of Kaehler-                
              Einstein metrics.  In addition to this, the investigator wishes                
              to study questions concerning the existence of Kaehler-Ricci                   
              solutions on Hermitian manifolds.
