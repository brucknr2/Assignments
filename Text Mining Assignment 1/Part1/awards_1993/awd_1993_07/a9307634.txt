Abstract    :
              9307634  Doherty    A one-day symposium entitled "Acoustic Communication in
              Anurans and Insects:  Common  Mechanisms in Behavior, Neurophysiology and
              Evolution" will be held as part of the  national meeting of the American
              Society of Zoologists, December 27-30, 1993.  Frogs and  insects can be quite
              similar in their modes of sound communication.  In both taxa, males  produce
              sounds that elicit a response in other males or in potential female mates. 
              These  responses may be sounds or movements towards or away from the sound
              source.  There is  clear convergence in the research methods used by scientists
              studying the physiological and  evolutionary mechanisms of acoustic
              communication in frogs and insects.  This symposium  will bring together
              researchers in anuran and insect sound communication to identify  similarities
              and differences in the behavioral, neurophysiological and evolutionary 
              mechanisms of acoustic communication in anurans and insects.  Topics will
              include  chorusing and signal interaction, signalling energetics, behavioral
              and neural mechanisms of  sound recognition and localization, heritability and
              sexual selection.  This symposium should  build several new bridges between
              researchers studying these separate zoological taxa and  lead to future
              research efforts that synthesize and build upon the work of all investigators
              of  animal sound communication.
