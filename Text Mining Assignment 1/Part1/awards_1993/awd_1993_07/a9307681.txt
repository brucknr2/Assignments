Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Forest degradation is one of the most serious environmental                    
              problems afflicting Honduras and much of Latin America.                        
              Despite considerable deforestation in one region of Honduras                   
              local Lenca Indians have apparently managed their communal                     
              forests well.  A new agrarian law and a recently created a                     
              national park in the area that will influence the future of                    
              these woodlands.  These events appear related to a                             
              resurgence in Lenca ethnic identity and community members'                     
              efforts to gain title to their communal forests by                             
              organizing politically.  This project will investigate how                     
              communal forests are being managed and how a resurgence in                     
              ethnic identity help the Lenca to maintain communal forest                     
              lands. The research will focus on co-heads of households,                      
              community leaders, grassroots organization members,                            
              government officials, and development professionals.  The                      
              resulting doctoral dissertation will increase our knowledge                    
              of communal forest management and the social, ethnic, and                      
              political processes which can reduce the degradation of                        
              forest ecosystems.  The research findings will also assist                     
              in planning policy to promote sustainable management of                        
              forests in Honduras and other Latin American nations.
