Abstract    :
              9307909  Klinzing    An advanced control system to optimize the operation of
              pneumatic  conveying equipment will be investigated, using as input the 
              pressure fluctuations which is naturally induced by two-phase  solids-gas flow
              in pipes.  The flow pattern to be optimized  determines the energy consumption,
              the operation life of the  equipment, and the stability in operation.  Computer
              control, fuzzy  logic analysis and neural network techniques will be developed
              and  applied, in order  to obtain a stable and economical flow pattern  in
              operation.  The recommended control techniques will be  transmitted to
              industrial partners, who will form an "industrial  advisory board" to review
              the research progress and its transfer to  industry.    The proposed research
              may have important results for increasing the  efficiency and reliability of
              pneumatic transport in chemical  manufacturing, mining sites, pharmaceutical
              and food industry.   This is a university-industry collaborative research
              project, as  defined in the NSF Announcement GOALI (Grant Opportunities for 
              Academic Liaison with Industry, NSF 93-149).  ***
