Abstract    :
              9307132 Mayden          This research involves a detailed phylogenetic study of
              North American cyprinid fishes using a combination of morphological features
              and nucleotide sequences of mitochondria ribosomal genes.  This phylogeny will
              be used to establish a stable classification of these fishes and to examine
              patterns of morphological, ecological, and behavioral diversity within this
              important group of fishes. %%% Cyprinid fishes form a major component of
              aquatic ecosystems in North America, representing nearly 30% of the fish fauna.
               Therefore, it is important to understand the biological diversity of this
              group.  A more reliable understanding of the relationships of these fishes will
              contribute greatly to our understanding of the biogeography, ecology, and
              behavior of this important group of fishes.  In addition, this research will
              help identify unique populations and species, a requisite for any management
              scheme directed toward the conservation of aquatic ecosystems in North America.
