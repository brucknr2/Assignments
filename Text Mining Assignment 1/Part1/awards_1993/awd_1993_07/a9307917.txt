Abstract    :
              9307917  Carver  Concurrent software systems will be specified using an object- 
              oriented formal specification language.  The long-term objective  of the
              research is to define a hierarchy of formal specification  languages that
              address, in increasing specificity, the  requirements of concurrent systems. 
              This family of languages is  based on the concept of a base language that
              serves as the parent  class and subclasses that represent increasingly specify
              features  of concurrent systems.  The preliminary approach is to first  develop
              a hierarchical description of the classes and their  relationships and then to
              formally define the base class, both  syntactically and semantically.  Using
              inheritance, subclasses  will then be defined for categories of programming
              languages that  support specific language features.  This approach to the 
              specification of concurrent object-oriented systems promotes the  use of
              abstraction and assists the specifier with the  transformation of a problem to
              a language-specific form.  The  hierarchy of specifications also has potential
              for specification  reuse.    The planning activities include comprehensive
              study of research  in  areas that are fundamental to the proposed research, 
              including formal specification languages, concurrent object-  oriented
              languages, and algebraic specifications.  The planning  activities also include
              the development of a mini-language to  provide a mechanism for experimentation
              and for expansion of the  proposed research.  ***
