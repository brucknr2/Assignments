Abstract    :
                            9307348  Thomashow  Plants have evolved mechanisms that enable
              them to acclimate to,  and survive, a variety of environmental stresses. 
              Understanding  how these mechanisms operate is fundamental to our knowledge of 
              biological adaptation and may suggest novel approaches to improve  the
              environmental stress tolerance of important crop and  horticultural plant
              species.  The primary interest of this award is  in understanding the molecular
              basis of cold acclimation, the  process whereby plants increase in freezing
              tolerance in response  to low nonfreezing temperatures.  Most of our work is
              with the  small flowering plant Arabidopsis.  It has been shown that 
              Arabidopsis is capable of cold acclimating and that changes in gene  expression
              occur during the cold acclimation process.  A major goal  now is to determine
              whether the cor (cold-regulated) genes have  critical roles in freezing
              tolerance or some other aspect of low  temperature survival.  To address these
              issues, Dr. Thomashow and  his colleagues have isolated cDNA and/or genomic
              clones for five  Arabidopsis cor genes.  The initial characterization suggests
              that  certain of these genes may encode cryoprotective polypeptides.   Many of
              the proposed experiments are directed at testing this  hypothesis.  In
              addition, experiments are proposed that will  increase our knowledge of the
              magnitude and nature of the changes  in gene expression that occur during cold
              acclimation.  Taken  together, these studies should not only add to our
              understanding of  how plants acclimate to low temperature, but may also result
              in the  identification of genes that can be used to manipulate the freezing 
              and/or chilling tolerance of plants.  ***
