Abstract    :
              9307591 May The results of the proposed work will have benefits to basic and
              applied research.  The benefits to basic research are that these data will
              contribute to our understanding of the evolution of mating genes. 
              Basidiomycetes mushrooms have mating genes like Coprinus cinereus and
              constitute a major part of the world's flora.  In addition, similar
              evolutionary pressures are thought to affect plant mating genes.  The system I
              have chosen is an extreme example of molecules that must simultaneously
              conserve functions function and expand diversity.  Consequently, by
              understanding the evolution of this mating gene, I will obtain results bearing
              on a central problem in biology today; how do new gene functions evolve? %%%
              Potential benefits to applied research are apparent.  C.cinereus is
              representative of a large class of fungi, many of which are economically
              important.  To name a few, Ustilago maydis, a pathogen of corn and
              Phanerochaete chrysosporium, a fungus currently used for biopulping of wood
              products, are both Basidiomycetes fungi.  Their mating systems are much like
              that found in C. cinereus.  As humans need to manage and control these and
              other fungi, they need to know how the organisms move from one location to
              another and how fast they evolve.  Mating genes, because of their incredible
              variability provide very good genetic markers for migration.  Because of their
              inherent role in the evolution of such organisms, studying their ev olution
              will be important to understanding organismal evolution.
