Abstract    :
                   Professor Christodoulou will study the global dynamics of                 
              a new model of gravitational collapse in order to model the                    
              hydrodynamics of supernovae.  He will also study the global                    
              stability of rotating black holes to nonlinear gravitational                   
              perturbations.  This will help to understand the final stages                  
              of coalescence of a black hole binary.                                         
                   Professor Christodoulou's efforts are unusual, and highly                 
              valued and important.  They provide rigorous mathematical                      
              analysis to model problems which represent important aspects                   
              of gravitational theory.
