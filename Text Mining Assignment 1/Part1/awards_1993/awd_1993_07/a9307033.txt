                  9307033 McPeek          This research addresses why species differ in their
              responses to dramatic environmental changes by studying a group of aquatic
              insects, the Coenagrionidae damselflies (Odonata: Zygoptera) in two genera. 
              Some Enallagma species are found as larvae only in ponds and lakes containing
              fish, while the remaining Enallagma species are found as larvae only in
              fishless ponds and lakes.  In contrast, Ischnura species are abundant in both
              lake types.  The objectives of this research are to quantify the mechanisms and
              relative strengths of direct and indirect interactions among damselflies, their
              predators, and their prey in each lake type and to compare these results for
              the two communities.            many current theories explore the consequences
              of dramatic ecological changes to community structure by assuming that all
              species at a given trophic level respond similarly.  However, comparisons of
              natural communities show while some species are extirpated and replaced as
              community structure is changed, other species can persist over wide ranges of
              ecological conditions. %%% The study will have important ramifications for
              conserving biodiversity, by identifying key properties of species indication
              their sensitivity to dramatic ecological changes (e.g, comparable to those
              accompanying habitat alterations and climate change).
