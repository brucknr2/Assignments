Abstract    :
              Human colonization of the Americas has been an important and                   
              controversial issue. This is particularly true with regard to the              
              Clovis expansion shortly before 11,000 years ago. New dates                    
              suggest that one large mammal, the moose, followed the same route              
              as humans from Siberia into Alaska. Since human bones have never               
              been found in either region from this time period, the presence                
              of large numbers of moose bones offers an opportunity to analyze               
              the timing and ecological limits of these co-travellers. Sixty                 
              radiocarbon dates from northeastern Siberia, Alaska and the Yukon              
              will provide an indirect indicator of the extent of the woodland               
              environments and human/moose co-expansion into the New World.
