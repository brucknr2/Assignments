Abstract    :
              9307734  Plummer       The project is for the acquisition of a
              variable-temperature  scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy system that
              will operate  in the range of 25K->~1500K.  The essential component of this 
              package will be the JEOL JSTM-4500VT Scanning Tunneling Microscope.   This
              commercial STM has demonstrated atomic resolution from room  temperature up to
              1475K.  Also, JEOL is in the process of  engineering a low-temperature sample
              stage, compatible with JSTM-  4500VT, and capable of allowing atomic resolution
              imaging on  samples as low as 25K.  The participants in this proposal will be 
              working with JEOL to explore the capabilities of the low-  temperature stage.  
                  A broad range of materials problems will be investigated with  the
              variable-temperature STM, utilizing its ability to do atomic  scale microscopy
              and spectroscopy.  The interplay between atomic  and electronic structure in
              thin film nommetal-to-metal transitions  will be studied.  The detailed nature
              of Mott, Wilson, and Peierls-  like transitions can be probed in atomic detail
              as a function of  adsorbate density and substrate temperature.  The low
              temperature  STM will be used to monitor growth conditions for pulsed-laser 
              ablation epitaxial growth of high Tc superconducting films, to  directly
              measure the modulation of superconducting properties at  isolated growth steps,
              and to identify flux pinning sites  associated with surface morphology; to
              investigate the interaction  of hydrogen with simple, noble, and carbon
              surfaces and thin films,  concentrating on temperature-dependent changes in the
              structure and  bonding; and to investigate the physical and chemical properties
              of  alloy surfaces at elevated temperatures, combining the short-range 
              real-space capabilities of the STM with the long-range-order  capabilities of
              x-ray scattering.  Finally, experiments will be  aimed at nanofabrication,
              where selected organometallic complexes  will be physisorbed and subsequently
              decomposed by the electron  impact from the t unneling current to form "metal
              wires".  ***
