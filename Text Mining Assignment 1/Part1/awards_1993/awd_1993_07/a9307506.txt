Abstract    :
              9307506  Suzuki  This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The 
              research is a theoretical investigation on the fundamentals of  distributed
              robot control, to help identify those problems for  which the distributed
              approach is effective.  The theory and  techniques should also be useful in
              future development of  algorithms whose performance is mathematically
              predictable.  The  main feature of the method is to let each robot execute a
              simple  algorithm and determine its movement adaptively based on the given 
              goal and the observed movement of other robots.  This work is a  step toward
              the ultimate goal of determining exactly what classes  of problems are solvable
              by the distributed approach.  The Office  of Navel Research is expected to
              provide funds separately for this  project, starting in Fiscal Year 1994, at
              approximately the level  of the NSF award.
