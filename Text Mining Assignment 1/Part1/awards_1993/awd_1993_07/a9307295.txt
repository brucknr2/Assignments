Abstract    :
              Lilley  9307295             This project involves a time-series study of the
              hydrothermal and  magmatic activities on EPR. The 1989 ARG0 survey
              (Haymon/Fornari)  revealed an active hydrothermal field on EPR axis between
              9016' and  9054' N  "Tube Worm BBQ area" . AdVenture I "Alvin  diving on the
              Venture Hydrothermal Fields"  in April 1991 and  AdVenture II in Feb/Mar'92
              noted that eruptions are rapid  one  eruption took place within two weeks
              (dated in by 210Po/210Pb  diseq.-Rubin) prior to AdVenture II  and hydrothermal
              vents are  irregularly distributed. The P.I.s surmised that this system has 
              not yet reached steady-state.  They propose to go back to this area  with Alvin
              in an effort to monitor the evolution of the  volcanic-hydrothermal system. The
              work will include CCD imaging,  CTD measurements of water column and plume,
              biological activity  monitoring, volcanic rock sampling,on EPR axis between
              9016' and  9054' N. Scientific Justification---The P.I.s feel that by        
              documenting the changes in volcanic and hydrothermal activities  they will be
              able to obtain broad constraints over the period  during which the system goes
              steady-state, and mesurement of fluxes  during-steady state would give a better
              handle on the hydrothermal  input into the chemical composition of sea-water.
              They will also  know more about how these systems evolve through time.
