Abstract    :
              9307182  Zhang  A study of optical nonlinearities of an unusual class of
              nonlinear  organic crystals is proposed.  The principal investigator proposes 
              to use this crystal for optoelectronic characterization of high-  speed
              integrated circuits.  This nonlinear organic crystal, which  is synthesized at
              GE and recrystallized at Rensselaer, shows  extremely high nonlinearity.  These
              organic crystals emit the most  intense optically induced terahertz radiated
              field among all of the  natural non-externally biased materials we know.  A
              plan to measure  the second order nonlinear susceptibility of these organic
              crystals  by using a newly developed ultrafast optoelectronic technique is 
              proposed.  The ratio of independent nonvanishing susceptibility  tensor
              elements by analyzing the phase and the amplitude of  subpicosecond optical
              rectification radiation from these crystals  will be identified.  The physics
              origin of THz persistent  oscillation in their optical rectification after
              femtosecond  optical excitation will be explored.  This organic crystal will be
               integrated into an electro-optic sampling system for noncontact  ejection and
              detection of terahertz bandwidth electromagnetic  signals in ultrahigh speed
              integrated circuits.  The proposed work  is expected to have a substantial
              impact on the physical  understanding of these nonlinear organic crystals and
              is also  expected to provide important applications which will ensue for the 
              optoelectronic characterization of these crystals.  ***
