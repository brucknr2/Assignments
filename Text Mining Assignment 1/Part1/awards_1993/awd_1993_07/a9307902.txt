Abstract    :
                   The investigator proposes studying questions concerning                   
              superrigidity of lattices in semi-simple Lie groups using                      
              techniques of harmonic maps.  Further work is intended on non-                 
              abelian Hodge theory to quasiprojective varieties and cohomology               
              of foliations.
