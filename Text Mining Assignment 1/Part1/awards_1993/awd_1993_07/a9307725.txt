Abstract    :
              9214852  Glicksman     Experimental and theoretical studies are conducted on the
              geometric  evolution and kinetics of microstructures in two-phase binary 
              alloys.  The two main thrusts of the research are: (1) creation of  a suitable
              data statistical framework for describing the average  geometrical trajectories
              of complex 3-dimensional microstructures  evolving from their initial phase
              transformation states toward  thermodynamic equilibrium; and (2) companion
              experiments which  provide precision stereological data to quantify observed 
              microstructural changes occurring under well defined conditions of 
              composition, temperature, phase fraction, etc.  The microstructural 
              trajectories are themselves described quantitatively on a geometric  phase
              plane".  Experiments include isochronal annealing studies,  both with and
              without an applied magnetic field to eliminate  microconvection in solid-liquid
              alloys, then analyzed  stereologically with a new image processing tool.  %%% 
              This study should add fundamental understanding of how complex, 
              technologically important systems evolve geometrically and  kinetically during
              processing and approach thermodynamic  equilibrium.  ***
