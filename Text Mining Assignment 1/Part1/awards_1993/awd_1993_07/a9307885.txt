Abstract    :
              9307885 Hawkins This project will develop codified design recommendation for
              PRESSS consistent with the format of the NEHRP Recommended Provisions for the
              Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings.  For that activity input
              and feedback on the proposed recommendations will be solicited from PRESSS
              researchers, and from appropriate Building Seismic Safety Council Committees,
              American Concrete Institute Committees, Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute
              Committees and Structural Engineers Association Committee.  In addition to
              developing codified design recommendations, documentation will be provided
              concerning the development of those recommendations from specific archival
              sources of information.  Also, pictorial representations will be developed of
              connections and connection region details that meet the requirements of the
              recommendations and trial designs will be made for representative buildings to
              assess the economic and practical significance of the application of those
              recommendations.  A guide will be issued that contains details of those designs
              and the finding from them. ***
