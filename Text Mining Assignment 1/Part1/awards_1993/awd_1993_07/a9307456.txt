Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides funds for partial support of the "First                    
              International Forum of Particle Technology" and a preliminary                  
              workshop.  The aim of the workshop and conference is to bring                  
              together researchers in many different specific focused topic                  
              areas related to powder handling in order to promote the                       
              emergence of particle technology as a coherent field in the                    
              United States.  Coordinated efforts in Europe and the Pacific                  
              Rim are far more advanced with a number of visible academic                    
              departments and research institutes.  These meetings will help                 
                                                                                             
              to stimulate similar domestic efforts or to formulate some                     
              appropriate response in order to match developments in the                     
              field.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Powder technology significantly influences many industrial                     
              sectors including chemical, agricultural, food products,                       
              pharmaceuticals, mineral processing, advanced materials, air                   
              contamination and even mass communication.  As such,                           
              technological advances in the handling of powders have broad                   
              implications for the American economy and quality of life.
