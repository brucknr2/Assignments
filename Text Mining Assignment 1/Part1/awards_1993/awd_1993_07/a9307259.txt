Abstract    :
                  9307259  Kummel      This research addresses precise etching of GaAs(100)
              and Si(100)  by an exact integral number of monolayers using saturation dosing 
              of Cl2 followed by laser induced desorption.  Molecular chlorine  is required
              because it only absorbs to a coverage of one  monolayer on these two surfaces.
              The critical qualities for the  laser induced thermal desorption are (a)
              uniformity across the  sample; (b) complete removal of all etching products;
              (c)  restoration of the surface to a clean well-ordered state.  These 
              characteristics will be sought through the use of sequences of  nanosecond
              laser pulses or single microsecond laser pulses rather  than the conventional
              nanosecond single pulse technique. The  monolayer peeling technique is critical
              to the development of  quantum well devices because, if successful, it would
              allow  etching to the exact interface between two thin semiconductor  layers
              such as GaAs and AlGaAs.  %%%  The goal of this study is to devise a method of
              etching GaAs(100)  and Si(100) at room temperature without surface damage and
              with  an ultra-precise atomic level control over etch depth. This  proposed
              technique of monolayer peeling is cyclic etching with  chlorine and laser
              induced thermal desorption. The monolayer  peeling technique is critical to the
              development of advanced  electronic and photonic devices and integrated
              circuits using  structures such as compound semiconductor quantum wells,
              because  it would provide the basis for a critical fabrication process, 
              etching to the exact interface between two ultra-thin  semiconductor layers
              such as GaAs and AlGaAs.
