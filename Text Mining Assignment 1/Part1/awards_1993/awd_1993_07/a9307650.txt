Abstract    :
              9307650  Palakal  This award will fund an interdisciplinary study focused on 
              furthering the understanding of the bat's echolocating  system.  It will
              combine neurophysiological, multi-  resolution signal processing and artificial
              neural network  approaches to determine a biologically plausible model of  the
              FM bat's auditory system.  The overall goal is to  identify the mechanisms
              underlying auditory perception.    This proposal was submitted to the
              Biosystems Analysis and  Control Initiative which encouraged the submission of 
              proposals that through the study of neurophysiological  systems could advance
              engineering science and advance the  knowledge of biological systems through
              the use of  engineering analysis techniques.  The research being funded  by
              this award has the potential to advance both  neurophysiological sciences and
              the field of engineering  through its biological, signal processing and
              modeling  approaches.  ***
