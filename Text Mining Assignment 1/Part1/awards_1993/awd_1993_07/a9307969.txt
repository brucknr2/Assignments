Abstract    :
              9307969  Hylander    Both Experimental research and theoretical biomechanics
              have contributed to current understanding of mandibular function.  What remains
              unkown, however, is how well theoretical models correspond to actual mechanical
              behavior of the mandible.  Through experimental observations, this project will
              provide an empirical foundation from which to evaluate the accuracy of
              theoretical biomechanical models of the mandible, and to establish data base
              from which more realistic theoretical models can be developed. The results will
              be  important not   only to understanding the forces impinging on the human
              mandible, but to differing forces among primate species.  ***  cknowledgment of
