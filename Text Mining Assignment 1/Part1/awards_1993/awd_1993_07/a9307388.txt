Abstract    :
              9307388  Yamamoto    The glucocorticoid receptor is an intracellular factor that
              binds  to a specific class of circulating hormonal steroids; this 
              hormone-receptor interaction triggers binding of the receptor to  specific
              stress on DNA and a subsequent change in the expression  of nearby genes. 
              Recent evidence suggests that in addition to  the hormone, certain other
              factors also interact with the  receptor and modify its activity; these include
              a heat shock  protein, phosphate addicts, and DNA itself.  Dr. Yamamoto 
              proposes that these other interacting species may also convey  signaling
              information to the receptor, and that the receptor  consequently serves to
              integrate signals from different  regulatory input pathways.  He will
              investigate the nature and  consequences of these various receptor-ligand
              interactions, using  a range of molecular, genetic, biochemical and structural 
              approaches.  As signal transduction processes are universal and  fundamental
              for communication within and between cells, a better  understanding of the
              glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway,  and of the mechanisms by which
              multiple signaling inputs may  converge on a single factor, could be generally
              significant for  analyses of many transactions of biological information.  ***
