Abstract    :
              9307880 Pessiki The objectives of the project are:  (l) to develop analytical
              models for the hysteretic behavior of precast frames; (2) to develop analytical
              models for the hysteretic behavior of precast walls;  (3)  to perform system
              response evaluation studies of precast structures for different seismic zones
              with different site characteristics;  (4)  to develop preliminary design
              recommendations for precast seismic structural systems.  To achieve these
              objectives, the proposed project will design and analyze a set of prototype
              structures for ground motions representatives of various seismic zones and site
              characteristics in the U.S.  The prototype buildings will be frame and frame
              wall structures that utilize ductile connection construction.  The project will
              assess the seismic response of the prototype structures and based on this study
              preliminary design recommendations will be made. ***
