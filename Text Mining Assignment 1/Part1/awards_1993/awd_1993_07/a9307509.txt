Abstract    :
              Reactions of muonic hydrogen with hydrogen, deuterium, and                     
              tritium will be studied as a function of energy at the TRIUMF                  
              laboratory.  These reactions are of relevance to muon catalyzed                
              fusion.  This experiment will isolate, for the first time, the                 
              formation of muonic molecules from the more complex processes                  
              present in the full fusion cycle.  Cross sections and reaction                 
              rates will be obtained using Monte Carlo techniques, with                      
              specific responsibilities for developing the Monte Carlo computer              
              codes resting with the present Gustavus Adolphus group.
