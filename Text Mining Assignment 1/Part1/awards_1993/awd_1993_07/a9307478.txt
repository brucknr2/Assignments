Abstract    :
                   A number of problems in high energy atomic physics                        
              involving the interaction of photons and electrons with atoms                  
              are to be investigated.  The purpose is to quantitatively                      
              understand the role of relativistic and retardation effects in                 
              a regime where they are comparable or larger than those of                     
              electron correlations.  Many processes will be examined,                       
              including photoionization, Compton scattering, triply                          
              differential cross sections for photon and electron ionization                 
              processes and Delbruck scattering.  The training of students,                  
              postdoctorals and the significant international collaborations                 
              are integral to the project.  Results have applications to                     
              astrophysics, plasma physics and materials studies.
