Abstract    :
                   This award provides 64% of the funds needed to acquire                    
              equipment for a fluid dynamics laboratory system that will be                  
              installed, operated and maintained in the Department of Geology at             
              the Graduate School of Oceanography of Rhode Island University. The            
              institution is committed to providing the remaining funds required             
              for this equipment purchase.                                                   
                   The development of plate tectonics, coupled with advances in              
              understanding of seafloor geological processes and the geochemistry            
              and geophysics of the underlying mantle, has led to the view that              
              the solid earth is a system in active circulation. The equipment               
              to be installed in the fluid dynamics lab will be used, in                     
              conjunction with theory, to test various models of crust and mantle            
              dynamic flow.
