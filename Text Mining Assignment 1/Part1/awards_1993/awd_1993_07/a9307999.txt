Abstract    :
              9307999  Sinervo       An increase of energy invested in current reproduction is
               thought to entail :costs" that are either reflected in a decrease  in survival
              or a decrease in future reproductive success.  We have  devised an experimental
              test of these ideas in a natural population  of lizards.  By experimentally
              enhancing the number of eggs in a  clutch using a hormonal treatment, we should
              exacerbate those costs  and decrease survival or future reproductive success. 
              A  complementary manipulation that decreases the number of eggs laid  in each
              clutch should ameliorate these costs and enhance survival  or future
              reproductive success.  Because the hormones that control  reproduction are
              relatively conserved among vertebrates (e.g.,  reptiles, mammals, birds, fish),
              our results are likely to be quite  general.  Consequently, these results will
              be relevant to domestic  animal husbandry (e.g. aquaculture, bird rearing,
              etc.) and these  results could theoretically be used to maximize yield in such 
              agricultural programs.***
