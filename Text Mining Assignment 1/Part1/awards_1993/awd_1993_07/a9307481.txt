Abstract    :
                   The objective of the researched work is to develop compact,               
              efficient equipment capable of generating ozone at very high                   
              concentrations for the semiconductor manufacturing and materials               
              processing industry.  Emerging process technologies using ozone                
              chemistry have created the need for such equipment.  A novel                   
              experimental generator, constructed in phase I, has produced high              
              concentration ozone at three times the yield (efficiency) of                   
              conventional generators.  Full scale generators incorporating this             
              novel design are expected to be one-forth the size of conventional             
              generators.  The four goals for the phase II research are                      
              construction of a new laboratory scale generator which incorporates            
              the design improvements suggested by the phase I research                      
              utilization of the laboratory scale generator to explore several               
              promising approaches to obtaining additional yield improvements,               
              design and construction of a commercial scale generator, added                 
              design of modular ozone generation systems with a nominal                      
              production capacity of 2 to 8 kgm/day at 10 to 15 percent                      
              concentration.                                                                 
                   If successful, this research will lead to the development of              
              a critical manufacturing resource for use in the fabrication of the            
              next generation of semiconductor devices.
