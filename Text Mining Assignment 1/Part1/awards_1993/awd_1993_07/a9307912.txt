Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Robert Sokal   SBR-9307912    There are currently two
              contending hypotheses for the origin of the Indo-European speakers.  Colin
              Renfrew has challenged the established view, propounded by Marija Gimbutas,
              that the Indo-Europeanization of Europe proceeded in three waves between 4400
              and 2800 B.C. from trhe Pontic steppes, north of the Black Sea.  Renfrew has
              the Indo-europeans arising in Anatolia much earlier (7000 B.C.) and entering
              Europe as early agriculturalists, distributing themselves through Europe with
              the spread of the Neolithic.  Both of these hypotheses should have very
              different consequences for the subsequent population relationships among
              European groups.    Robert Sokal has constructed a unique database on European
              ethnohistory, recording the location and movements of most known ethnic units
              from 2200 B.C. to the present.  In the current pilot project, he will test the
              counts of movements in and out of different locales in Europe against genetic
              diversities in these areas, and test migration matrices against genetic
              distances.  These and other tests will determine the degree of robusticity of
              the database, given the likelihood that there are some omissions or
              exaggerations in the database.  This series of tests will establish the utility
              of the database in further predictions of  patterns of genetic variation over
              the European continent.    ***  P\anthro\jfried\9307912.abs    penses incurred
