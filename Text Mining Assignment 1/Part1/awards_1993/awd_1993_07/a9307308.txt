Abstract    :
              9307308  Hebert    This  research  examines  the mechanism  of  surface  pitting
               in  aluminum  alloys.  Surface impurity concentration  is  varied  by 
              annealing and surface dissolution treatments to asses the  effect  on  pit 
              density. Surface impurity and defect concentrations  are  monitored   through 
              surface  analytical  techniques,   including  Rutherford  Backscattering 
              Spectroscopy,  Secondary   Ion   Mass  Spectroscopy,    and    positron   
              annihilation    measurements.  Relationships between the importance of
              candidate defects  (e.g.,  vacancy/impurity  clusters, dislocations, surface 
              roughness)  as  corrosion  sites are sought.  Early stages of pit initiation 
              are  examined  through the interaction of chloride ions with  aluminum  oxide 
              films.   The positron measurements are carried  out  as  a  function  of
              temperature in order to provide defect migration  or  bonding energies so that
              the atomic structure of the defects  can  be  characterized.   These
              measurements  are  performed  on  high  purity  aluminum  doped with impurity
              elements to  determine  how  various impurities behave as corrosion sites.  %%%
               Practical information should result from this research that  will  assist in
              controlling corrosion of aluminum and its alloys.  ***
