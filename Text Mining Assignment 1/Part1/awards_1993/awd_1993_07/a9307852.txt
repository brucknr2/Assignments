Abstract    :
              9307852  Cohen    The aim of this research is to understand epitaxial crystal 
              growth of thin films at the atomic level, and to develop new and  more perfect
              thin film materials and structures.  The effort will  focus on understanding
              the fundamental processes of epitaxial  growth and on developing new,
              controlled approaches to epitaxy.  Several complementary growth monitors will
              be utilized in the  studies; reflection high energy electron diffraction and 
              reflection mass spectroscopy will be applied during  growth to monitor the
              structural and chemical evolution of  surfaces during molecular beam epitaxy. 
              Scanning tunneling  microscopy will be applied during growth interruptions to 
              eliminate ambiguity in the interpretation of diffraction  measurements. 
              Initial work will focus on the role of impurities  in the pinning and
              disordering of steps, on the structure of III-  V semiconductor surfaces, and
              on mechanisms for strain  relaxation.  The research will also be extended to
              the  growth of iron nitride, a new magnetic material.  %%%  The fundamental
              research conducted on epitaxial crystal growth is  expected to improve the
              technology of the primary materials that  are used in microelectronics and
              micromagnetics.  Techniques to monitor the fabrication of a thin film that are 
              sensitive enough to monitor each atomic layer as it is added to  the film will
              be developed and used to control the fabrication  process so that new and more
              perfect structures can be created.  ***
