Abstract    :
              9307190  Amy  This is an award to provide support for research to develop a 
              comprehensive model that describes the competitive sorption of  polycyclic
              aromatic hydrocarbons in water by minerals bound and  naturally present organic
              matter.  The investigators plan on  relating the transport of hydrophobic
              organic compounds like  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to factors that
              facilitate or  retard them by sorption on materials through which the water 
              flows.  The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to be studied span  the solubility
              range from naphthalene to benzo(alpha)anthracene.  The natural organic matter
              will include standard reference humic  substances as well as that in natural
              soils.  Minerals used will  include quartz, goethite, calcite, kaolinite and
              montmorillonite  alone and in various combinations typical of aquifers.    The
              result of this project is expected to be a mathematical model  that describes
              transport characteristics of polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons in groundwater
              when subjected to contact with  naturally present organic matter and aquifer
              minerals.  Its  potential use will be in the design and operation of processes 
              and systems for remediation of groundwater and soil that has been  contaminated
              with hydrocarbons.
