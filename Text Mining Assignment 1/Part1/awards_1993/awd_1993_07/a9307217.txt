Abstract    :
              9307217     Matyjaszewski    The aim of this research project is to continue
              synthesis and basic  characterization of polysilanes with functional groups,
              based on  the dearylation reaction discovered for oligosilanes in our 
              laboratories.  This technique was extended to polysilanes with  phenyl groups
              to form partially triflated  poly(methylphenylsilylene).  The backbone with
              electrophilic sites  is used for the attachment of various functional groups as
              well as  to perform grafting.  In order to enhance stability of polysilanes 
              with side functional groups, a new technique based on the  connection of the
              electrophilic reactive site (alkyl triflate) via  a trimethylene spacer will be
              used.  This method will increase  stability of new polymers although it will
              limit electronic effects  due to the insulating character of the alkane chain
              separating  electronically active groups from the delocalized polysilane 
              backbone.  Additionally, ring-opening polymerization of strained 
              cyclotetrasilanes with functional groups will be explored.  This  method can
              provide control of configuration of substituents and  also affect electronic
              properties.  Thus, the project focuses on  preparation and characterization
              (NMR, GPC, viscometry, light  scattering, UV, fluorescence, DSC, TGA, X-ray,
              electron microscopy,  electron diffraction) of polysilanes with new functional
              groups as  well as corresponding block and graft copolymers.    Polysilanes are
              new advanced materials with interesting properties  which lead to applications
              in electronics, optics, and ceramics.   Additional applications are possible
              when materials with more  diversified structure will be available.  Nearly all
              known  polysilanes contain only alkyl and aryl substituents, but this  research
              aims to prepare new types of these materials.  ***
