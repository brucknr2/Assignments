Abstract    :
              9307832  Burggren         The cardiovascular system is the first organ system to
               operate in developing vertebrate embryos, and proper  establishment of its
              transport functions is absolutely critical  to the subsequent  normal
              development of all tissues and organs.  In spite of this important early role
              for the cardiovascular  system, the development  of its physiology remains 
              very poorly  understood for any vertebrate, including birds and mammals. Our 
              initial findings on anuran amphibians (frogs) have been highly  useful in
              advancing our understanding of studying the general  properties of embryonic
              circulations. Consequently, support has  been requested to expand our
              investigations of the development of  central arterial blood pressure and flow
              generation and its  regulation in embryos and larvae of the frog Xenopus
              laevis,  which has become one of the major vertebrate models in  development
              biology.       The major objectives of this proposal are to: 1) determine  the
              development of flow and pressure generation in the early  embryonic heart, and
              2) to determine how external and internal  influences that lead to low tissue
              oxygenation and changes in  blood transport demands affect both the short-term
              and long-term  performance of the cardiovascular  system in embryos and beyond 
              to the adult.       Measurement will include recordings of the heart rate heart
               output, blood pressure, peripheral resistance and heart work. The 
              experimental design will encompass rearing populations of  developing embryos
              under conditions that include short-term and  long-term exposure to low oxygen
              levels, and subsequently  assessing their physiological performance to
              determine when in  development they are most vulnerable environmental
              disturbance.       Our studies on physiological development and how 
              environmental conditions impact upon it will have very broad  applicability to
              both vertebrate physiology and developmental  biology, particularly in the
              almost complete absence of similar  published data on eit her bird or mammal
              embryos.  ***
