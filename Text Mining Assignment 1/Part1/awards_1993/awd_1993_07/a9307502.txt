Abstract    :
              9307502  Koenig    This research project aims to study the interplay between
              competition and cooperation in a  highly social species in which groups consist
              of closely related individuals.  Acorn  woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus)
              live in permanently territorial family groups of up to  12 individuals.  Each
              group has only a single nest at a time, and all group members aid in 
              incubation and the feeding of nestlings.  The primary goal of this project is
              to use modern  molecular techniques (DNA fingerprinting) to determine parentage
              within groups of different  composition.  The work continues study of a
              population consisting entirely of color-marked  birds followed since 1971 and
              will combine banding and behavioral observation of the  population with
              laboratory analyses.    The results will help to clarify why some animals live
              together, how kinship facilitates group  living, and the ways that competition
              is resolved in social species.  The results will  consequently be of interest
              to all those studying sociality and behavior, including  anthropologists and
              sociologists as well as behavioral biologists.
