Abstract    :
              9307407  Harrison       This award provides funding for the installation and
              testing  of a new prototype secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) 
              system recently acquired by the Department of Earth and Space  Sciences at the
              University of California, Los Angeles. The new SIMS  instrument is designed to
              optimize capabilities for isotopic  analyses of the uranium-lead system with
              spatial resolution on the  order of ten micrometers for the purpose of dating
              very old  geological events. After the period of installation and testing the 
              UCLA machine will be operated as a national facility available to  the U.S.
              geoscience research community.  ***
