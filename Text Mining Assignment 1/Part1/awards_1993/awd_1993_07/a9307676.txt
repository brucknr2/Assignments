Abstract    :
              9307676  Hadjipanayis  This project deals with the synthesis and
              characterization of  granular solids and exchange-coupled magnetic metal
              multilayers.   The magnetic properties will be correlated with the
              microstructure  and the magnetic domain structure observed by Lorentz
              microscopy.   The magnetic studies include field and temperature dependence of 
              coercivity, remanence curves, anisotropy measurements, and magnetic  after
              effects.  The magnetic properties of iron and cobalt granular  solids will be
              studied systematically by investigating the effects  of sample preparation,
              different matrix material, film  microstructure and particle interactions. 
              Similar Studies will be  made on iron/iron oxide and cobalt/coblat oxide films.
               The  research includes modeling studies of the micromagnetic behavior of  the
              materials.  %%%  This project will support research that will produce new types
              of  magnetic materials.  Some of the materials consist of small  magnetic
              particles.  Others are thin films of iron and cobalt and  ion and cobalt
              oxides.  The materials are of fundamental interest,  but are of great
              technological interest also in the area of  magnetic recording materials.  The
              complex materials properties of  the magnets will be characterized by a variety
              of techniques,  electron microscopy.  In addition, the properties of the
              materials  will be modeled as an aid in the interpretation of the observed 
              phenomena.  ***
