Abstract    :
              9307877  Singh          This proposed project utilizes the PI's prior
              experiences in  preparing ceramic matrix composites (CMC) of unique
              microstructures  and controlled interfacial properties with novel processing 
              techniques.  Crack growth studies will be performed within a  Scanning Electron
              Microscope (SEM) equipped with a mechanical  loading stage.  Fracture
              experiments will be done in a 3-point  flexure mode.  Fiber bridging stress
              will be measured by Laser  Raman Spectroscopy (LRS).  The mechanism of crack
              growth and in  situ measurements of the local stress-displacement relations
              will  be incorporated into an analytical model based on the cohesive  crack
              approach.  The objective of this study is to provide a  comprehensive but
              fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of  fracture and crack propagation
              in fiber reinforced ceramic matrix  composites (FRCMC).    %%%          This
              proposed project seeks to understand the fundamental  mechanisms of fracture
              and crack propagation in fiber reinforced  ceramic matrix composites (FRCMC). 
              It starts with uniquely  prepared CMC with controlled interfacial properties
              and  microstructures.  A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped  with a
              mechanical loading stage allows the study of its crack  growth behaviors in
              situ.  Testing with a 3-point flexure mode  provides information to practical
              applications.  finally, the fiber  bridging stress will be measured with the
              use of Laser Raman  spectroscopy.  This comprehensive project offers the useful
               information in the design of materials for specific applications.  ***
