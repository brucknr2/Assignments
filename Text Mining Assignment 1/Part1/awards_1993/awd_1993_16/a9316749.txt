Abstract    :
              9316749  Palm  A great deal of attention has been given to the development of 
              cross-national policy in earthquake hazard reduction-particularly  under the
              aegis of the International Decade for Natural Hazard  Reduction.  For example,
              California officials have investigated  some of the policies and practices in
              force in Japan-and the ways  in which these policies might be translated in the
              U.S. context.    Previous research shows a relationship between the ways the
              risks  are communicated and their salience to individuals.  Studies have  also
              analyzed the effects of public policy on individual  behavior. But are the
              relationships observed in U.S. studies  applicable in other cultures?  Indeed,
              have our own conclusions  possibly been biased and therefore impoverished as a
              result of  their mono-cultural empirical base.  Using survey methodology the 
              study has two specific goals: (1) to determine cross-cultural  similarities and
              differences in perception and understanding of  earthquake risk; and (2) to
              determine cross-cultural similarities  and differences in the adoption of
              mitigation measures, including  non-mandatory earthquake insurance.  ***
