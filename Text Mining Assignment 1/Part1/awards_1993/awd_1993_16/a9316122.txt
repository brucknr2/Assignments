Abstract    :
              9316122  Norris       PI will test rates and modes of speciation in planktic 
              foraminifera using stable isotopic and morphometric analyses.  He  will:  1)
              compare rates of morphological and ecological speciation  at sites distributed
              around the globe, 2) determine whether or not  ancestral species survive at low
              abundance following anagenetic  speciation events, 3) evaluate the relationship
              between speciation  and water column structure to understand nature and
              geographic  extent of oceanographic controls on diversification.
