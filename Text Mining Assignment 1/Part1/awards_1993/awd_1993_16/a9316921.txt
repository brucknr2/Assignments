Abstract    :
              9316921  Fuller      The PI will carry out measurements and analysis of natural
              remanence magnetism parameters for the sections of the various cores carrying
              the reversal records from ODP Leg 145, which demonstrate fluctuations in the
              magnetic intensity record within the Matuyama-Brunhes transition.  This will
              include the sections immediately prior to and following the reversal for
              distances corresponding to several thousand years.  Rock magnetic measurements
              such as hysteresis loops, low temperature inversions measurements, IRM
              acquisition, and Curie temperature determinations will be performed in order to
              determine the actual minerals and characterize the magnetic remanence.  These
              measurements will be supplemented by x-ray diffraction and microscopic studies
              of the material at various depths within the reversal zone.  The PI will also
              develop a model to simulate the preferred longitudinal bands for the
              transitional virtual geomagnetic poles that will initially take the form of a
              geometric simulation of flux bundles on the core surface.   ****
