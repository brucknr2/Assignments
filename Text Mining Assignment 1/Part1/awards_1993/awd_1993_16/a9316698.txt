Abstract    :
              9316698  Asquith      This award will support the travel expenses for Dr. Adam
              Asquith,  of the B. P. Bishop Museum Department of Entomology in Honolulu,  to
              enable him to make one visit each year over the next three  years, to conduct
              cooperative research with Dr. Gerasimos Cassis  of the Department of Entomology
              at the Australian Museum in  Sydney. The collaborative work will focus on the
              Miridae bugs  from the Indo-Pacific Region. The Miridae is the largest family 
              of Heteroptera, containing over a third of all described species  in this
              order.    The Miridae fauna of the east Indo-Pacific biogeographical area, 
              including Australia and Hawaii, remains largely unknown. This   research will
              initiate a systematic review of the tribe  Orthotylini for this region. The
              work will provide descriptions  and identification keys for the fauna,
              hypotheses of evolutionary  relationships, tests of existing biogeographic
              models of the  area, and propose new hypotheses for Pacific Island
              biogeography.  The collaborators will directly benefit by combining the 
              facilities and resources of the two largest systematic entomology  research
              collections in the Indo-Pacific, the Australian Museum  and the B. P. Bishop
              Museum. Support for Dr. Cassis to visit  Hawaii is provided through the
              Australian Department of Industry,  Technology and Regional Development.
