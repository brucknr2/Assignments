Abstract    :
              9316569  Nelson         Following the successful completion in the summer of
              1992 of  a pilot study (INDEPTH I) of deep seismic profiling in Tibet, the  
              next phase of the study (INDEPTH II) involves the acquisition and  analysis of
              some 200 km of deep seismic reflection profile,  together with complementary
              wide-angle and off-line (sparse 3-D)  reflection data, and surface geological
              information, along a  traverse extending across the northern Tethyan Himalaya,
              Indus-  Tsangpo suture zone, and Gangdese batholith in southern Tibet.  The 
              acquired data will provide new and possibly fundamental insight  into the
              mechanism by which continental crust is deformed and  thickened within the
              Himalaya/Tibet plateau collision zone-the type  example of active
              continent/continent collision on Earth.           The project will be
              undertaken collaboratively with the  Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources
              of China (MGMR) on the  principle of equal cost sharing, and will use an MGMR
              seismic  reflection crew for data acquisition and to provide the seismic 
              source for wide-angle and off-line recording.  On the U.S. side,  the  program
              will involve direct grants to Cornell and Syracuse  Universities for overall
              project coordination and data  acquisition/processing, and to Stanford
              University for wide-  angle/off-line recording.  Investigators from Columbia
              University  and the State University of New York at Albany will also be 
              involved in data interpretation, coordination with MGMR, and  acquisition of
              surface geological data along the transect.  ***
