Abstract    :
              9316711  Levander         This award provides 73 percent of the funds required
              for the  acquisition of a 60-channel digital 24-bit seismograph, cables, 
              geophones, and a seismic source to be used by the reflection  seismology
              research group in the Department of Geology and  Geophysics at Rice University.
              The University is committed to  providing the remaining funds necessary to
              acquire the equipment.       The Rice University program will utilize the
              seismograph  system in their current research projects which include land and 
              marine seismic experiments in the Blake Plateau, Carolina Trough,  Gulf of
              Mexico, the Hatton-Rockall Bank, central California  transform margin, Aleutian
              Arc, and the Brooks Range in Alaska.  These and other active projects are
              supported by the National  Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research
              and are aimed  at a better understanding of the structure of the Earth's crust
              and  of the methodology of seismic imaging techniques.  ***
