Abstract    :
              9316556  Mesarovic  This award addresses a need to develop effective policy
              analysis  tools to help decision makers, their staff, and the general public 
              absorb a plethora of scientific findings when assessing alternative  policies. 
              Decision support concept and technology is being  effectively used by industry
              when addressing complex issues  burdened by uncertainties.  Global change
              issues are within the  category of complex and uncertain problems.  Briefings
              will be  conducted in the Cleveland, Ohio area to help bridge the gap  between
              global change scientific research and the public domain  with regard to the
              assessment of alternative polices relating to  global issues.    ***
