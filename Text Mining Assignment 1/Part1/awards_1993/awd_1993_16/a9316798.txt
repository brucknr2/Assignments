Abstract    :
              9316798  Kraichnan       Under this award, the principal investigator will
              pursue three  related topics directed at fundamental understanding of turbulent
               cascade processes:  (1) a search for bounds on scaling exponents of  the
              inertial range of three-dimensional incompressible Navier-  Stokes turbulence; 
              (2) development of analytical methods for  predicting statistics of velocity
              differences across distances that  fall within the inertial range of scales; 
              (3) theoretical and  numerical study of the probability of extreme values of
              velocity,  vorticity, and other quantities of turbulent flow.  The first 
              project will make systematic use of exact multi-time dynamical  constraints and
              multi-time realizability inequalities on  statistics.  The second project will
              exploit nonlinear mapping  techniques in order to approximate probability
              distribution  functions and other high-order statistics of velocity differences
               across inertial-range distances.  The third project will use  nonlinear
              mapping techniques to estimate the magnitude and  sensitivity of extreme-value
              tails of probability distribution  functions for turbulence and other nonlinear
              processes.       This research will provide important insights for a variety of
               problems in atmospheric sciences including improvement of the  modeling of
              subgrid-scale processes.   ***
