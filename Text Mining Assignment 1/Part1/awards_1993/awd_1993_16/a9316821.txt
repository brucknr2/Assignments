Abstract    :
              9316821                   The focus of this research is the use diiron bridging
              acyl   complexes in organic synthesis. There are five specific aspects   of
              these diiron complexes that will be studied. The first is   the synthesis and
              resolution, if necessary, of optically pure   chiral complexes. Second is the
              investigation of reductive   cleavage of the metal from the inital products
              which will allow   the metal portion of the molecule to be recycled. Third is
              the   study of the utlity of the formation of thioesters from the   oxidation
              of the diiron acyl complex. Fourth is the examination   of these complexes as
              asymmetric Michael acceptors. Fifth is   the investigation of the chemistry of
              the decarbonylation   product.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic
              Program is supporting   the research of Dr. Scott R. Gilbertson of the
              Department of   Chemistry at Washington University. Professor Gilbertson will  
              focus his work in the area of synthetic methodology by studying   the use of
              diiron organometallic complexes to accomplish a   number of novel synthetic
              transformations.  ***
