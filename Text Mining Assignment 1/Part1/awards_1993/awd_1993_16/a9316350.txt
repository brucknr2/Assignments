Abstract    :
              9316350  Carr  The purpose of the proposed work is to discover new physical 
              constraints that will lead to a better understanding of arc  volcanoes.  We
              propose two projects.  The first is to  quantify the spatial distribution of
              arc volcanism, with  special emphasis on measuring the sizes of volcanoes.  The
               second project is to examine the morphologies of arc  volcanoes to determine
              if they can be related to chemical or  other physical parameters.  The
              significance of the proposed  work is that volcanism is the observable surface
              result of  the managing processes at convergent margins.  Highly  sophisticated
              geochemical models exist for arc volcanism and  several attempts have been made
              to link geochemical  parameters to tectonic and volcanological features.  We 
              propose to quantify volcano distribution and morphology,  focussing for the
              most part on Central America.  We will  then determine what correlations exist
              between the new  physical data and existing geochemical data and use the 
              results to try to eliminate some of the several competing  models of melt
              generation and migration.
