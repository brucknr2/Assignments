Abstract    :
              9316587  Ingersent  This proposal concerns the physics arising out of
              interactions  between magnetic impurities embedded in non-magnetic materials. 
              Specifically, the behavior of multi-band Kondo and Anderson models  are to be
              studied. Marginal-Fermi-liquid behavior (a suggestion for  the normal state of
              the high Tc materials) is observed for multi-  band Kondo and Anderson models,
              but recent numerical  renormalization-group calculations show that when
              interaction is  allowed between impurities, Fermi-liquid behavior is recovered.
              The  PI proposes to expand this work to more complex and/or realistic  models
              and to frustrated magnetic systems coupled to multiple  bands.  %%%  This work
              concerns elucidation of the behavior of models which have  been put forward to
              describe the electronic properties of materials  containing heavy magnetic
              elements such as the recently discovered  high temperature superconductors.
              Discussion here has revolved  around what is the appropriate zeroth order
              description of the  electronic states of such materials. Some of the putative
              models,  at their simplest give certain types of unusual behaviors but the  PI
              has shown that as these models are made more "realistic", then  behavior tends
              to revert to the more usual descriptions with which  traditional solid state
              physics is more familiar. The PI will  continue this work towards ever more
              realistic descriptions.  ***
