Abstract    :
              9316279  Cobabe       Bivalve shells are common fossils in near-shore marine
              strata  from the early Paleozoic to the Recent.  The diversity and  abundance
              of bivalves makes them an important research target for  molecular
              paleontology.  Based on our preliminary research, the  geologically stable and
              easily extracted class of compounds known  as lipids offers a promising new
              approach to interpreting the  biogeochemical record of bivalves.  Recent and
              fossil shells  contain a wide variety of mineral-associated lipids, including 
              fatty acids, cholesterol, ketones, phytadienes, and alkanes.  The  shell-lipid
              assemblages contain compounds that are 1) present in  all of the studied
              bivalves (recent and fossil), 2) specific to a  single taxon, and 3)
              environmentally specific.  In the cases of  extraordinary fossil preservation,
              lipids trapped in the shell may  provide a clean molecular and isotopic record
              of trophic strategy,  biosynthetic pathway, and paleoenvironmental conditions. 
              We  propose utilizing the molecular structure and 13C content of shell  lipids
              to determine the biogenic source of the compounds.  We will  then apply these
              compounds to studies of 1) chemosymbiosis in the  fossil record and 2) the use
              of fatty acid saturation to assess  paleotemperature.
