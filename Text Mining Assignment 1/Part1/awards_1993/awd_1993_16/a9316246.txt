Abstract    :
                    9316246  James    This research planning grant will support the collection
              of data and the development of  molecular techniques necessary to assess
              patterns of genetic variation in howler monkeys.  This will include studying 
              variation in mitochondrial DNA as well as single copy nuclear DNA and a
              variable number of tandem repeat loci from a number of black howler monkeys
              from 16 troops in Belize and 15 individuals from3 troops in Vera Cruz, Mexico. 
              Comparisons of all three molecular data sets will allow separate analyses of
              maternal and paternal inter-troop gene flow as well as within troop familial
              relationships.  With the inclusion of sequences from wooly and spider monkeys,
              a comprehensive phylogeny of the genus Alouatta and its relationship to other
              New World monkeys will be achieved.   ***
