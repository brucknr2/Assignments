Abstract    :
              9316221  Haeberli         The University of Wisconsin experimental nuclear
              physics group will carried out  research in the structure of few-nucleon
              systems (including the quark substructure),  meson production and meson
              exchange current processes, fundamental weak  interactions (tests of the
              standard model of electroweak interactions), and symmetry  tests.  An in-house
              tandem van de Graaff accelerator with polarized beam capability,  as well as
              polarized targets, will be used to carry out the in-house research program  and
              develop equipment needed for user mode experiments.  Precision measurement 
              techniques are central to the in-house few-nucleon studies.  User experiments
              will be  carried out at IUCF, Bates, NIKHEF, HERA, and Louvain la Neuve. 
              Polarized beam  and target techniques are central to all research activities. 
              Optical traps for polarized  radioactive atoms will be developed and used in
              some of the weak interaction  experiments.  Atomic beam and laser pumped
              polarized targets and related equipment  will be developed for the medium
              energy program, which is based at the IUCF Cooler  facility, and the electron
              accelerators at Bates, NIKHEF, and HERA.    ***
