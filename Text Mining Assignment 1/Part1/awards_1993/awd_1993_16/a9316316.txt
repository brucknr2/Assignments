Abstract    :
              9316316  Burnham       PI will investigate modern and fossil angiosperm climbers
               (lianas).  Objectives are to determine the diagnostic foliage  characteristics
              of climbing angiosperm families, to correlate basic  climatic, habitat, and
              forest structure characteristics with  climber diversity, abundance, and
              morphology, and to use these  features of systematics and ecology to
              characterize the forested  habitats of two distinct sites in the early Tertiary
              of western  North America (Paleocene Raton Formation, NM; Eocene Puget Group, 
              WA).  Studies of modern sites include field work in Central and  South America.
               Results will be important to studies of plant  community evolution, with
              implications for the impact of  deforestation and global climate change on
              vegetation.
