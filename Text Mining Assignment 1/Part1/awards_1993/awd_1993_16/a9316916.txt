Abstract    :
              9316916  Jacobson       The Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary aged Chocolate
              Mountains  thrust is part of a major, extensive fault zone in SE California 
              that places Precambrian to Mesozoic gneisses over Cretaceous high  pressure/low
              temperature schists.  The transport direction is  toward the NE and this has
              been used to help reconstruct a large  part of the SW Cordillera during
              Cretaceous times.  Recent work has  shown that several sections of this major
              fault zone, including the  Chocolate Mts. thrust, may have been reactivated and
              that they  therefore may represent exhumation rather than subduction and 
              burial tectonism.   This project will resolve the controversy by  detailed
              field work with structural and metamorphic petrology.  The  results will allow
              meaningful plate reconstructions for the  Mesozoic to Tertiary in the SW
              Cordillera, and will have  implications for similar tectonic settings in other
              major orogenic  belts.
