Abstract    :
              9316238  Knoll  PI and collaborators (including Guy Narbonne of Queens
              University  in Canada) will collect and analyze geochemically samples of 
              Neoproterozoic (c. 1000-545 Ma) rocks in northwestern Canada.   These analyses
              will refine and extend an increasing body of data  showing that significant
              temporal variations in isotopic  composition of seawater characterize this time
              period.  These  variations in carbon and strontium isotopes are important tools
              for  global correlations, and help to elucidate geologic and biological  events
              from this time.  ***
