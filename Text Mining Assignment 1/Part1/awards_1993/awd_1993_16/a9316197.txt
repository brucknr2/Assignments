Abstract    :
              9316197  Wendlandt  The proposed research involves experimental investigations 
              of alkali basalts, demonstrated by previous geochemical and  inverse-approach
              experimental studies to be parental to  voluminous, rift-associated, volcanic
              occurrences.  High  pressure and temperature forward-approach melting 
              experiments will be used to characterize the processes and  the physical and
              chemical conditions within the crust  necessary for the genesis of these lavas.
               Specific  experimental objectives are:  (1) to determine liquid lines  of
              descent (fractionation paths) for melts derived by  equilibrium partial melting
              or crystallization of alkali  basalt compositions for a range of mid-crustal to
              upper  mantle pressures and temperatures; (2) to determine the  compositions of
              mineral phases present at these pressure and  temperature conditions; (3) to
              characterize residual phase  assemblages (cumulate lithologies); and (4) to
              compare  compositions of phases from alkali basalt melting  experiments with
              those documented at liquidus conditions for  intermediate composition lavas. 
              The results of the proposed  experimental and analytical studies will provide a
              basis for  evaluating polybaric paths for melt evolution at crustal  conditions
              and enable development of integrated models for  continental models for
              continental rift structure and  evolution and for the involvement of crust in
              rifting  processes.
