Abstract    :
              9316803  Lee    Technical abstract:  Many materials that are barely on the 
              insulating side of a metal-insulator transition conduct electricity  by
              variable range hopping (VRH), for which the conductivity depends  on
              temperature as exp(T0/T)1/n, for integer n > 1.  While VRH by  non-interacting
              electrons is well understood, recent experiments  have shown that VRH at low
              temperatures in the presence of magnetic  perturbations leads to new and
              unexpected phenomena, including the  possibility of a new spin-charge coupled
              quasiparticle.  It is  planned to investigate the many-body density-of-states
              and  elementary excitation spectrum in VRH conductors using electron  tunneling
              and magneto transport experiments at low temperatures and  high magnetic
              fields.  The goal is to directly measure the proposed  energy gap structure
              inferred from conductivity data and to  elucidate the effects of magnetic
              scattering on hopping conduction.    Non-technical abstract:  A fundamental
              problem in condensed matter  physics is concerned with the mechanism of
              electrical conduction in  a solid.  While the understanding of common metals
              and  semiconductors is highly developed, many materials exhibit unusual,  often
              poorly understood electrical behavior.  A commonly observed  form of
              unconventional electrical conduction is known as variable-  range hopping
              (VRH).  Since many diverse technologically important  solids are VRH
              conductors, it is of practical importance to develop  a more profound physical
              understanding of this process.  Recent  experiments have shown that VRH
              conduction can yield complex and  completely unexpected behavior.  In order to
              elucidate the  fundamental principles which underlie this electrical conductiom
              it  is proposed to study directly rhe microscopic properties of the  charge
              carriers in different VRH conductors.  ***
