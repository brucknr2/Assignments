Abstract    :
              9316981  Aguilera  The goal of this research is to further characterize the 
              molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved in lymphocyte-  specific DNA
              recombination. We have isolated and partially  characterized a nuclease
              activity, Endo-S, which we believe  is intimately involved in the isotype
              switch recombination  process. We will continue to biochemically characterize 
              Endo-S, sequence the native protein derived from it and  generate a specific
              antisera to it. We will attempt to clone  the gene encoding Endo-S and express
              it. We will also  isolate and characterize any factors associated with it.  %%%
               It is thought that this endonuclease, Endo-S, is involved in  the DNA
              rearrangements which account for the large numbers  of different antibodies
              which can be made by mammals. There  is also suggestive evidence that it may
              also be involved in  somatic DNA rearrangements which could have less desirable
               consequences, such as DNA translocations associated with  oncogenes. A
              complete characterization of this protein could  lead to a better understanding
              of its functional role in  several different cellular processes.  ***
