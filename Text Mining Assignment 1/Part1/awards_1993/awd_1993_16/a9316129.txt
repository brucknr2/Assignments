Abstract    :
              9316129  Mathez  The large layered mafic complexes are important because they 
              contain evidence for fundamental processes in igneous  petrology and because
              several contain economic deposits of  various metals, including the platinum
              group elements  (PGEs).  The essential question addressed by this project is 
              what is the role of post-cumulus, magmatic processes, in  particular
              metasomatism, in the formation of  PGE-rich  horizons.  In order to investigate
              this question, two  related studies will be conducted.  The first involves a 
              detailed study of trace element contents of pyroxene and  other major phases of
              the Merensky reef and adjacent rocks  in the Atok area, northeast Bushveld
              Complex.  A second  study involves the PGE-rich horizon of the Great Dyke.  The
               horizon, which is known as the MSZ, exhibits a  characteristic geochemical
              stratigraphic profile whereby the  maximum concentrations of Ni, Cu, S and Au
              are found  approximately 15 to 30 cm higher in the stratigraphy than  the
              maximum concentrations of Pt, Pd and the other PGEs.  A  relationship will be
              sought between the profiles for the  chalcophile elements and incompatible
              element contents of  pyroxene, which again will be determined by ion probe. 
              Se/S, As/S and Te/S ratios may help to distinguish whether  the sulfides were
              concentrated by mainly cumulate or  metasomatic processes.
