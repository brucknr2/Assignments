Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9316163  Hernandez  This is a continuation
              of successful project at South Pole,  Antarctica, which uses a Fabry-Perot
              spectrometer to measure high  altitude (greater than 85 kilometers) winds and
              atmospheric  temperatures by measuring the Doppler shift and line widths of 
              several atmospheric emissions.  Measurements over the past several  years have
              led to the discovery that, because of the location of  the observatory at the
              geographical South Pole, waves of global  scale can be followed as they travel
              entirely around the Earth.   This feature has allowed the disentanglement of
              waves traveling in  opposite directions around the Earth.  These newly
              discovered waves  have periods ranging from a few hours to many days.  ***
