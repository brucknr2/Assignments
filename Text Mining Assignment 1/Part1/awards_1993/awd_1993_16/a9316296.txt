Abstract    :
              9316296   Backhus    Wetlands are a natural resource of paramount importance in
              that  they are highly productive and biodiverse, and provide shelter for  a
              number of endangered species.  This unique environment can also  be
              "engineered" to treat aquatic pollutants.  Synthetic organic  compounds (SOCs)
              from agricultural run-off, atmospheric deposition,  and other nonpoint sources
              threaten their ecology.  One aspect of  SOC fate and transport in a wetland
              ecosystem that is poorly  understood is the role of mobile organic colloids
              that can bind  many nonpopular organic substances and enhance some aqueous
              phase  concentrations well beyond equilibrium expectations.  The proposed 
              study of the effects of organic colloids on the speciation and  mobility of
              SOCs in wetland environments will (1) measure the in  situ distribution of SOCs
              between environmental compartments, (2)  determine the abundances and
              distribution of organic colloids in  wetlands, (3) characterize the
              physiochemical properties of organic  colloids, (4) determine the partition
              reactivity of wetland organic  colloids to SOCs, and (5) correlate the
              properties of organic  colloids with their propensity to react with SOCs. 
              Samples will be  collected from three sites in Ohio:  Old Woman's Creek, Cedar
              Bog,  and the proposed Olentangy River constructed wetlands in Columbus.  The
              proposed research will better our understanding of and improve  our ability to
              model the role of colloids in controlling the fate  and transport of organic
              pollutants in wetlands and aquatic  systems.  The information accrued from this
              project should aid  those individuals responsible for managing ecosystems, and
              help  engineers properly design and construct wetlands for purposes of 
              remediating nonpoint source pollutants.
