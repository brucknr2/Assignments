Abstract    :
                9316356  Herbig  New technological advances will be exploited to test accepted
              ideas  about the formation of stars.  Young clusters will be searched for 
              emission line stars and spectra of A stars will be obtained to find  those with
              weak emission.  A search will be conducted for newly  formed stars far from the
              galactic plane where it has been thought  that star formation ceased long ago. 
              Searches will be conducted  for young stars with binary companions.  ***
