Abstract    :
              9316344  McCaffrey    This research is to study the 100 by 30 km Toba
              depression, within the Sumatra volcanic arc.  The Toba depression is the
              world's largest Quaternary resurgent caldera.  It formed 74,000 years ago
              during a massive eruption that dispersed over 2800 cubic kilometers of ash over
              an area of at least 4 million square km.  Toba's magma system is presumably in
              a period of repose between major eruptive events.  This study combines seismic
              and petrologic investigations with the goals of understanding the origin and
              evolution of the Toba magma system, the distribution of melt within it, and its
              relation to deep (subducted slab) and shallow (crustal) structures.  Magma
              distribution and its relation to slab and surface faults will be assessed by
              tomographic and tectonic analyses of seismological data from shallow
              earthquakes near Toba, from intermediate-depth earthquakes in a possible tear
              in the subducted slab beneath Toba, and from teleseisms, all recorded on a
              48-station seismograph array.  This combined petrologic and geophysical
              approach will provide valuable constraints on the evolution and
              volcanic/seismic activity of large-volume, silicic magma reservoirs, and of
              other convergent-margin magma systems.  This research is a component of the
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***    ??
