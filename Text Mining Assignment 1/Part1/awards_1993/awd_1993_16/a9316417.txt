Abstract    :
              9316417  McKinney    In order to help connect macroevolutionary patterns to
              ecological  processes, PI will examine patterns of abundance in fossil 
              populations through a model that focuses on the patchy nature of  the
              geographic distribution of most populations.  The model will be  tested using
              benthic foraminifera from a core of Paleogene strata  from Georgia.
