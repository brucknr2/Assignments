Abstract    :
              9316998  Johnson  This award is the starter grant portion of Dr. Johnson's 
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry award. The broad  theme of the
              research deals with the synthesis and reactivity  of low coordinate and alkyne
              derivatives of Group 13, 14 and 15  elements. Three areas will be explored: 
              (1) The synthesis and characterization of monovalent clusters  of boron,
              aluminum and gallium as building blocks for the  preparation of larger
              heteroatomic clusters of high  nuclearity;(2) synthesis and characterization of
               multiply-bonded linear and cyclic compounds of boron such as  borylenes and
              diborabenzene, and;  (3) synthesis and characterization of linear networks,
              ring  compounds and cages composed of alkynes and main group  elements. These
              functionalized alkynes will exhibit a variety  of unusual structural and
              electronic properties.  %%%  This research will advance the fundamental
              structural chemistry  of Group 13-15 elements by the rational design and
              synthesis of  unusual structures modeled after the all-carbon analogs.  ***
