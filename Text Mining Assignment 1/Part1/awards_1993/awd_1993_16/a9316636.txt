Abstract    :
              9316636  Chester       This Research Planning Grant project will characterize
              the  boundaries of rotated crustal blocks in the San Gabriel mountain, 
              California, in order to better understand block rotation in major  strike-slip
              fault zones.  A preliminary field study will map  brittle faults in the area to
              find the relationships among fault-  slip, length and thickness.  This
              preliminary study will be used to  prepare a standard research grant proposal. 
              In addition, the data  will be used to make a tectonic reconstruction of the
              San Gabriel  mountains region of southern California.
