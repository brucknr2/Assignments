Abstract    :
              9316534 Williamson Recent global decreases in stratospheric ozone induced
              largely by anthropogenic release of chlorofluorocarbons have led to a
              corresponding increase in ultraviolet radiation that is potentially damaging to
              natural ecosystems.  While the most serious changes have been in polar regions,
              little is known about how either freshwater ecosystems or higher trophic levels
              may respond to changes in ultraviolet radiation.  This workshop will proposed
              to gather international experts in ultraviolet-B radiation and freshwater
              ecosystems.  The workshop will assemble scientists to assess what is known and
              what needs to be known about how ultraviolet-B radiation influences freshwater
              ecosystems.  A priority list of critical research objectives with a special
              focus on higher trophic levels will be developed.  The meeting will evaluate
              current instrumentation and biological dosimeter techniques for quantifying
              ultraviolet-B radiation in the water column, provide a special lecture series
              to students and faculty from area universities, and encourage collaboration
              from different disciplines, countries, and regions.  The proceedings will be
              published as a special volume of the journal Archiv fur Hydrobiologia. ***
