Abstract    :
              9316954  O'Hara       The behavior of fluids at depth in deforming continental
              crust  is of current interest.  This study will examine retrograde  greenschist
              to lower amphibolite grade mylonites in the Blue Ridge  province of North
              Carolina and Virginia where preliminary data  suggest an inverse relationship
              between metamorphic grade and bulk-  rock chemical change.  The work involve
              characterization of mineral  assemblages, oxygen isotopes and mineral
              chemistries.  Results will  have important implications for understanding the
              behavior of  hydrothermal fluids at depth in the continental crust.
