Abstract    :
                9304560  Silver     This PASSCAL field project will examine the deep structure
              of the  South American Altiplano, one of the world's highest and largest 
              plateaus with an average elevation of nearly 4 km, a crustal  thickness of 65
              km and area of over 600,000 square km at the  intersection of southern Peru,
              western Bolivia, and northern Chile.   The investigation will test theories of
              formation of this plateau  and of mountain-building in general.  The
              investigators will deploy  20 PASSCAL seismic stations across the region to
              determine  variations in crustal thickness, structure of the underlying mantle 
              wedge, and shear wave splitting which is an indication of the  fabric and
              distortion history of the rock.  A collaboration in  deployment and analysis is
              planned with the French ORSTOM Program  and with South American scientists. 
              This active seismic area,  where the oceanic plate is subducted under the
              continent, is an  analog to the U.S. Pacific Northwest tectonic regime.  This 
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction  Program.
