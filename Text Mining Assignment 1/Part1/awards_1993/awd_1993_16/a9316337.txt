Abstract    :
              9316337  Wyss                             This project involves the production
              of modern, portable software  tools that will enhance researchers' capabilities
              throughout the  seismological community by efficiently and effectively
              creating,  managing and using seismological databases.  This work is in 
              collaboration with U.S. Geological Survey scientists and other  Alaska
              institutes.  It will build on prior efforts to develop the  Seismic Unified
              Data System (SUDS).  One of the first  implementations of the product will be
              to implement a relational  database from the approximately 4,000 earthquakes
              and one terabyte  of continuous data annually recorded by the Alaska
              Seismograph  Network at the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska, 
              Fairbanks to aid in research, understanding and mitigation of  seismic and
              volcanic hazards.  This research is a component of the  National Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
