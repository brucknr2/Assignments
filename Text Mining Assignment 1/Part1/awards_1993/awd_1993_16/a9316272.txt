Abstract    :
              Nishiizumi  9316272  This award supports a project to measure 36Cl and 41Ca in
              Antarctic  meteorites in order to estimate terrestrial ages of the  meteorites.
               This work is a collaborative effort between the  University of California,
              Berkeley, and the Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory.  When combined with
              other chemical and  isotopic data on the meteorites, the terrestrial ages allow
               inferences about solar system history and orbital trajectories of  the
              meteorites prior to collision with Earth.  The terrestrial  ages are also
              valuable for glaciological studies of the Antarctic  ice sheet, or
              geomorphological studies of the ice-free areas, on  which the meteorites are
              found.  For ice sheets, they provide an  estimate of the time that the ice
              sheet has been concentrating  debris and ice in the particular ablation region
              in which the  meteorite is found.  This information is useful input to dynamic 
              models of the ice sheet.  For ice-free regions, the meteorites,  provide an
              estimate of the antiquity of the geomorphic surface.   In conjunction with
              exposure ages, the terrestrial ages provide  useful information about past
              glaciation of the presently ice-  free areas.  The terrestrial ages that this
              work will produce  represent a useful investment in baseline data for research
              in  geomorphology and glaciology.
