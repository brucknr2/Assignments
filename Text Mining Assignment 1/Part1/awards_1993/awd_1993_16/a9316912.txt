Abstract    :
              9316912  Westpheling  Streptomyces are Gram-positive soil bacteria that are of
              special  interest because of their remarkably complex morphological 
              development and because they produce as secondary metabolites most  of the
              antibiotics used in human and animal health care.  Although  little is
              understood about the molecular physiology of these  bacteria, it is apparent
              that the regulation of carbon utilization  is of central importance in the gene
              expression pathways for both  morphological development and antibiotic
              biosynthesis.  To gain an  understanding of the mechanism of catabolite control
              in  Streptomyces we are studying the regulation of a family of genes  involved
              in the utilization of chitin, a complex carbohydrate and  a major source of
              carbon in the soil.  The synthesis of chitinase  enzymes is tightly repressed
              by glucose and strongly induced by  chitin.  In preliminary work we have
              established that regulation  for at least one of the chitin.  In preliminary
              work we have  established that regulation for at least one of the chitinase 
              genes, chi63, occurs at the level of transcription initiation.  We  have been a
              systematic analysis of mutations within the promoter  region of chi63 and used
              a transcriptional fusion to the xy1E  reporter gene, to identify chromosomal
              mutations that define the  pathway for glucose repression and chitin induction
              of chitinase  synthesis.  We are defining the elements of the chitinase
              promoters  that determine regulation and promoter activity; beginning a study 
              to identify and characterize genes that act to facilitate the  global
              regulation of catabolite repression in Streptomyces.  %%%  We hope as a result 
              of this work to contribute to the  understanding of gene regulation in an
              important class of bacteria  where relatively little is known about the way in
              which gene  expression is controlled.  ***
