Abstract    :
                EAR-9316628    Wright, Herbert, Ito, Emi, Univ. of Minnesota    GRGC: 
              Post-Illinoian vegetational and climatic history of the  Middle West: 
              Comparisons with European history    PIs, in collaboration with the Illinois
              Geological Survey, will  conduct pollen analysis covering the time from the
              penultimate  glaciation through the latest interglacial, up to the present (the
               last 130,000 years), south of the extent of the last glacier in  central North
              America.  A transect of cores will be taken across a  drained lake basin in
              southern Illinois.  Analyses will be  conducted of pollen (in detail), as well
              as of ostracodes and plant  macrofossils; C-14 dating, lithologic, and other
              geochemical  analyses will also be done.  Results will be correlated with 
              similar European studies and with the marine sediment-core record  of ice sheet
              volume.  Striking variations in vegetation suggest  conspicuous climate changes
              during these times and have  implications for understanding, for example, the
              history of jet  stream migration, precipitation, and tree migration rates as 
              indicators of insolation and climate.
