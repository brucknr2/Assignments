Abstract    :
                  9316241  Williams    Research under this grant supports work associated with
              clusters of  galaxies.  Additional funds are being provided to carry out radio 
              mapping of approximately 12 new compact groups of galaxies.  This  will double
              the sample of galaxies studied and make it possible to  find compact groups of
              galaxies in different stages of merging into  each other.  At the present time
              the existing sample is too small  to draw any definitive conclusions about how
              the neutral hydrogen  in compact groups of galaxies evolves as the entire group
              coalesces  into a single object.  ***
