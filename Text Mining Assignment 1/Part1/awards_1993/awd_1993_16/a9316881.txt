Abstract    :
              9316881  Self  We propose that large volume basaltic lavas, such as the CRB 
              lavas, achieved their great flow length by semi-continuous  output of magma and
              thermally efficient emplacement, which  allowed lavas to spread as far as
              topography would permit  (in some cases > 500 km).  The consensus of research 
              undertaken is that flood basalt lavas of the Columbia River  province were
              erupted as thermally efficient, large-scale  pahoehoe sheet flows; any one flow
              field grew progressively  over a considerable time-span (months to years!).  We
               propose continued investigation into emplacement mechanisms  of flood basalt
              lavas with the aim of refining our current  ideas on the rate at which they
              were erupted, and what the  possible impact of a flood basalt eruption, or
              series of  eruptions, was on the atmosphere.  In particular, this grant  will
              enable Sara Finnemore to complete her PhD work on this  project.
