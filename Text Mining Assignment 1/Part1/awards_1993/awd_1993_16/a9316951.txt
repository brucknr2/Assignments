Abstract    :
              9316951  Mattinson       This award provides one-half the funding needed to
              modernize  a thermal ionization source mass spectrometer operated in the 
              Department of Geological Sciences at the University of California  at Santa
              Barbara. The institution is committed to providing the  remaining funds
              necessary for the project.       The research projects necessitating the
              upgrade include  geochronology of very small samples using uranium-lead
              isotopes,  tracer studies of mantle processes, and uranium disequilibrium 
              dating studies of marine carbonate materials. The upgrades to the  instrument
              will enhance its ability to analyze very small amounts  of samples, a basic
              requirement of the research.  ***
