Abstract    :
              9316831  Williams  The PI and his collaborators have used a multi-faceted
              approach,  combining field observations with sophisticated chemical analysis 
              and laboratory modeling, to examine emplacement histories of  silicic lava
              flows and domes.  In the proposed ABR, they will  continue this line of
              research.  A key objective of their studies  is assessment of the hazard
              associated with explosive volcanic  eruptions.
