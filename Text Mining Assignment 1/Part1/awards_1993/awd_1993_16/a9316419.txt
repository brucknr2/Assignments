Abstract    :
              9316419  Mehldahl  As a young, actively rifting ocean basin, the Gulf of
              California  represents an excellent opportunity to combine studies of modern 
              marine sedimentary environments and faunas with studies of the  Neogene rock
              record to understand better the evolution of rift  basins and the fossil record
              that they accumulate.  PI will provide  models of lithofacies, biofacies and
              taphofacies for  paleoenvironmental analysis of marine rift basins, with
              specific  application to tectonic evolution of the Gulf of California.  He 
              will also investigate factors that control time-averaging and  taphonomy in
              fossil assemblages.  Collaboration is established with  Mexican colleagues.
