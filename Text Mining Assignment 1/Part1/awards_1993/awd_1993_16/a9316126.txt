Abstract    :
              9316126  LaBelle  Research funded by NSF during the past year has proven that
              using  inexpensive ground-based instrumentation, it is possible to detect  at
              least two types of radio phenomena at LF/MF/HF frquencoes (0.05-  5.0 MHz) in
              the auroral zone.  These include narrowband emissions  near twice and three
              times the ionospheric electron gyrofrequency  and broadband noise enhancements
              with nulls in the spectrum near  harmonies of the gyrofrequency.  Although
              models have been proposed  for both these phenomena, their cause is
              undetermined, as are the  range and time variation of their occurrence.  We
              propose to make  more advanced measurements of these wave phenomena, including 
              measurements from a chain of stations, with the following  objectives: (1) to
              determine the latitude and time dependence of  the waves; (2) to test several
              specific models for their  generation, using wave data and complementary
              ionosonde,  magnetometer, riometer, and all-sky camera data; and (3) to explore
               the use of these wave observations in combination with CANOPUS/ISTO 
              instrumentation as a ground-based diagnostic of the auroral  ionosphere. 
              Although radio emissions comprise a small fraction of  the total energy of the
              Aurora, they may provide important clues to  the more energetic processes, in
              analogy to the way in which solar  radio emissions have been used to infer the
              processes taking place  in the solar corona.  ***
