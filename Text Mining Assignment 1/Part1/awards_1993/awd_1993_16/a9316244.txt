Abstract    :
                9316244  Honzatko  The recent determination of the three-dimensional structure
              of the  synthetase from E. coli reveals a folding topology of the  polypeptide
              chain heretofore unobserved in any other protein  structure.  yet, the
              synthetase has residues which correspond to  the GTP-binding residues of the
              p21ras protein.  Given the high  level of sequence similarity between
              synthetases from bacteria to  mammals, the structure of the E. coli enzyme
              should provide a  reasonable basis for understanding structure-function
              relationships  of synthetases from a wide variety of species.     Four
              different crystal forms of adenylosuccinate synthetase from E.  coli are under
              investigation.  Each of the crystal forms diffracts  to a resolution of at
              least 2.8A.  The four crystal forms will be  used in the study of ligand-enzyme
              complexes by the method of X-ray  diffraction.  The X-ray diffraction studies
              will probe the  conformational response of the synthetase to each substrate or 
              substrate analogue individually and in combination.  In addition to  the
              diffraction studies, a series of directed mutations will be  performed on the
              enzyme, in order to confirm the significance of  specific residues in
              catalysis, substrate binding, and/or the  structural integrity of the enzyme. 
              The structure of a limited  number of mutant synthetases will be determined, in
              order to better  understand how structural changes give rise to the altered 
              properties of the mutants.  Each of the structures above will be  refined,
              using HPCC facilities and state-of-the-art software.   %%%  The proposed
              investigations will reveal the structural basis for  mechanisms of catalysis
              and inhibition of adenylosuccinate  synthetase from Esherichia coli
              Adenylosuccinate synthetase governs  the first committed step in the de novo
              synthesis of adenine  nucleotides, converting the substrates Mg2+-GDP, and
              phosphate.   Adenine nucleotides support many biochemical functions, perhaps
              the  most important of which is the synthesis of proteins, RNA  and DNA.  ***
