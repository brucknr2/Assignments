Abstract    :
              9316066  Warner      The PI has undertaken a study of the magnetic petrology of
              lower crustal rocks.  The general long-term goal is to increase our
              understanding of lower crustal magnetization through the study of xenoliths,
              crustal cross sections, etc.  He will analyze xenolith samples from convergent
              volcanic arcs (Aleutian and Japanese islands) and continental rift zones (Rio
              Grande and West Antarctic rifts), and investigate the effects of prograde
              (amphibolite to granulite facies) metamorphism in a traverse through lower
              crustal rocks exposed in the Kohistan arc, Pakistan.  The samples will be
              analyzed via a dual approach involving magnetic property measurements (initial
              susceptibilities, natural and saturation isothermal remanence, Curie points,
              magnetic hysteresis, etc.), supplemented by petrographic and microprobe
              studies.  ****
