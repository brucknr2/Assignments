Abstract    :
              9316841  Tilton  This project will continue parallel isotopic studies of 
              coesite-bearing metamorphic rocks in the Dora Maira massif,  Italian West Alps,
              and the Dabie Mountains, south central  China.  Recent work in these
              continental collision zones  indicate that continental crustal material has
              been  subducted to depths of at least 100 km, yet has maintained  its original
              crustal character throughout subduction and  exhumation.  The PI proposes to
              conduct isotopic studies in  these orogenic belts, which are excellent for
              delineating  rates of processes and time and style of petrogenetic  settings. 
              The two main purposes of the project are: (1) to  develop better understanding
              of geochronometric systems in  ultra high-pressure rocks by resolving
              differences in the U-  Pb and Ar-Ar systems, contrasting Th and U inheritance
              in  monazite, and testing the applicability of the Sm-Nd system;  and (2) to
              provide age and isotopic evidence for geologic  and petrogenetic  evolution of
              the collisional and orogenic  belts.
