Abstract    :
              9316051  Bodnar  The porphyry copper deposits are major producers of copper  as
              well as molybdenum, zinc, lead, gold, silver, arsenic,  selenium and other
              metals.  It is proposed to investigate  sources of the metals in porphyry
              copper deposits by  conducting synchrotron XRF (SXRF) analyses of carefully 
              selected fluid inclusions from 6 ore deposits representing a  wide range in
              vertical and lateral positions within the  larger magmatic-hydrothermal system.
               Preliminary SXRF  analyses of samples from the Red Mountain and Morenci, AZ, 
              and the Santa Rita, NM., porphyry systems document the  feasibility of
              conducting nondestructive analyses of  individual fluid inclusions from these
              deposits.  Most of  the samples to be studied have previously been
              characterized  through detailed petrography, microthermometric and  geochemical
              analysis, and their position within the  paragenetic sequence and their
              relationship to hypogene  copper mineralization are well understood.  Results
              from  this study will improve our understanding of the genesis of  this
              important ore deposit type by identifying which fluids  are carrying metals and
              where these fluids are distributed  vertically and laterally within the
              magmatic-hydrothermal  system.
