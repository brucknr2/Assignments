Abstract    :
              9316960  Pospichal       PIs will examine magnitude, mode and nature of
              extinctions  across the K/T boundary for calcareous nannofossils by conducting 
              a global synthesis.  They will 1) address issues of magnitude and 
              synchroneity, reworking and survivorship; 2) quantitatively analyze 
              assemblages to address changes before the boundary and issues of  differing
              geographic response; 3) conduct stable isotope analysis  of Thoracosphaera to
              assess impact on bulk analyses of isotopes.
