Abstract    :
                        9316737  Spanswick  The long term goal of the project is to evaluate
              the transport and  metabolic steps in the seed portion of the partitioning
              pathway by  estimating their flux control coefficients.  This will provide a 
              quantitative assessment of their limitation to the overall flux.   Peas will be
              used as a model system.  In this first stage of the  project, a steady state
              13CO2 labeling system will be constructed  for use with a nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  In  addition an NMR probe capable of detecting
              13C and 1H resonances  will be modified to permit insertion from the top of the
              NMR  machine, to accomodate a developing pea fruit and to perform  imaging of
              1H associated with sugar molecules using a double pulse  technique.  The main
              objective is to achieve a functioning system  that combines steady state
              labeling with non-destructive detection  of 13C in the developig fruit by NMR.
