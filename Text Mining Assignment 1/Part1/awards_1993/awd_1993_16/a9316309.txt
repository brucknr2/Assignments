Abstract    :
              9316309  Harrison  This project addresses phase equilibria and aqueous 
              solubilities of ferroan calcites and calcian siderites on  the CaCO3 and FeCO3
              binary join.  The project involves an  experimental study of ferroan carbonate
              minerals at  temperatures between 100 to 500oC and pressures between 1  bar and
              5 kilobars.  From these experimental measurements,  thermodynamic properties
              and solid solution mixing models  can be derived and used to predict the
              controls on  equilibrium precipitation in shallow crustal environments.  These
              thermodynamic results are fundamental parameters for  computer simulations of
              diagenetic reactions and their  control on the porosity and permeability
              evolution of  sedimentary rocks.
