Abstract    :
              9316143  Engel       This award provides one-half the funding required for the 
              acquisition of a bench-top gas chromatograph/isotope ratio mass  spectrometer,
              or GC/IRMS, system to be installed and operated in  the School of Geology and
              Geophysics at the University of Oklahoma.  The institution is committed to
              providing the remaining funds  necessary. The GC/IRMS system will be used in
              research on the   isotopic composition of specific amino acids and its possible
                effect on the interpretation of bulk isotopic analyses of organic  remains in
              fossils.  ***
