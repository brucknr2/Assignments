                @H H '      This research is to study the seismic structure of the Ontong
              Java Plateau, the largest expression of igneous activity of the ocean floor. 
              Four seismic stations composed of PASSCAL instruments will be deployed for two
              years on the Micronesian islands of Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae and Nauru. 
              Earthquake sources in the Solomon subduction zone will be used to investigate
              the dispersion of surface waves over the plateau to measure seismic structure
              to depths on the order of 200 km.  Concurrently, a number of body wave
              experiments will be conducted targeting the structural anisotropy of the crust
              and upper mantle in the area.  The work is expected to provide answers to such
              questions as the exact thickness of the crust, the nature of the deep crust,
              the structure of the mantle (lid and underlying low velocity zone) of the
              plateau, and the extent and direction of anisotropy in the upper mantle.  In
              turn, these parameters will put constraints on the environment and mechani sm
              of emplacement of the plateau in the Cretaceous. ***
