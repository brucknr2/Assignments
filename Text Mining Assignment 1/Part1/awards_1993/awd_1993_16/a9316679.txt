Abstract    :
              9316679  Sablik      This award will support the travel of Dr. Martin J. Sablik
              of the  Instrumentation and Space Research Division of the Southwest  Research
              Institute in San Antonio, Texas, for a one month visit  to Australia in order
              to conduct collaborative research with        Dr. Richard Langman at the
              University of Tasmania. The focus of  the research is to develop a new model
              for stress measurement.    Dr. Sablik will use his experience with
              magnetomechanical  hysteresis modeling to account for results obtained with the
               rotation method, a magnetic technique originated by Dr. Langman  for measuring
              stress in magnetic materials, in particular in  cases of biaxial stress. The
              project results are expected to be  useful for measuring stresses in railroad
              wheels and for  measuring stresses in gas and oil pipelines. Such stress 
              measurements would be most beneficial to railroad and pipeline  operators in
              helping to detect high stress situations which might  lead to rupture, and
              thereby enable timely remedial action to be  taken.
