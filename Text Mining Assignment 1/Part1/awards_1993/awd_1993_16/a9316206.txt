Abstract    :
              9316206  Ballester  The goal of this project is to characterize the function of
              three  newly identified genes that inhibit the RAS-cAMP pathway in yeast. 
              Determination of their mechanism of action will help advance our  understanding
              of RAS action and the events involved in normal cell  growth.  Preliminary
              evidence discussed in a later section suggest  that these genes play important
              roles in yeast.  ESP18 encodes a  serine and threonine rich protein and is an
              essential gene that  inhibits the function of RAS.  It is particularly
              interesting  because it may encode a new class of proteins that are able to 
              regulate Ras activity.  IKS4 encodes a putative serine and  threonine protein
              kinase that opposes the function of the cAMP-  dependent protein kinase and it
              is  a candidate for a growth  inhibitor in yeast.  SCP7 encodes another serine
              and threonine rich  protein that inhibits the function of adenylate cyclase and
              may be  part of a complex that includes adenylate cyclase and the  associated
              protein, Cap.  The specific aims of this research are:   (1) To determine the
              function of the ESP18 gene:  We will determine  the function of the ESP18 gene
              by identifying other molecules that  interact directly or are within the same
              pathway as ESP18.  This  will be accomplished by the isolation and
              characterization of  extragenic mutants of an ESP18 temperature sensitive
              mutant. (2) To  characterize the function of the IKS4 gene:  We will
              characterize  the function of the IKS4 gene by performing genetic analysis to 
              determine its relation to other protein kinases that affect the  RAS-cAMP
              pathway in yeast.  (3) To better define the role of the  SCP7 gene in the
              function of adenylate cyclase by performing  genetic analysis to determine its
              relation to adenylate cyclase and  the associated protein, Cap.  We will also
              determine if the product  of the SCP7 gene associates with adenylate cyclase or
              Cap by co-  immunoprecipitiation of epitope tagged proteins.  %%%  The RAS
              genes of yeast are similar to cancer  causing genes of  animals.  This research
              could provide insight into the origins of  cancer.  ***
