Abstract    :
              9316015  Aupperle      This proposal requests $586,000 for twelve months to
              establish a  node ("CNSS") on the ANSNET Backbone at Albuquerque, with tail 
              circuits to end-nodes ("ENSS") at Phillips and SNLA.               Funding for
              this effort is being provided entirely by the Air Force  and the Department of
              Energy.    Since the traffic to be carried over this segment of the ANSNET 
              Backbone is entirely for the purposes of research and education  consistent
              with the NSFNET Backbone Services Acceptable Use Policy,  full connectivity
              will be established with the rest of the NSFNET;  the node in Albuquerque
              becomes therefore essentially another  connection for the NSFNET Backbone
              Service.    IN addition to supporting the open networking needs of its sponsors
               (USAF and DoE), this project is intended to be used by New Mexico's  higher
              education, pre-college, and informal education communities  to support the
              general  goals of the National Research and  Education Network (NREN) program;
              it is also consistent with  Presidential and Congressional intent for the
              National Information  Infrastructure.
