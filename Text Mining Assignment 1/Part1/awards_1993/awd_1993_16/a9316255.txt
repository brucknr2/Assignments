Abstract    :
              9316255  Patchett  This project will continue Hf and other isotopic research 
              into problems of crustal and mantle chemical evolution, with  two main thrusts:
               (1) to complete study of granitoids  melted from different crustal sources,
              and (2) to undertake  a new effort to definitively determine the depleted
              mantle  source of new crust over geologic time.  Terranes have been  selected
              from Greenland, Australia, Africa, Canada, USA and  Saudi Arabia as
              representing known or potential juvenile  additions to the continents over
              3.8-0.7 Ga.  Other terranes  and collaborations may become necessary to fully
              determine  the depleted source evolution.  This data should constitute  a firm
              basis for modeling by the PIs and others of crust-  mantle evolution 4.0 Ga to
              present.
