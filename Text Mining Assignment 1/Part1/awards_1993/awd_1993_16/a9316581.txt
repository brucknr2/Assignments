Abstract    :
              9316581  Holt                             This research involves the
              investigation of the kinematics of  deforming continental lithosphere in
              regions such as Asia, Iran,  New Zealand, and Japan.  Plate motions are an
              important process on  the earth since they are responsible for almost all of
              the observed  surface deformation.  While rigid plate models do an excellent
              job  in matching observations globally, relative motion models within 
              continental lithosphere are more complex.  Yet the relative  motions, or
              velocity gradient tensor, are fundamental to the  understanding of the dynamics
              of deformation, especially seismic  hazard.  Strain rates within regions with
              adequate deformation rate  data will be modeled using continuous sets of
              functions such as  splines.  The goal is to significantly advance the
              understanding of  the kinematics and dynamics of several complicated regions of
               deforming continental lithosphere.  This research is a component of  the
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
