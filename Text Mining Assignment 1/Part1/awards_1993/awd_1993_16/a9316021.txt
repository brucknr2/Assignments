Abstract    :
              9316021  DiPietro       In the Pakistan Himalayan orogen, the Himalayan arc
              bends  sharply around a feature known as the western Himalayan syntaxis.   The
              purpose of this study is to develop a tectonic synthesis of the  India-Kohistan
              collision with special emphasis on the origin and  development of the Indus
              syntaxis and the Swat-Peshawar Basin  region of Pakistan.  Results will provide
              insight to nature and  tectonic development of the western Himalayan syntaxis
              and its role  in the development of the Himalayan orogen.
