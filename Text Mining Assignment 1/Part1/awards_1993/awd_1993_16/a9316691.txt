Abstract    :
              9316691  Charles    An impressive network of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic
              records from  ice cores, lake cores, deep sea cores and tree rings can now be 
              compiled for a variety of time periods.  These records potentially  offer
              quantitative insight to past changes in climate processes,  but their true
              climatic significance cannot be fully realized  without knowledge of the
              fundamental driving forces for isotopes in  precipitation.  Simple air parcel
              models cannot account for the  range of processes which control regional
              isotope distributions,  and therefore the coupling of isotope tracers to a
              general  circulation model (GCM) represents a necessary first step towards  a
              more complete understanding of the isotope signals recorded in  the geologic
              record.  We propose to investigate these isotopic  records by means of the
              Goddard Institute for Space Studies General  Circulation Model (GISS GCM).  The
              major issue we will pursue is  how the changes in sourcewater characteristics,
              air mass  trajectories, and air mass mixing-- all factors which must have 
              varied over climate cycles with the major components of the climate 
              system--affect regional isotopic distributions.  Over the next two  years, we
              will conduct a number of paleoclimatic simulations to  determine the
              sensitivity of the model moisture source  contributions and isotope fields to
              specific changes in boundary  conditions (ice sheets, sea ice, sea surface
              temperature, etc.)   Results of the paleoclimatic simulations will be compared
              to the  observations, which we will compile.  This data-model comparison  will
              help identify the components of Northern Hemisphere climate  system that are
              most important in shaping the isotope records.  The  comparison will also
              provide a test for the reliability and  sensitivity of the GCM's hydrological
              cycle.
