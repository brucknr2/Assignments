Abstract    :
              9316254  Carey  The objective of this study is to explore the behavior of  flows
              that enter the sea by using observations on submarine  pyroclastic flow
              deposits from the 1883 eruption of Krakatau  volcano and laboratory experiments
              designed to examine  certain aspects of pyroclastic flow/water interactions. 
              Previous work on the submarine deposits of Krakatau have  demonstrated the
              deposition of hot pyroclastic flows in  shallow water (<40 m).  New studies
              will examine the  deposits that were laid down in deep water (>100 m depth). 
              Samples from these deposits will be used to construct a  depositional facies
              model for the transition from shallow to  deep water, and to assess the
              temperature of  emplacement.  Laboratory experiments will examine 1) the
              behavior of  particle-laden gravity currents discharged into a tank of  ambient
              fluid of contrasting density and 2) the interactions  of hot volcanic particles
              and water.  These experiments  should provide insights into the different types
              of mixing  behavior that are likely to take place when hot flows enter  the
              ocean.
