Abstract    :
              9316088  Plummer      This award will partially support travel costs associated
              with  the visits by Professor Michael Plummer of the Department of  
              Mathematics at Vanderbilt University to conduct collaborative  work with Prof.
              Derek Allan Holton and Dr. Robert Aldred of the  Department of Mathematics and
              Statistics at the University of  Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand and with Prof.
              Louis Caccetta   from the Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Australia. 
              The proposed work is in the areas of matching extension and  cyclability in
              graphs. Both concepts admit immediate translation  to problems involving
              communications networks.    Dr. Plummer will spend one month with Dr. Caccetta
              on joint  research on matching extension. Matching in a graph is a set of 
              independent edges with no two of these edges sharing a common  vertex. The
              concept is finding increased utilization in   mathematical applications.    The
              proposer will then spend two months working with the  investigators in New
              Zealand. This group has developed valuable  expertise on cyclic connectivity
              and symmetry of graphs. This   collaborative activity draws together the work
              in both Australia  and New Zealand with that of the American investigator.
