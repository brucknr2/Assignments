Abstract    :
              9316114  Jonas  This project will result in the identification of genes
              transcribed  by alternate sigma factors in the Gram positive prokaryote, 
              Bacillus subtilis.  Genes having promoters recognized by a  particular sigma
              factor will be identified using a transposon  engineered to contain a reporter
              gene (Tn917lac), which should  generate random insertional mutations (and
              transcriptional fusions)  in the chromosome of B. subtilis.  These mutations
              will be screened  in strains of B. subtilis containing inducible copies (under 
              control of the spac promoter) of the structural genes for the  active forms of
              B. or E. genes bearing insertion that are induced  by IPTG in such a system
              will be mapped, cloned, and sequenced.   The promoter regions of these genes
              will be analyzed, providing  information concerning regulatory sequences used
              by alternative  sigma factors.  The functions of these genes may be revealed by
              the  phenotype of the insertional mutants, or by homology with the  sequences
              of genes with known functions.  We will attempt to  determine the role the
              alternative sigma factor plays in vivo by  recognition of the function of the
              genes in the regulon.  %%%  The knowledge gained concerning genetic regulation
              may prove useful  to the fermentation industry, which could benefit from using 
              alternate sigma factors in over producing gene product in bacteria.  ***
