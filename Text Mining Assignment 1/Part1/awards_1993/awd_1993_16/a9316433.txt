Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9316433         Bower           "Neural Simulation Demonstrations at
              the Society for Neuroscience Annual  Meeting and at the Second Annual
              Computation & Neural Systems Meeting"    This project is to demonstrate state
              of the art computer simulation techniques in  computational neuroscience at two
              major scientific meetings.  One meeting, the  second annual Computation and
              Neural Systems meeting will be held the first  week of August in Washington DC.
               Approximately 300 scientists are expected  to register and present a wide
              range of research results in computational  neuroscience.  The second meeting
              is the annual meeting of the Society for  Neuroscience and will also be held in
              Washington, D.C. at the beginning of  November.  This meeting will register
              upwards of 15,000 neurobiologists and  represents the premier meeting on
              neurobiology in the world.  The primary  purpose of the demonstrations are to
              expose large numbers of neuroscientists  to the  use of computer simulation
              techniques in neurobiology.  In addition, the  project will provide technical
              information on the methods used in these  simulations, the range of simulation
              software currently available, and  demonstrations of several aspects of new
              computer technology that are  relevant to efforts to simulate and understand
              the brain.     This project is supported by the Division of Integrative Biology
              and  Neuroscience and the Computational Biology Activities Program.***
