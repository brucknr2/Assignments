Abstract    :
              9316937  Grossman       This award provides 35% of the funding required to 
              purchase an automated carbonate reaction system for the  preparation of samples
              prior to mass spectrometric analysis.  The equipment is to be installed and
              operated in the mass  spectrometry laboratory in the Department of  Geology at
              the  Texas A & M University. Texas A & M University is committed  to providing
              the remaining funds needed for the purchase.       The Principal Investigator
              and colleagues are engaged  in research to understand the relations between
              climate  changes and isotopic variation signals as seen in the carbon  and
              oxygen isotopic composition of carbonate shelled  organisms living in the
              ocean. The work requires analysis of  large numbers of small carbonate samples
              for which the new  automated sample preparation system is needed.  ***
