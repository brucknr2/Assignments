Abstract    :
              9316511  Guest  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program 
              ("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the
              eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B.
              Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here concerns the
              dynamics of the forcing of the sea ice  cover and the upper ocean by the
              atmosphere.  Measurements and  analyses will include the wind stress and
              atmospheric heat fluxes,  and upward and downward components of short and long
              wave  radiation.  An on-board rawinsonde system will obtain daily  profiles
              wind, temperature, humidity, and pressure through the  troposphere, and an
              acoustic sounder will continuously monitor the  structure of the lower
              atmosphere.  Satellite data and imagery will  be used to determine the regional
              and mesoscale context of the  point measurements from the ship.  The major goal
              of this component  of Anzflux is to provide for the continuity of heat exchange
               measurements through the ocean/ice interface into the atmosphere.    These
              measurements, in conjunction with the other concurrent  experiments to quantify
              the energy brought to the underside of the  ice, will form the basis of a
              regional study of the processes  responsible for the relatively thick upper
              mixed layer and thin ice  cover.  It is believed that these conditions are only
              marginally  stable, and are maintained by a relatively high upward heat flux, 
              which, if interrupted, could lead to deep vertical convection, and  a
              significant change in the oceanic climate.  ***
