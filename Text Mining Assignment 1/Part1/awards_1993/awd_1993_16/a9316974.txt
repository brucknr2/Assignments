Abstract    :
              9316974  Stump       The Himalaya provides an opportunity to study continent- 
              continent orogenesis.  This project will collect fission-track data  and
              structural information from the Everest area of eastern Nepal  to address the
              thermotectonic and exhumation history of the Higher  Himalaya.  Results will be
              useful in determining uplift dynamics  and climatic/environmental effects of
              the Himalaya's rise.
