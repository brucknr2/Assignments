Abstract    :
              9316059  Einaudi  The focus of recent studies of epithermal deposits has been 
              on sources and physiochemical characteristics of  hydrothermal fluids in  the
              context of geothermal analogy.  Less well studied are links between such fluids
              and tectonic-  volcanic evolution in a given ore district.  This link will  be
              studied in the Jarbidge Rhyolite and associated  epithermal Au-Ag veins,
              Jarbidge mining district, Nevada.  The primary questions to be addressed are: 
              (1) style of  volcanism and relation to tectonics and structural  evolution,
              (2) spatial and temporal links between  hydrothermal activity and the
              plutonic-volcanic-tectonic  cycle, (3) absolute age, duration, and cyclicity of
               faulting, volcanism, and hydrothermal activity, and (4)  vertical and lateral
              changes in hydrology and hydrothermal  fluid characteristics as a function of
              time, space, and  topographic/recharge characteristics at the paleosurface. 
              Detailed mapping will document the space-time distribution  and relative ages
              of volcanic rocks, faults, and  hydrothermal veins and alteration.  Sample
              collection,  binocular study of rock slabs and petrographic studies of  thin
              sections will be concurrent with mapping.  Laboratory  studies will focus on
              mineralogical and chemical  characterization of volcanic rocks and hydrothermal
               alteration products, fluid inclusion studies of vein  minerals, and age dating
              of sanidine and adularia by high-  precision 40Ar/39Ar techniques.  The
              research will allow  further interpretation of the tectonic and volcanic
              control  of other epithermal districts.
