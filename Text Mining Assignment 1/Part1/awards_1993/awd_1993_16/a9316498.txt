Abstract    :
              9316498  Stanton  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program 
              ("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the
              eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B.
              Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here is the
              deployment of three instrument systems to  measure momentum, heat, and salt
              fluxes from the pycnocline (a  surface separating higher density deep water
              from lower density  surface water) upward to the ocean-ice interface.  In the
              surface  layer these instrument systems will provide a hierarchy of direct 
              flux and dissipation measurements which will identify several  dynamically
              distinct layers: the surface constant stress layer, the  turbulent boundary
              layer, and the active mixed layer.  Continuous  time series of these
              measurements will be made at each of the two  fifteen day drift stations to
              observe both quiescent background  conditions, and the response of the upper
              ocean to the short,  severe, storm systems that are characteristic of the area.
                  These measurements, in conjunction with other concurrent  experiments to
              quantify the energy brought to the underside of the  ice, will form the basis
              of a regional study of the processes  responsible for the relatively thick
              upper mixed layer and thin ice  cover.  It is believed that these conditions
              are only marginally  stable, and are maintained by a relatively high upward
              heat flux,  which, if interrupted, could lead to deep vertical convection, and 
              a significant change in the oceanic climate.  ***
