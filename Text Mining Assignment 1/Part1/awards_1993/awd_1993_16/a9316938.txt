              proteins flavodoxin and eglin c, basic aspects of protein mobility will be
              studied.  The research will be based on         ? x     heteronuclear
              relaxation experiments of    15   N and    13   C and on         ? @    
              homonuclear nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements.  Fully    15   N     
                 ?       or    13   C labeled proteins as well as 7 10%    13   C labeled
              proteins will be used for the studies. While conventional methods of studying
              protein structures yield static (rigid) models, this research focuses on the
              motions within the structural framework of biological macromolecules.  The
              technology can be transferred to proteins that are targets for rational drug
              design.  There it is generally important to know about the mobility vs.
              apparent rigidity of surface areas.  Studies of side chain mobility may be
              particularly important for this aspect. %%% Structure, mobility and structural
              disorder are important aspects of protein function, and protein target
              recognition.  This will be studied with the ada protein, a DNA repair protein,
              a flavodoxin from Anacystis nidulans and the elastase inhibitor eglin c.  The
              ada protein repai rs methylated DNA preventing transcription and replication
              artifacts.  After demethylating DNA phosphate groups it undergoes a
              conformational change and becomes a transcriptional activator of its own gene. 
              Thus the structure and mobility of free N terminal domains of ada, as well as
              complexes with DNA will be studied.  Since the protein changes conformation
              while pursuing its function, studies of the mobility are expected to shed light
              on the mechanism of protein function. ***
