Abstract    :
              9316082  Marone      The PI will perform experiments to determine the critical
              slip distance, which plays a key role in determining the rupture nucleation
              dimension, the magnitude of the precursive moment release, and the maximum
              seismic ground acceleration.  He will measure this parameter for a wider range
              of materials, normal stresses, and slip rates than previous studies, will
              investigate in detail the frictional behavior and constitutive parameters for
              shear within  fractally-rough surfaces, and will systematically model the data
              collected.  In this way, he will develop an understanding of the underlying
              mechanics and physical processes, and investigate how these mechanics and
              processes relate to those operative in natural fault zones.  ****
