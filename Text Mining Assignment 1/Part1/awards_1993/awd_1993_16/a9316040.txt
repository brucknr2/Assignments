Abstract    :
              9316040 Gorelick  Understanding and describing subsurface heterogeneity is an
              important problem in hydrology.  Typically, data are sparse and yet aquifers
              have properties that vary tremendously in space.  By simultaneously using
              different tyes of data to delineate aquifer heterogeneities and determine
              hydraulic parameter values, maps of aquifer properties can be determined that
              are far more accurate than maps developed based on analysis of each type of
              data by itself.  In fact, individual analysis of data sets may lead to maps of
              aquifer properties that are inconsistent with each other.  In order to develop
              a consistent imate of spatially variable aquifer properties we propose to
              develop a coupled approach in which cross well seismic tomography is combined
              with hydraulic head data and solute tracer data.  Measurements from the three
              independently collected data sets are incorporated into the inverse method
              through numerical solutions to the equations governing seismic wave
              propagation, groundwater flow, and solute transport.  We match simulated values
              to measured values using a "coupled model" inverse approach.  Two pilot studies
              are presented to indicate the logical starting point for this proposed research
              effort.  We will develop two estimation approaches for aquifer property
              delineation and apply them to the Savannah River Site, which is well
              characterized.  Cross well seismic traveltime data, tracer test data, and
              hydraulic head data have all been collected at this site.  A unified approach
              will be developed based upon the relative success of our two approaches.
