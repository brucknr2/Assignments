Abstract    :
              9316509  Whillans  This award is for support for a three year program to study
              the  mass balance and ice stream mechanics in West Antarctica.  This  study
              will use recently collected data to further test and refine  models for
              mechanical control on the ice streams and will refine  mass balance
              calculations of the ice stream B drainage system.  The  first calculations of
              mass balance for ice stream D and E will also  be made and an explanation will
              be sought for what appear to be  stranded old shear margins within the ice
              streams.  This work will  lead to a better understanding of the reasons for the
              existence of  the ice streams and the mechanisms that control their movement.  
              Because changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet have direct impacts  on global
              sea level it is important to understand both the past and  present controls on
              the ice streams so as to predict their future  course.  ***
