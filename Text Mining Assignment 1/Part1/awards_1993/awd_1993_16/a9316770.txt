Abstract    :
              9316770  Faulds       Accommodation zones facilitate reversals in both the dip 
              directions of normal fault systems and tilt directions of fault  blocks and
              this coordinate the large-scale segmentation of  continental rifts.  This study
              will investigate accommodation zones  that trend perpendicular to the extension
              direction, termed  interference accommodation zones.  The study will utilize
              exposures  in the northern part of the Colorado River extensional corridor.  
              Results will help define the three-dimensional geometry and  kinematic
              evolution of interference accommodation zones.
