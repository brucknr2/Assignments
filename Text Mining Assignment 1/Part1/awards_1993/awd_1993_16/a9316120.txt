Abstract    :
              9316120  King      The current generation of convection calculations indicate
              that including the effect of the spinel to perovskite plus magnesiowustite
              phase change in the convective flow calculation causes complex time-dependent
              flow patterns in the Rayleigh number range appropriate to the Earth.  This
              so-called "dynamic layering" phenomenon will be investigated in a 2-D Cartesian
              geometry with a compressible finite element code.  The PI will compare the
              simple thermodynamical formulation used in previous studies with a
              thermodynamically self-consistent formulation.  He will then investigate the
              effect of temperature-dependent viscosity with plate-like and slab-like
              features in the compressible, phase change system.  He will evaluate the
              results using radial mass flux functions and radial correlation functions.
