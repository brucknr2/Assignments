              Studies (BITS 2)  Chronic undersampling of the marine environment, including
              both biological and physical components has been, and remains, a major block to
              understanding how the marine ecosystem functions and how it will respond to
              changes, whether natural or anthropogenic.  This research directly addresses
              this problem by applying advanced acoustical technology to the problem of
              measuring spatial distributions of zooplankton and micronekton at a mooring,
              and collecting abundance and size data with a high temporal resolution over
              long periods.  There are three specific objectives of this research:  1) 
              operation and maintenance of a recently installed pilot mooring on the Southern
              California coast, 2) development of a vertical profiling platform to allow
              collection of long time records with high resolution of vertical fine structure
              in the plankton and related biophysical variables, and 3) deployment and
              installation of a mooring for studying zooplankton in the northwest Atlantic on
              Georges Bank as part of GLOBEC, a component of the US Global and Climate Change
              initiative.
