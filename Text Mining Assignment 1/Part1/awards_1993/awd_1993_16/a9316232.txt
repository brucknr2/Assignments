Abstract    :
              9316232  Kohl   This interagency transfer to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
              provides cost sharing for the fourth in a series of joint  oceanographic
              expeditions under the U.S.-Russia Environmental  Agreement.   The 1993
              expedition will involve U.S. scientists from  several institutions and
              scientists from Russia's Institute of  Global Climate and Ecology in Moscow. 
              The expedition will focus on  the biogeochemical cycles of contaminants,
              related oceanographic  processes, food-web interactions in North Pacific waters
              flowing  through the area, and behavior of organic pollutants at the 
              water/sediment interface.  Geographic areas of study will range  from the
              continental shelves of the Bering and Chukchi Seas to the  deep Bering Sea. 
              Intensive biological sampling locations will  include several long-term
              monitoring sites (polygons) that have  been visited four times since 1977.  The
              Russian-American research  is comprehensive and highly integrated  and the data
              will be of  interest to the Divisions of Ocean Sciences and Polar Programs.
