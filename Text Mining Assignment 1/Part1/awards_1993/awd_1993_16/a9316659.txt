Abstract    :
              9316659  Maurasse       The Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary beds in the
              Southern  Peninsula of Haiti are of special interest because of the 
              stratigraphic continuity of the sequences, and because structures  in the
              marker beds may offer succession of events that will allow  for the
              characterization of oceanic disturbances that affected the  deep basin of the
              Caribbean Sea.  Our most recent investigation of  an extended area of the Beloc
              Formation suggest that different  outcrops in the area may provide key
              lithologic and  biostratigraphic data necessary to determine whether or not the
               disruptive phenomenon recorded at the boundary is single or  multiple.       
              Although the genesis of the marker beds is unresolved,  preliminary correlation
              of diverse sequences in the area suggests  that some of the structures are
              caused by extraordinary waves of  translation in deep water rather than from
              turbidity currents.  The  hypothesis of such giant waves is compatible with
              predicted models  of potential disturbances expected to take place in the water
               column in conjunction with an oceanic target site (Gault and  Sonett, 1982;
              O'Keefe and Ahrens, 1982; Ahrens and O'keefe, 1983;  Sonett et al., 1991).     
               This project will focus specifically on the detailed analysis  of amalgamated
              beds that show physical evidence of poorly  understood oceanic disturbances
              recorded in the transitional series  at several additional locations in the
              Peninsula.       The results will provide additional data to:  1) further 
              characterize the oceanic disturbances(s) that led to the genesis of  reworked
              marker beds in deep-water basins; 2) find a viable  solution for unexplained
              fossil mixing in deep-ocean basins  observed worldwide at the K/T boundary; 3)
              better understand the  magnitude of oceanic mixing that could have been caused
              by an  impact.
