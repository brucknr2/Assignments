Abstract    :
              9316306  Kellogg  This award is for support of a one year systematic study of
              Diatoms  and other biogenic micropraticles in the McMurdo Dome ice core,  which
              is being drilled during the austral summer 1993/94.  The  identity and
              provenance of the species (marine vs. non-marine and  Antarctic endemic or
              cosmopolitan) should give some indication of  the closest and most likely
              sources for biogenic particles.  Down-  core fluctuations in numbers and
              identity of Diatoms may record  changes in wind strength and/or direction.  The
              Diatom record is  expected to provide an additional tool for linking the paleo-
               climatic history of the Ross Sea and ice-free areas of Southern  Victoria Land
              with that of the East and West Antarctic ice sheets.  ***
