Abstract    :
              This research aims to address the validity of octanol-water partition
              measurements as a basis for estimating the toxicity and distribution of certain
              pollutants between biota and surrounding aqueous environment.  Sorption of
              chlorinated aryl alcohols, products of paper manufacture, onto liposomes is
              proposed for a more representative model of biological tissues.  Measurements
              will be made as a function of concentration, pH and salt concentration. 
              Results for ionized and un-ionized species will be determined and compared with
              the octanol-water partition coefficients.  Discrepancies of acid dissociation
              constants between the sorbed and free toxins is to be examined.    Results from
              this research will be helpful in determining the fate of pollutants, estimating
              toxicity levels, and in evaluating the use of biomass for the removal of these
              types of pollutants.
