Abstract    :
              9316053  Girgis  This proposal is for partial support for travel to the 11th
              Power  System Computation Conference (PSCC).  This year the conference  will be
              held in Avignon, France, from August 30 to September 3.   Since its inception
              in 1963, PSCC has evolved to become the  leading international conference
              outside of the U.S. in the area  of power systems applications, and attracts
              key people from  around the world.  This year the conference will offer two
              panel  sessions on very timely topics as well as over 150 technical  papers
              over a wide range of current interests.  ***
