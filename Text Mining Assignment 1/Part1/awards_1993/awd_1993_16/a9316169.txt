Abstract    :
              9316169  Bird       This project will utilize a large data base on faults, 
              displacements, rotations and stress directions for further  developing improved
              models for the evolution of North America since  85 Ma.  These data will be
              reduced to tables with attached  references, uncertainties and digitised map
              locations and will be  the basis for a number of finite elements models, so as
              to  constrain a number of important variables such as selection of the  most
              appropriate rheology for the lithosphere and the accurate  closure of the plate
              loop to model the gradual formation of the San  Andreas transform during the
              Neogene.  Results will provide a  detailed forward model of the development of
              North America during  the Cenozoic.
