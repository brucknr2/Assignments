Abstract    :
              9316215  Jansma      The PI will participate in a collaborative research program
              to investigate the rate and direction of motion of the Caribbean and North
              American plates, as well as the intervening geologic terrains in the northeast
              Caribbean.  The PI and collaborators will reoccupy the sites previously
              occupied in 1986, and analyze their new data to determine plate and microplate
              motions during the intervening years.  In this way they will obtain new
              information relating to the driving forces for plate motions, changes in local
              continental margins and associated sea-level changes, strain partitioning
              between the plates and microplates, fault slip rates, and seismic hazard along
              the major fault zones.  ****
