Abstract    :
              This award supports a study of molluscan fossils across the  Cretaceous-Tertiary
              boundary on Seymour Island in the Antarctica  Peninsula.  Seymour Island
              contains rich and well preserved faunal  and floral assemblages in a thick
              stratigraphic section that  encompasses the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, a
              time of well  documented extinction in other parts of the world.  Previous work
               has yielded a rich molluscan fauna but additional work is needed to 
              understand and correlate the biostratigraphy and sedimentology  immediately
              above and below the Cretaceous-Tertiary transition.   This work will attempt to
              recover fossils and examine the  sedimentology on a centimeter sampling scale
              from 5 meters below to  5 meters above the boundary.  These fossils, in
              conjunction with  sedimentologic analysis of the measured section, will allow a
               determination of the continuity of the boundary section and will  also allow
              an attempt at high resolution analysis of the molluscan  faunal changes.  This
              study will lead to an improved understanding  of molluscan changes at the
              Cretaceous-Tertiary transition in high  southern latitudes and the relation of
              these changes to Cretaceous-  Tertiary extinction elsewhere.
