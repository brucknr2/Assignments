Abstract    :
              9316479  Opdyke       Considerable progress has been made in understanding the 
              various collisions between major blocks of China, however  uncertainty still
              exists about the timing of collisions between the  North China Block, the South
              China Block and the Indochina Block  during the Mesozoic due to
              remagnetization.  This work will study  Middle Triassic rocks from three
              localities where preliminary  paleomagnetic data suggest a promise of primary
              magnetization.   Results will shed light on the Mesozoic remagnetization place 
              constraints on the timing of block collision and help to fit China  into the
              global Mesozoic plate loop.
