                    ABSTRACT    P.I.  Kenneth Rose/Maureen O'Leary   SBR-9316019   
              Paleontologists have always hoped the study of fossil teeth would reveal the
              diet, ecological adaptations, as well as the evolutionary relationships, of 
              living and extinct vertebrates.     This study, using SEM molar microwear
              analysis to infer diet, and also landmark-based and outline-based morphometrics
              of the teeth, will reveal how dental form and use changed over a substantial
              time interval in an important extinct primate group.  Also, paleosol data from
              this early Eocene sequence in Wyoming suggests that variation there can be tied
              to the dental microwear and morphological changes, which would be a
              break-through.      The project will contribute to the study of the tempo and
              mode of evolutionary change in these primates.  It will also train a very
              competent young researcher in an excellent program.   ***
