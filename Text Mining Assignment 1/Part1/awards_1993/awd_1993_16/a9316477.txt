Abstract    :
              9316477  Wolff  The proposed research project will exploit the measurable 
              evolution of  87Sr/86Sr  over the lifetime of a large  rhyolitic magma system
              with very high Rb/Sr, to investigate  and constrain the rates and nature of
              processes causing  compositional zonation.  The rhyolitic system to be studied 
              is that which erupted at 1.51 Ma to form the Otowi (or  Lower) Member of the
              Bandelier Tuff, Jemez Mountains, New  Mexico.  The procedure to be followed
              relies on analyzing  very small amounts of Sr (down to 1 ng) in small samples
              of  feldspar, matrix glass, and glass inclusions.  The results  of this work
              will enable the contribution of various  processes involved in compositional
              zonation (closed-system  differentiation, phenocrysts accumulation, wall-rock 
              contamination, magmatic recharge) of the Otowi Member magma  to be quantified. 
              More significantly, the timing, rates,  and mechanism of any contribution from
              closed-system  differentiation can be constrained more closely than is 
              possible in a conventional geochemical  study.
