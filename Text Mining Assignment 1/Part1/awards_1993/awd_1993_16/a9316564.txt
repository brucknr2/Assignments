Abstract    :
              9316564  Mayewski  This award is for support for a three year program to provide
              a high resolution record of the Antarctic  climate through the acquisition,
              analysis, and interpretation of records of atmospheric chemical  deposition
              taken from three ice cores located at sites within or immediately adjacent to
              the Ross Ice  Drainage System (RIDS).  These cores include one from Taylor
              Dome, and two from West Antarctic  locations identified as potential deep
              drilling sites for the WAISCORES program.    Collection of the  two West
              Antarctic cores is intended to be a lightweight dry-drilling operation to
              depths of ~ 200 m,  which will provide records of > 2 kyr.    Glaciochemical
              analyses will focus on the major cations and  anions found in the antarctic
              atmosphere, plus methanesulfonic acid and selected measurements of the 
              hydrogen ion, aluminum, iron, and silica.  These analyses, and companion stable
              isotope and particle  measurements to be carried out by other investigators
              require < 7% by volume of each core, leaving >  90% for other investigators and
              storage at the U.S. National Ice Core Laboratory.  These records are  intended
              to solve a variety of scientific objectives while also providing spatial
              sampling and  reconnaissance for future U.S. efforts in West Antarctica.  ***
