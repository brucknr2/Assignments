Abstract    :
              9316651  Morrison       Recent studies have indicated that meteoric water may
              have  penetrated to depths as great as 16 km in the zone of mylonitic 
              deformation of the Whipple Mountain metamorphic core complex area.   However,
              the existing oxygen depletion data can be interpreted to  be due to either 1)
              post mylonitization meteoric water exchange  related to brittle detachment
              faulting, syn-mylonitic exchange with  meteoric water which penetrated downward
              into the ductile regime or  3) fluid-rock exchange in the lower plate at the
              transition between  the brittle and ductile regimes.  This continued project
              will  produce oxygen and hydrogen isotopic analyses of mineral separates  in
              well characterized samples with distinct deformational  histories.  Results
              will help discriminate between the  possibilities and place constraints on the
              role of fluids in the  development of the Whipple Mountain metamorphic core
              complex.
