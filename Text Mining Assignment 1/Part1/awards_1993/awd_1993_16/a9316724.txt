Abstract    :
              9316724  Gilmore  The demonstration that DNA was the principle that transformed 
              Streptococcus pneumoniae from rough to smooth colony type is  broadly viewed as
              the event that launched the era of molecular  genetics, the cornerstone of
              modern biotechnology.  Streptococcal  genetics have continued to be at the
              forefront in developing  biotechnologies for application in manufacturing, such
              as dairy,  meat, and silage fermentation industries; the production of novel 
              streptokinases in the pharmaceutical industry; and for determining  the
              structure and function of numerous virulence factors in human  and veterinary
              disease.  Investigators from these diverse fields  who have made major
              contributions to the rich history of  streptococcal genetics, as well as young
              aspiring investigators  from across the globe will be brought together in Sante
              Fe, NM, for  the Fourth International ASM Symposium on Streptococcal Genetics. 
               Funds obtained from NSF will be used to support travel,  registration, and
              meeting expenses for students, post-doctoral  fellows, and speakers addressing
              central issues on the basic  genetics of streptococci, lactococci and
              enterococci.  ***
