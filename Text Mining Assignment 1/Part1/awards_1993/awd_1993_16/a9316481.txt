Abstract    :
              9316481  Bilham      This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of
              a  gravity meter capable of measuring absolute gravity with a  precision of 1
              microgal.  The instrument will be purchased by the  University of Colorado and
              made available in a multi-user facility  for the U.S. geophysics research
              community through a memorandum of  understanding with the National Oceanic and
              Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) which will house, calibrate and repair it
              and  provide a field engineer during field deployment.    The instrument will
              be used primarily in studies of global sea  level, mountain building, crustal
              deformation, earthquakes, and the  detection of underground movement of water
              and magma.  ***
