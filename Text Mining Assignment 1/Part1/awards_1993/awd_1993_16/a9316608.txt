Abstract    :
              9316608  Lasaga  This award will support continuing theoretical and 
              experimental work on the atomic descriptions of geochemical  processes and the
              development of kinetic theory in  geochemistry and petrology.   The research
              will continue the  task of obtaining high quality quantum mechanical 
              information on bonding in important geochemical gas  molecules, silicates,
              aluminosilicates and other minerals.  The quantum mechanical results will be
              incorporated into  potential energy functions, which are then employed in 
              kinetic studies of reaction rates, estimates of kinetic  isotopic effects,
              molecular dynamics and monte carlo  simulations.  These studies will elucidate
              the relationship  between atomic physics and macroscopic thermodynamic and 
              kinetic phenomena of interest to earth scientists.
