Abstract    :
              9316902  Irving       This award provides 54% of the funding required for the 
              acquisition of an equipment upgrade to the chemical analysis  facility in the
              Department of Geological Sciences at the University  of Washington. A new
              inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer  (ICP-MS) unit, as well as
              modernization of a used inductively-  coupled atomic emission spectrometer
              (ICP-AES) will enhance the  department's ability to analyze the content of
              rocks, minerals,  soils, and other samples for diagnostic trace elements.
              Several  department faculty members are involved in basic research projects 
              for which the capabilities made possible by this upgrade are  essential. The
              University of Washington is committed to providing  the remaining funds needed
              for the project.  ***
