Abstract    :
              9316888  Becker      This award supports participation of five US mathematics
              educators  in a joint US-China-Japan seminar on mathematical problem solving.  
              The seminar will be held in China in October 1993. Papers and  discussion at
              the seminar will deal with the present states of  problem solving research in
              the three countries: comparison of  student performance in problems solving,
              including word problems  and language factors; mathematical model making in
              problem solving;  students' consciousness of the processes which are used in
              solving  problems and arriving at solutions; pre and in-service teacher 
              education; assessment and evaluation of learning in  teaching/learning problem
              solving; technology use in problem  solving; and analyses of the goals of
              mathematics education when  emphasis is placed on problem solving and
              technology use.  Factors  and issues that promote educational achievement in
              problem solving  will be identified.    This seminar holds promise for
              advancement of knowledge since  Japanese and Chinese researchers have strong
              interests in problem  solving research, and have produced important work in the
              area.   The noted success of the educational systems in Japan and Asia will  be
              explored in the area of math education, providing a basis for  future
              collaboration and exchange of research findings.
