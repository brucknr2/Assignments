Abstract    :
              9316334  Crespi       This Research Planning Grant will initiate a
              regional-scale  study of strain history partitioning in the Taconic Allochthon
              of  western New England.  Field studies will focus on orientation  analysis of
              cleavage, bedding and veins, and collection of samples.   Laboratory analysis
              will include microstructural study of the veins  ad pressure-fringes around
              pyrite crystals to establish the degree  of partitioning of strain into coaxial
              and non-coaxial components.   The results will test the feasibility of the area
              and methods a  larger- scale project to investigate strain partitioning in the 
              northern Appalachians orogenic belt.
