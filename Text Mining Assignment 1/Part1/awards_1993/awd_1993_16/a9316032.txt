Abstract    :
              9316032  Jordan     This research is to calculate properties of mantle flow that
              can  be tested by means of global seismic data.  2-D and 3-D numerical 
              experiments will be done to catalog the types of flow models  consistent with
              the observed radial correlation function, as well  as other diagnostics. 
              Important parameters include the viscosity  profile and the amount of internal
              heating.  Seismic modeling will  be directed at two topics.  1) Data sets for
              determining 3-D mantle  structure will be improved by the development of
              multi-mode  estimation techniques for extracting the parameters that describe 
              free-oscillation multiplets split by aspherical heterogeneity.  2)  The
              seismological inverse problem will be reformulated in terms of  a two-point
              correlation function, a stochastic approach where the  angular integrations are
              replaced by averages over products between  pairs of data points.  ***
