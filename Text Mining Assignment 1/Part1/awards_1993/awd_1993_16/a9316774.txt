Abstract    :
                                          Abstract    9316774  Deshler  This project is a
              continuation and expansion on earlier research,  to study the causes and nature
              of the annual Antarctic ozone hole.   Balloon borne sensors will be flown from
              McMurdo, Antarctica to  measure vertical profiles of ozone, aerosols, polar
              stratospheric  clouds and, in collaboration with other researchers using the
              same  balloons, water vapor, nitric acid vapor and aerosols remotely  sensed by
              a small lidar.  The researchers will also work closely  with a ground based
              Italian lidar group.  The chemistry and  physical conditions which will be
              studied all play a crucial role  in the formation of the ozone hole.      The
              balloon flights in the first year (1994) will be coordinated  with a NASA
              sponsored ER-2 aircraft mission which will be flown  from Christchurch, NZ to
              Antarctica.    This project supports the Global Change Initiative.  ***
