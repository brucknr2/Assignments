Abstract    :
              9316721  Altaner    This award will support collaborative research between
              Stephen  Altaner, University of Illinois, and Antonio Pozzuoli of the 
              University of Naples, Italy.  The proposed research has two  general
              objectives:  1) Improved understanding of the mechanism  of the smectite to
              illite reaction through study of a suite of  illite- and smectite-bearing
              samples from Ponza island, Italy,  and 2) assessment of the nature of
              hydrothermal alteration of the  Green Tuff and overlying breccia of Ischia
              (Italy), designed to  lead to improved evaluation of volcanic risk on Ischia.  
               Professor Pozzuoli is a specialist in the mineralogy and  petrology of clay
              minerals, particularly those of the Ponza  bentonite.  He and his colleagues
              are also experts in the geology  of Ponza and Ischia, critical to the
              collection of appropriate  samples.  Professor Altaner and his colleagues bring
              to the  collaboration expertise and facilities for integrated state-of- 
              the-art analyses of geologic samples, including K/Ar dating, NMR,  oxygen
              isotope geochemistry, XRD, and TEM analyses.  ***
