Abstract    :
              9316157  Rafailovich    Recently, several research groups have demonstrated that
              due to the  large entropy associated with confining long polymer molecules at 
              interfaces, the classical wetting theories developed for simple  liquids do not
              apply.  I order to obtain a better understanding of  the wetting properties of
              polymer films we are employing a variety  of complementary techniques (SIMS,
              reflectivity, TEM, and AFM) to  conduct an three-fold program.  1) Wetting
              properties of thin  liquid polymer films:  We are exploring the role of the
              chain  dimensions on the film stability, surface diffusion, glass  transition,
              wetting of rough surfaces, and total density.   Modification of mean-field
              theories to include new experimental  phenomena are being developed.  2)
              Surface modification via end-  functionalized polymers:  The conformations of
              end-grafted polymers  are being studied both in melts and solutions under
              steady-state  shear.  The in-plane structure of brushes is being studied and 
              compared with theoretical simulations.  3) Surface induced ordering  of
              triblock copolymers:  Triblock copolymers have the unique  ability to form
              surface-induced micelle gel films.  We are studying  the penetration and
              wetting of homopolymer films on these gel  surfaces as a function of the
              relative molecular weights of the two  components and the interaction energies
              with the ordering surface.    Very thin polymer films are known to have a large
              variety of  applications such as lubricants, coatings for optical and 
              electronic components, and adhesives.  In order for these films to  be
              effective, they must wet the surfaces upon which they are spread  or penetrate
              through the interfaces to provide adhesive strength.  ***
