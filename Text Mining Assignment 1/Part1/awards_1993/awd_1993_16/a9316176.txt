Abstract    :
              9316176  Yin       Although the Indo-Asia collision is believed to be
              responsible  for the Tibetan plateau, the role of pre-collisional crustal 
              shortening information of the Tibetan plateau remains poorly  defined, but may
              be present due to the existing of pre-collisional  folds and thrusts.  A
              reconnaissance investigation indicated such  features are extensive, and this
              project is designed to conduct  detailed field mapping and thermochronological
              studies to further  describe the pre-collisional deformation and assess to what
              extent  they were responsible for pre-collision thickening of the crust.  ***
