Abstract    :
              9316495  Carmichael       This award provides 71% of the funding necessary for 
              the acquisition of a new electron microprobe that will be  installed and
              operated in the Department of Geology and  Geophysics at the University of
              California-Berkeley. The  University is committed to providing the remaining
              funds  necessary to acquire this instrument.       The electron microprobe is a
              versatile electron beam  instrument capable of accurate analysis of chemical 
              composition of solids for major element  constituents to  trace elements and
              has an analytical spatial resolution on  the sample target of a micrometer. The
              new UC-Berkeley  electron microprobe will be primarily used by research  groups
              in the Department of Geology and Geophysics, the  Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
              other campus and off-campus  groups with research needs for microanalysis of
              solids.  ***
