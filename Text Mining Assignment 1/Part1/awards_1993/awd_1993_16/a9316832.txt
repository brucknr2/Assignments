Abstract    :
                          9316832  Schnable  The composition of the cuticular wax of plants is
              complex and  incompletely known, and little is known regarding the biosynthesis
               of this material(s).  The glossy8 locus, one of the seventeen loci  known to
              be involved in the biosynthesis of this wax in maize, has  been molecularly
              cloned by tagging with a transposable element.  In  addition, the cer2 locus of
              Arabidopsis, which is involved in  cuticular wax biosynthesis, has been
              localized to a 70-kb segment  of the genome.  The cer2 locus will be identified
              by genetic  complementation tests.  Both genes will then be used to study the 
              biochemical and genetic mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of  these
              unique and biologically significant plant lipids.    The cuticular waxes of
              plants constitute the first barrier to the  environment and the stresses it
              imposes on plants.  Thus, these  waxes lay an important role in plant survival.
               The composition of  these waxes and the biosynthetic pathways by which they
              are formed  are incompletely understood.  This project will make use of 
              molecularly cloned genes to examine the gene products of the  biosynthetic
              pathway and thus enlarge our understanding of it.    ***
