Abstract    :
              McClung  9316662  Rhythmic biological phenomena which recur at approximately 24
              hour  intervals in the absence of environmental time cues are termed  circadian
              rhythms, and their timing is regulated by an endogenous  biological clock. The
              molecular basis of circadian rhythmicity is  not understood in any biological
              system. Our study of such rhythms  in Arabidopsis thalania will be continued
              by, 1) Investigating the  ontogeny of the circadian clock and of the role of
              light in the  induction and phasing of circadian rhythmicity in seedlings. 2) 
              Identification and analysis of mutants with altered clock  properties
              (specifically, altered period length) using a screen  based on the circadian
              resistance to sulfur dioxide exposure  conferred by the circadian rhythm in
              stomatal aperture and 3) The  analysis of the circadian regulation of RCA
              transcription, a gene  involved in carbon assimilation.  %%%  The experiments
              to be done are designed to elucidate the molecular  basis by which time
              information is generated by the biological  clock and used to regulate plant
              gene expression. The circadian  clock regulates the expression of a number of
              Arabidopsis genes,  including genes involved in light harvesting, in carbon 
              assimilation, in photorespiration and in nitrogen assimilation. The 
              interaction between the circadian clock and light indicate that any  complete
              understanding of plant response to environmental stimuli,  such as light level
              and light-dark regimen, must include an  understanding for the endogenous
              capacity of plants to measure  time.  ***
