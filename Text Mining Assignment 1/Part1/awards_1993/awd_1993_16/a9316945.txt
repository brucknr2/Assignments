Abstract    :
              9316945  Bickford       The Grenville province is the youngest precambrian
              province in  North America and is extensive but variably exposed along the 
              Atlantic coast and extends into Texas and Mexico.  This proposal  will
              investigate a key area of exposure near Van Horn Texas where  prior work has
              shown a gradation from lower amphibolite grade upper  crustal rocks in the
              tectonic hinterland to pristine  unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks. The work
              will involve extensive  age dating to constrain deformational events within the
              existing  geologic framework and will develop models for the evolution of the 
              Grenville terrane in this area.  Results will apply to the  generation of the
              1.5-1.35Ga "Anorogenic" granite-rhyolite province  of the central United States
              and to hypotheses of a late  proterozoic connection between Southern North
              America and adjacent  continents.
