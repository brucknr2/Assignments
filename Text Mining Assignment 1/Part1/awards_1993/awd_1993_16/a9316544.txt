Abstract    :
              9316544  Brown    The objective of this project is to investigate the behavior
              of the Earth's magnetic field during  a transition from reversed to normal
              polarity.  Recently a sequence of lavas yielding transitional  paleomagnetic
              directions was discovered as part of a larger interdisciplinary study of Volcan
               Tatara-San Pedro in the central Chilean Andes.  Subsequent radiometric dating,
              using both  traditional K-Ar and laser 40/39 Ar techniques, has identified the
              rocks as being 780,000 years  old, the age of the Brunhes-Matuyama (B-M)
              reversal.  Virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) from  these eleven flows cluster
              around Australia - Southeast Asia.  This detailed study of a Southern 
              Hemisphere reversal record (only the third B-M identified in volcanic rocks)
              will provide  important data for preferred paths and clustered VGP analyses.
