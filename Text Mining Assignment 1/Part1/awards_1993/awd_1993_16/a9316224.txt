Abstract    :
              9316224  Coe       This award provides one-half the funding needed for the 
              acquisition of equipment to measure the magnetic properties of  rocks and
              minerals. The equipment includes an alternating gradient  magnetometer, a Curie
              point balance, a spinner magnetometer, and a  magnetic susceptibility bridge.
              It will be installed and operated  in the University of California at Santa
              Cruz's Paleomagnetism  Laboratory. The institution is committed to providing
              the remaining  funds necessary for the purchase of the equipment.       The
              University of California-Santa Cruz Paleomagnetism  Laboratory is engaged in a
              broad range of research applications of  paleomagnetism that include:
              interpretation of past tectonic plate  motion inferred from a study of the
              direction of magnetization of  rocks, sequence of paleoclimate and
              paleoceanographic events from  application of the magnetic reversal time scale,
              and measurements  of direction and intensity of ancient magnetic fields to
              better  understand the fundamental mechanism by which the Earth's magnetic 
              field is generated. These and related studies will make use of the  new
              equipment.  ***
