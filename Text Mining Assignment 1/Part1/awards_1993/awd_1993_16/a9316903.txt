              grant to acquire research equipment dedicated primarily to dynamic experiments
              by (1) replacement of the current VAXII with a 4 Mb memory by a SUN SPARC
              System (SIOGX 30 325) with a 32 Mb memory, (2) enhancement of the disk capacity
              from 480 Mb to 5200 Mb, (3) improvement of the accelerometer filters to enable
              acquisition of reliable data at high (30 Hz and above) frequencies, (4)
              purchase of state of the art optical transducers to facilitate instrumentation
              for displacement, and (5) acquisition of hardware and software to accelerate
              and improve presentation of acquired data.  These research equipment to be
              acquired are essential to maintain the seismic experimental research capability
              at the University of Illinois at a high, productive level. ***
