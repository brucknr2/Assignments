Abstract    :
              9316103  Molnar         This project involves a multi-disciplinary study of 
              intracontinental deformation in the Tien Shan mountains in  Kyrgystan and
              Khazakhstan which is aimed at testing the connection  or degree of coupling
              between the brittle upper crustal deformation  and mantle dynamics.  To this
              end the principal investigators plan  to collect data on both the kinematics of
              the upper crust and the  deep structure.  Both instantaneous (earthquake and
              GPS  measurements) and Cenozoic deformation will be constrained to  compare
              with lower crust and upper mantle structure (from seismic  and magnetotelluric
              measurements).    The principal investigators have decided to adopt a phased
              approach  to the study in order to answer some preliminary questions about 
              field conditions and data availability which might have a bearing  on the
              design of the full experiment.  The first phase will consist  of a combined
              field trip/workshop in the summer of 1994.   Information gathered during this
              workshop/field trip will be  valuable in its own right and will be invaluable
              in the design of  future studies of this region.   ***
