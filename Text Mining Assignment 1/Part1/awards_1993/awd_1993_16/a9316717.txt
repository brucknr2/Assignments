Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Andrew Hill/ Xingbin Chen  SBR-9316717    This project
              involves an application of a high-level engineering method, Finite Element
              Method, to an investigation of the biomechanical and material properties of the
              chewing system in humans and apes.  This system is extremely complex, yet this
              non-destructive technique has all the potential to shed light on the mechanical
              adaptations of the mandible, and also the factors that may have shaped its
              morphological changes during the course of our recent evolution.    The
              graduate student is already very well trained in both engineering and
              anthropology, and will become a leading researcher in this area as a result of
              this support.  The work may well have clinical implications in dentistry at
              some future date.  ***  P\anthro\jfried\9316717.abs
