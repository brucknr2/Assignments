Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to develop and refine analytical  techniques to
              characterize and date volcanic ash, or tephra, that  is often found in ice
              cores from large ice sheets.  Tephras  layers in ice sheets are particularly
              valuable because, if they  are from large eruptions, they form unique
              time-stratigraphic  markers.  The chemistry of the tephra can be used to
              determine  the provenance, or origin, of the material and 40Ar/39Ar dating has 
              potential to provide an absolute age of the layer.  However,  because the
              amount of material in tephra layers is very small,  both in total mass and in
              terms of particle size, it is important  to develop appropriate analytical
              techniques that can  successfully characterize and date small samples. 
              Refinement of  the laser fusion technique for argon extraction prior to
              isotopic  analysis of is a significant challenge.  However, if successful, 
              this work would be a substantial benefit to studies of ice cores  as an
              independent dating tool.  Furthermore, characterization and  dating of tephra
              from ice cores will provide important  information to climate models.
