Abstract    :
              9316513  Shaw                             This research is to study earthquake
              complexity and the physics  that can result in that complexity.  The questions
              bear directly on  where and how often earthquakes occur and on the nature of
              their  damaging motion.  In particular, a class of models is investigated 
              where all of the complexity is generated by a frictional  instability.  Here,
              distributions of interesting quantities are  produced, without distributions of
              any quantities having to be  assumed.  Results from the modeling studies will
              be compared with  laboratory faulting studies and with the real earthquake
              record.   This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard 
              Reduction Program.  ***
