Abstract    :
              9316414  Butler    Reference paleomagnetic pole positions from cratonic masses
              are  required for reconstruction of past plate positions.  Recently  acquired
              data suggests that the paleozoic apparent polar wander  path for Gondwana
              includes a large Mid-Paleozoic loop but the  existence of this loop is
              controversial and the geometry of the  path is undetermined.  Attendant
              uncertainties in global positions  and motions of Gondwana hamper
              interpretations of which Paleozoic  orogenic events resulted from
              continent-continent collision;  limit  the ability to understand
              paleogeographic origins and subsequent  motion history of accreted terranes;
              and even compromise modeling  of climate change during earth history.  This
              project addresses  this situation and involves a paleomagnetic investigation of
              the  cratonal mid-Paleozoic sequence of the eastern cordillera  in  Bolivia. 
              Successful results will help resolve uncertainty in the  reference apparent
              polar wander path for Gondwana.  ***
