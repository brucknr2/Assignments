Abstract    :
              9316283  DePaolo  The proposed research will develop and test a new approach  to
              using isotopic variations in metamorphic rocks to measure  bulk cation
              diffusivities, rates of metamorphic reactions,  and durations of metamorphic
              conditions.   The objective is  to apply petrological and isotopic tools
              concurrently and  complementarily.  The research comprises two parts: (1) 
              developing numerical codes to simulate one-dimensional  isotopic redistribution
              in layered metamorphic rocks; the  codes are used for generic experiments of
              isotope behavior,  and for modelling in specific field situations, and (2) 
              applying the exchange model to upper amphibolite facies,  garnetiferous
              gneisses of the Tehachapi Mountains, southern  California.
