Abstract    :
              9316282  Mosley-Thompson  This award is for support of a project to conduct
              analyses of the  concentrations and size distributions of the insoluble
              particulates  preserved in the Taylor Dome ice core from East Antarctica.  A 
              combination of high and low resolution sampling is proposed to look  at annual
              to decadal-scale and century-scale variations.  These  analyses represent one
              component of a larger collaborative effort  to compile a long
              (glacial/inter-glacial), multi-parameter paleo-  environmental history for the
              Taylor Dome area.  The record of dust  concentrations within the ice core, in
              conjunction with the other  proxy records to be extracted, will contribute to a
              comprehensive  view of the atmospheric and glaciologic conditions in this
              region.  ***
