Abstract    :
              9316656  Bursik  The primary hypothesis to be tested is that the manner in 
              which elutriated ash clouds (of which 'coignimbrite' ash  clouds are a subset)
              are generated is strongly dependent  upon the interaction of pyroclastic flows
              and surges with  the topography surrounding a volcano.  Our objectives are 
              therefore to understand ash cloud generating mechanisms and  flow and surge
              mechanisms especially as they are affected by  topography.  The proposed
              research will consist of detailed  sedimentological measurements, laboratory
              experiments and  theoretical modeling.  Field work will consist of a novel 
              sampling strategy applied to the 1982 deposits of El Chichon  volcano, Mexico,
              at closely spaced sites lying along  traverse that traverse that parrallel flow
              directions.  The  sampling strategy will yield quantitative data that can be 
              used to test theoretical models of  flow behavior.  Laboratory experiments will
              be conducted in conjunction with  the analysis of the field data and the
              development of  theoretical models to provide constraints on interpretations 
              of field data and validation theory.  The proposed activity  will yield
              increased understanding of the mechanisms through  which ash clouds are
              elutriated from pyroclastic flows and  surges.
