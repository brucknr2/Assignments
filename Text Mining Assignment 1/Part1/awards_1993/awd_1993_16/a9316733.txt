Abstract    :
              9316733  Roecker         This project involves a collaborative investigation of
              the  structure of the crust along the San Andreas fault zone in the  Northern
              Gabilan Range, California.  A principal focus of the  investigation will be the
              collection and analysis of seismic data  from linear and 2-D arrays of PASSCAL
              stations deployed across the  San Andreas fault.  Specific objectives are to
              use the data  collected by the arrays to 1) resolve details of the fault zone 
              structure through forward modeling of travel times and waveforms  and
              tomographic imaging of travel times of various phases (P,S,  converted, etc.)
              from both active and passive sources, 2) use the  improved velocity structures
              to relocate hypocenters to improve the  definition of fault complexity at
              depth, 3) examine anisotropy in  the fault zone through shear wave splitting,
              and 4) determine if  and where trapped modes propagate efficiently within the
              fault  zone.  ***
