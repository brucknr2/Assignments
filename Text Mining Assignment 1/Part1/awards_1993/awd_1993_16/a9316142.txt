Abstract    :
              9316142 Wahl      The Research Grants Program of the Geological Society of
              America is a major source of funding for graduate student research in the earth
              sciences.  Begun in 1933, awards to date have been made to more than 5000
              geoscientists in the total among of nearly five million dollars.  In 1989 the
              Geological Society of America received a three-year grant of $300,000 from the
              Earth Sciences Division of the National Science Foundation.  The grant was
              awarded to increase the amount of funding available to ensure the support of
              more high quality research, to increase substantially the average grant amount
              of each award from the level at that time, and to increase the number of awards
              made to women and minorities in the earth sciences.  GSA will continue to
              administer the program as it has for the past sixty-one years.  All NSF funds
              will go to program awards, with GSA bearing all costs of administration.  Award
              funding will be matched on a two-to-one basis by GSA up to $100,000 per year of
              NSF funding.  Annual reports will show the progress made in meeting the
              objectives of this program.
