Abstract    :
              9316336  Evans      The PI will perform experiments to measure the change of
              porosity and permeability with time in rocks saturated with water at high
              temperature and pressure.  Cracked rock samples will be saturated with fluid
              and heated to 400-600 C at various combinations of fluid and confining
              pressure.  Permeability will be measured before, during and after the
              hydrothermal treatments.  Extensive microstructural analyses will be performed
              to understand the changes of microstructure and pore geometry that occur,
              including measurements of mean values and distributions of crack length, crack
              aperture, and orientation.  Such measurements will show the evolution of the
              pore space, and can be compared with stereological measurements of natural
              samples and samples that have been thermally cracked without pore fluids.  With
              a new apparatus he will measure the evolution of the permeability with time
              while the samples are under hydrothermal conditions.  Some experiments will
              also be done with triaxial loading to test the effects of non-hydrostatic
              stresses.  ****
