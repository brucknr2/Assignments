Abstract    :
              9316595  Monaghan       This award provides one-half the funding required to
              acquire  a low-energy gamma-ray detection and counting system that will be 
              installed and operated by the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurements  Laboratory, or
              PRIME Lab. Purdue University is committed to  providing the remaining funds
              necessary for acquisition of this  equipment system.       The soil samples and
              aerosol particles to be studied with this  system contain radionuclides of
              beryllium, caesium, and lead which  can be used to track aerosol particle
              movements in the atmosphere  and their deposition patterns on the earth's
              surface. The Principal  Investigator and colleagues in PRIME Lab are active in
              research  using these tracers to determine the mechanisms and rates of soil 
              development and mixing of soils on the earth's surface.  ***
