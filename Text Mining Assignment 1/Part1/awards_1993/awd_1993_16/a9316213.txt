Abstract    :
               ABSTRACT  Hoffman, G. Lyle  AST-9316213  Radioastronomical observations and
              analyses will be made to continue a long-term study of how galaxies aggregate
              on various scales from small groups through superclusters, of the nature and
              properties of particular morphological types of galaxies, and physical
              processes affecting the outermost edges of HI disks.  Data from the Arecibo
              Observatory for two samples of galaxies will be analyzed.  Observations of
              faint candidate members of all groups within the declination range of the
              Arecibo telescope will be observed and analyzed to study the extension of the
              Tully-Fisher relation to fainter objects, to obtain even more precise distances
              to the groups, and to investigate the dynamics of the individual groups as well
              as the tidal influences on them produced by the Local Supercluster and more
              distant mass concentrations.  ***
