Abstract    :
              9316160  Booker         This is a project involving the collection of a
              continuous  tensor electromagnetic profile (EMAP) across the San Andreas Fault 
              in central California.  The experiment has the potential to resolve  targets of
              direct relevance to the earthquake process including  high conductivity and
              presumably high pore pressure regions within  the fault zone, resistive and
              hence impermeable membranes between  the fault zone and the country rock and
              enhanced crustal  conductivity below the brittle-ductile transition.  However, 
              detailed investigation of electrical structure within the fault  zone at
              seismogenic depths is likely to require a controlled  electromagnetic source
              deployed in conjunction with a deep drill  hole.  Detailed knowledge of the
              background electrical structure is  a key requirement for design of such an
              experiment and providing  this information is as important as the potential for
              direct  insight from the EMAP data.   ***
