Abstract    :
              9316061     Yuretich         The Baikal Drilling Project is a
              multi-institutional effort to  investigate the paleoclimatic history and
              tectonic evolution of the  Lake Baikal sedimentary basin in the Late Neogene. 
              Recent climate  modelling studies have predicted the pattern of temperature 
              expected for the Baikal region in response to Milankovitch forcing.   Proxy
              climate time series obtained from Baikal sediment cores will  provide essental
              ground truthing for these types of models.  Lake  Baikal occupies the largest
              basin in the Baikal Rift Zone, one of  the two major continental rift zones in
              the world.  Hence, Lake  Baikal provides an opportunity to study the recent
              evolution of an  important tectonic feature.  ***
