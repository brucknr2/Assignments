Abstract    :
                9316528  Kanamori    This research is to study the characteristics of tsunami-
               producing earthquakes to determine the role of sediment subduction  at plate
              margins and the resulting influence on the mechanism of  subduction-zone
              earthquakes.  Detailed investigations of the 1992  Nicaragua earthquake and
              other subduction-zone earthquakes will be  done to determine the source
              characteristics and spectra in  relation to the sediment structure near the
              epicenter of the  respective events.  In addition to traditional seismic
              analysis,  the research will involve use of a newly recognized long-period 
              phase, the W phase, which arrives between the P and S waves.  The  traditional
              tsunami warning system is based on the location and the  magnitude of the
              earthquake.  Unfortunately, because of past  instrumental limitations, the
              traditional system uses 20-second  surface-wave magnitude for warning purposes.
               However, for slow  earthquakes such as the Nicaragua event, the 20-second
              surface-wave  magnitude does not represent the true size of the earthquake.  At
               periods longer than 100 seconds, the tsunami potential would have  been better
              recognized.  This research is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***
