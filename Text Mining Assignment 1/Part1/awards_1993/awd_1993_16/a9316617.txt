Abstract    :
              9316617     King         The Baikal Drilling Project is a multi-institutional
              effort to  investigate the paleoclimatic history and tectonic evolution of the 
              Lake Baikal sedimentary basin in the Late Neogene.  Recent climate  modelling
              studies have predicted the pattern of temperature  expected for the Baikal
              region in response to Milankovitch forcing.   Proxy climate time series
              obtained from Baikal sediment cores will  provide essental ground truthing for
              these types of models.  Lake  Baikal occupies the largest basin in the Baikal
              Rift Zone, one of  the two major continental rift zones in the world.  Hence,
              Lake  Baikal provides an opportunity to study the recent evolution of an 
              important tectonic feature.  ***
