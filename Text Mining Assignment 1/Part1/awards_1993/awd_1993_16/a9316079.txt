Abstract    :
              9316079  Jenkins  This project will examine both macroscopic and microscopic 
              aspects of the substitution of Al into calcic amphiboles in  response to
              variations in the pressure, temperature, and  compositional conditions of
              formation.  Variations in the Al  content of tremolitic amphibole should
              provide a wider data  base for testing and refining the thermodynamic mixing 
              properties of amphiboles in the system H2O-CaO-MgO-Al2O3-  SiO2.  Research on
              Fe-Tschermak's substitution will seek to  quantify the strong correlation
              observed between Fe2+ and Al  and natural calcic amphiboles.  The pressure
              dependency of  the actinolite-hornblende miscibility gap will be  investigated
              by examining the volume-composition  relationships along the join
              tremolite-pargasite, which  serves as an approximation to the
              actinolite-hornblende  "join".  Considerable attention will be devoted to the 
              detailed examination of Al distribution in synthetic  amphiboles by using
              MAS-NMR, IR and XRD Rietveld techniques.  This information will facilitate the
              extraction of  thermochemical mixing properties of Al from available data  on
              calcic amphiboles.
