Abstract    :
              9316538  Smith  Remarkably little is known about the temperature at which 
              pyroclastic particles are transported.  Many factors, other  than the initial
              magma temperature, are known to affect the  emplacement temperature of 
              pyroclastic flows.  these  factors are known, or hypothesized, to be related to
               descriptive and quantifiable textural and structural  characteristics of
              pyroclastic-flow deposits (ignimbrites),  including vesicularity, grain-size
              distribution, grain  morphology, bedding structures, and grading profiles.  In 
              this study, these characteristics will be compared to  emplacement temperatures
              estimated by application of  established rock-magnetism methods to previously
              well-  studied ignimbrites.  The same approach will also be  utilized to
              investigate a pyroclastic-flow deposit that was  the product of a subaerial
              eruption but can be traced from  the subaerial setting to a subaqueous
              depositional  environment.  Establishment of the thermal and textural  changes
              of the deposit that occur in the transition will be  critical to ongoing
              controversy on the nature of such  transitions, which are critical to
              understanding pyroclastic-  flow transport.
