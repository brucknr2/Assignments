Abstract    :
              9316148  Ziegler  In this project of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
               in the Chemistry Divison, Prof. L. Ziegler of Boston University  will extend
              previous studies of ultrafast dynamics in isolated  molecules to the condensed
              phase and clusters, so as to study  the effects of the embedding bath on
              processes in the excited  electronic state of the molecule.  Spontaneous Raman
              and  fluorescence light scattering techniques will be used to 1)  probe the
              time scales, amplitudes and motional character of  solvent/bath descriptions
              and to determine microscopic details  of how these degrees of freedom couple to
              electronic excita-  tions, and 2) how the bath interactions affect the photo- 
              chemical dynamics of the quasi-bound excited state photodisso-  ciation of
              these chromophores.  Well characterized molecules  embedded in clusters,
              solutions, and high pressure gases will  be investigated.  Resonance
              lineshapes, depolarization ratios,  and quantum yields will be measured to
              determine the  vibrational and rotational level dependent dephasing and 
              relaxation rates.    Chemical reactions usually require the elevation of
              molecules  to excited states of energy.  Since the chemistry of molecules 
              under conditions of high pressure, in solution, or embedded in  a solid matrix
              or in a cluster is affected by their  environment, it is important to know and
              understand these  changes in order improve the technology based on chemical 
              reactions.  The research undertaken in this project will  provide a data base
              and theoretical model for the reaction  kinetics and dynamics of well
              characterized molecules which are  embedded in a condensed phase medium.  ***
