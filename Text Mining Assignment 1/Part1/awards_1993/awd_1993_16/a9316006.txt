Abstract    :
              9316006  Johnstone      This award will support the participation of twelve
              senior and  junior investigators to participate in a workshop on  nonparametric
              curve estimation to be held in Canberra, Australia  at the end of June 1994. 
              The American organizer is   Prof. Iain Johnstone of the Department of
              Statistics at Stanford  University. The Australian Co-organizers are Prof.
              Peter Hall and  Dr. Prakash Patil of the Australian National University in 
              Canberra. This workshop is being conducted under the U.S.-  Australia
              Cooperative Science Program and support in Australia  is provided through the
              Department of Industry, Technology and  Regional Development (DITARD).    Curve
              estimation is a vital part of contemporary statistical  methodology. It plays
              an important role in many industrial  applications and in econometrics. The
              workshop will address  new directions in curve estimation by bringing together
              some of  the most active and authoritative workers in the field. The aim  of
              the workshop is to provide a forum for discussing new  developments in the
              subject with a view to determining the most  appropriate new directions for
              future research and the most  promising new methods of data analysis. In
              addition to the  Australian and American participants, statisticians from 
              Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, one from each nation,   will also
              be taking part in this workshop.
