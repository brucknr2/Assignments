Abstract    :
              9316567  Wright  The Wichita granites of the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, a 
              classic illustration of A-type granites intruded in a  continental rift,
              represent an opportunity to develop new  insights into granite sourcing. 
              Limited, new chemical and  isotopic data on the Wichita granites suggest
              derivation by  crystal fractionation of basalt with minor crustal  involvement
              contrary to most previously proposed models.  A  combined chemical and isotopic
              study  of selected granites  from this important group of A-type granites can 
              successfully identify sources and processes involved in A-  type granite
              petrogenesis in crustal rifts.  The Wichita  Granites have already been
              subdivided into three chemical  groups.  Textural, mineralogic, and chemical
              studies of  selected granite sheets, representing the three chemical  groups,
              will clarify these suites.  Combining geochemical  data with isotopic data will
              allow us to see through  fractionation effects in order to characterize
              sources.  Geochronological studies of zircon and titanite should  define
              crystallization ages and potentially source ages.  Such a study is required in
              a well constrained tectonic  setting if the source of A-type granites is to be 
              understood.
