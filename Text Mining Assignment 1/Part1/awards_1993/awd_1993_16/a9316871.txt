Abstract    :
              9316871  Henyey     This research is to reduce and analyze seismic reflection
              data  from the Mojave Desert and San Bernardino Mountains in Southern 
              California.  The seismic data were collected using three-channel  portable
              recorders to detect seismic waves generated by aftershocks  of the 1992 M=7.5
              Landers earthquake.  The goal of the experiment  is to study the depth of the
              crust in the region by comparing the  travel time differences between waves
              traveling through the crust  and those reflected from the base of the crust. 
              Crustal depths are  important to models of the shape of the San Andreas fault
              surface  in the southern California region.  This research is a component of 
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
