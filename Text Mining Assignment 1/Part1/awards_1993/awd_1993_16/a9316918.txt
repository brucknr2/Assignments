Abstract    :
              9316918  Showers       PI and team will continue to conduct high-precision
              stable-  isotope analyses of dinosaur bones, as well as tests for  diagenesis,
              in order to determine paleophysiology and migratory  habits of dinosaurs.  
              This phase of the project will focus on two  Permian pelycosaurs, a Jurassic
              stegasaur and sauropod, and a  Cretaceous therapod (tyrannosaur).  In order to
              evaluate bone  isotope patterns, skeletal elements of a modern ostrich and a 
              modern elephant will also be examined.
