Abstract    :
              9316347  Bruhn    The development of abnormally pressured fluid compartments is 
              crucial to the evolution of fold and fault belts.  This project  will
              investigate three fundamental hypotheses concerning abnormally  pressured fluid
              compartments in the Cook Inlet region of south-  central Alaska, and will
              involve integration of surface mapping,  subsurface geophysical and rock data,
              and various laboratory  measurements.  Results will be incorporated  into a
              predictive  model for the generation and evolution of abnormally pressured 
              compartments in regional transcurrent and related fault systems.  ***
