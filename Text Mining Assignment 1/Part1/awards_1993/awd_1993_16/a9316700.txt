Abstract    :
              9316700  DeCelles       Critical-wedge models provide useful generalization of 
              the gross geometry of fold-thrust belts and accretionary  wedges, as well as
              specific predictions for their internal  kinematic development and rheologic
              behavior.  However,  comparison of critical-wedge models to geologic examples
              has  been limited to static analysis of modern accretionary  wedges and
              fold-thrust belts and with only partial success  in ancient foreland
              fold-thrust belts.  Present models  remain largely untested in four area: 
              wedge shape through  time, internal wedge structure, effect of erosion and 
              foreland basin subsidence, and link between material  properties and the
              discrete internal structures such as  foreland-younging fold-thrusts.  This
              project will address  these issues by focusing on quantitative incremental 
              retrodeformation of wedge shape and internal thrust geometry  for a 36 million
              year period of hinterland basement uplift  and foreland thin-skinned thrust
              slip in the well-known  Wyoming-Utah Sevier Thrust Belt.  Results are expected
              to  test several important correlaries of the critical-wedge  theory, as well
              as help resolve regional questions  concerning the geometric and kinematic
              relationships between  faults in this thrust belt.
