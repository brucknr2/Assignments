Abstract    :
              9316029  Silver       Surface uplift rates during orogenesis is an important but
               difficult to measure parameter, as it is the results of tectonic  uplift and
              erosion.  This project will complete a study of the  Finisterre Mountains of
              Papua New Guinea where circumstances allow  this parameter to be measured due
              to recent uplift of abundantly  fossiliferous sediments that are still nearly
              intact.  Results will  have considerable significance to tectonic models and 
              interpretations of surface uplift in other Orogens.
