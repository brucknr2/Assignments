Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9316535  Meyer  This project will lead to
              the development, for flight on a long-  duration Antarctic circum-polar
              balloon, of a telescope to measure  the cosmic microwave background radiation
              (CMBR) anisotropy.  The  instrument will be mounted on the upper surface of the
              balloon in  order to eliminate interference from radiation being scattered into
               the aperture by the balloon and connecting structures such as  cables and it
              is expected that the systematic errors will be less  than one millionth of a
              kelvin.  The CMBR will be measured at five  frequencies from 150 to 630 GHz and
              on angular scales from 0.5 to  3 degrees.  The instrument will not be flown in
              Antarctica until  after it has been tested in the U.S.    The project will be
              partially supported by NASA and will be funded  by the Office of Polar Programs
              and the Division of Astronomical  Sciences at NSF.  The collaboration includes
              investigators from  four US universities, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and
              the  Danish Space Research Institute.  ***
