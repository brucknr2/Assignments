Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9316750  Engebretson  This project will
              provide search coil magnetometers to be installed  in Antarctica in four
              Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGOs)  which are being built by the
              British Antarctic Survey (BAS).  They  will be used to study ultra low
              frequency (ULF) waves of  magnetospheric and ionospheric origin.  In
              combination with manned  Antarctic stations and the AGOs being deployed by the
              US Antarctic  Program, this new set of magnetometers will complete a network
              from  deep in the polar cap to subauroral latitudes and will also provide 
              nearly complete coverage under the fields of view of the auroral  radar at the
              BAS station at Halley Bay and the soon to be installed  radars at Sanae and
              Syowa Stations.  The Halley and Sanae radars  are collaborative efforts between
              Johns Hopkins University, BAS and  the South African National Antarctic
              Expedition.  The final array  of AGOs will comprise a network covering a much
              larger range of  magnetic latitude and local time than can ever be built on a
              solid  surface in the Northern Hemisphere.    Augsburg College is an entirely
              undergraduate institution and this  grant is a Research at an Undergraduate
              Institution (RUI) award.  ***
