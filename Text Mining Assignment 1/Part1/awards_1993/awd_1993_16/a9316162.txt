Abstract    :
              9316162  Stuiver  This award is for support of a two year program to obtain a
              high-  resolution time series of cosmogenic Beryllium-10 (10Be) and 
              Chlorine-36 (36Cl) from two shallow firn cores which have been  retrieved from
              Taylor Dome and upper Taylor Glacier, East  Antarctica.  The work will
              complement the ice-core paleoclimate and  glaciological studies already
              underway at Taylor Dome and should  contribute to a better understanding of the
              atmospheric transport  and depositional mechanisms of these isotopes.  The 10Be
              and 36Cl  time series will help to determine cosmogenic isotope production 
              rates over annual to millennial time periods, which will provide  information
              on solar and geomagnetic variability.  ***
