Abstract    :
              9316133  Mackenzie       The main goals of the proposed research are to evaluate
               responses of the coupled carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur 
              biogeochemical cycles to climate and global change in the land-  coastal margin
              system on decadal to millennial time scales, and the  contribution of this
              system to global environmental change.  This  system will be in the future one
              of the world's most disturbed  because of human activities.  Because of the
              great complexity of  the land-coastal margin system, it is necessary that
              observational  programs for individual ecosystems be complemented by data 
              synthesis and modeling of behavior of the system on a global scale.   Herein we
              propose a research program to "aid" in the accomplishment  of this task. 
              Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur are the four  main building blocks
              (excluding oxygen and hydrogen) of organic  matter, and they are incorporated
              within certain proportions, known  as the Redfield ratios, by marine plankton
              and terrestrial  vegetation.  Thus, study of these elemental components of the 
              Earth-surface system is important in the context of global change  and biotic
              responses to change.
