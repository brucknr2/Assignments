Abstract    :
              9316914  Paulsen      This award will support the participation of ten U.S.
              scientists  to take part in a workshop on heat tolerance in temperate cereal 
              plants to be held at Kona, Hawaii in February 1994.  The American  coordinator
              is Prof. Gary Paulsen from Kansas State University.  The Australian organizer
              is Dr. Ian Wardlaw of the CSIRO  Institute of Plant Production in Canberra. The
              workshop is being  conducted under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science
              Program  and support in Australia is provided through the Department of 
              Industry, Technology and Regional Development (DITARD).    Recent advances in
              both the U.S. and Australia have increased the  understanding of heat shock and
              high temperatures on grain yield  and quality.  This workshop will provide an
              interactive forum for  scientists in molecular biology, plant physiology, plant
              genetics  and cereal chemistry to discuss high temperature stress in  plants. 
              Although the workshop is primarily concerned with the  response of wheat to
              high temperatures, other crop plants and  biological systems will be included
              where they can assist in  better understanding the mechanisms which result from
              stressful  environments.
