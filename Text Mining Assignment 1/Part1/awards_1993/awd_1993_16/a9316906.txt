Abstract    :
              Hooper  9316906  In soils, fertilizer ammonia is oxidized to nitrite (NH3 + 1.5
              02->  HNO2 + H2) by the chemoautotrophic nitrifying bacterium  Nitrosomonas
              europaea.. Nitrite is oxidized by Nitrobacter to  nitrate, a primary source of
              N for food protein in non-leguminous  crops.  Of great economic transformation
              of most food nitrogen is  carried out by Nitrosomonas.  Of great economic
              importance is loss  of N in soils as N-gases produced by Nitrosomonas during
              oxidation  of NH3 or by reduction of nitrate by denitrifying bacteria.  
              Control of agricultural loss by denitrification is attempted by the  use of
              inhibitors of ammonia oxidation by Nitrosomonas.  This gives  significance to
              improved knowledge of the mechanism of oxidation of  ammonia.  NH3 is
              oxygenated by O2 to NH2OH which is then oxidized (NH2OH +  H20-> HN02 + 4e- +
              4H+) by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase  "HAO".  HAO is a large and
              unusually complex hemoprotein (7 c-hemes  and 1 substrate binding.  "P460"
              group per 63 kDa protein).  Four  electron pass from HAO to a tetraheme
              cytochrome c-554.  Two  electrons pass from cytochrome c-554 in a separate
              electron  transfer chain to the ammonia oxidizing reaction.  Two additional 
              electrons pass to a membrane terminal oxidase, a dissimilatory  nitrite
              reductase (during growth at low oxygen), to an ATP-  dependent NAD reductase or
              a peroxidase (to scavange peroxide).  The goal of this project is the analysis
              of the enzyme HAo.  We  intend to determine details of the structure of HAO
              with particular  attention to the active site and mechanism of turnover.  The 
              approach involves optical spectroscopy, peptide analysis, kinetics,  suicide
              substrates, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy,  Mossbauer
              spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic analysis.  %%%  The soil and water
              bacterium, Nitrosomonas, is critical to the  cycle of nitrogen in nature, to
              the production of a greenhouse and  ozone destroying gas, to nitrogen
              availability in agriculture and  in the degradation of chlori nated pollutants.
               This project is  involved in the study of the structure of the biological
              catalyst  which enables the organism to perform those roles.  The enzyme 
              oxidizes one of the nitrogenous intermediates, hydroxylamine, to  nitrite.  Is
              called hydroxylamine oxidoreductase.  We intend to complete the determination
              of the structure of the  enzyme.  Then, by studying changes in the color of
              groups on the  enzyme and by measuring the production of intermediate compounds
              by  chemical means, we will find out how it is able to act as a  catalyst for
              this unusual reaction.  ***
