Abstract    :
              9316242  Carr       This award provides funding for the acquisition of an 
              inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer system that will be  housed and
              operated in the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers  University. The instrument
              has the ability to measure the  concentration of most elements dissolved in
              water or dilute acids  down to very low concentration levels. It will be used
              primarily in  the research of geochemists at Rutgers who are engaged in
              research  on Central American and Hawaiian volcanoes, iridium deposition in 
              Greenland ice cores for interpretation of past climate changes,  trace metal
              scavenging in the oceans, deep sea spherules, and the  composition of
              meteorites.  ***
