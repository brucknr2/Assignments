Abstract    :
              9316304  Patino Douce  This project  involves a systematic phase equilibrium 
              investigation of the thermodynamic properties of phlogopite  solid solution in
              the system MgO-Al2O3-TiO2-SiO2-K2O-H2O.  The experimental program will be based
              upon determining the  composition of phlogopite solid solutions equilibrated in
               divariant phase assemblages  which, at constant temperature  and pressure, fix
              the chemical potentials of the components  of the mica.  Approach to
              equilibrium will be established by  isothermal and isobaric compositional
              reversals along a set  of exchange vectors chosen to describe the composition
              of  the solid understanding of processes such as mantle  metasomatism and
              generation of potassic mafic magmas.
