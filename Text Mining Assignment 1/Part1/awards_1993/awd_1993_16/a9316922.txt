Abstract    :
              9316922  Wassall      This award will support the travel of Dr. Stephen Wassall
              of the  Department of Physics, Indiana University - Purdue University at 
              Indianapolis, for a three-month visit to conduct collaborative  research with
              Dr. Bruce Cornell and Dr. Frances Separovic in the  laboratories of the
              Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial  Research Organization (CSIRO) Division
              of Food Science and  Technology located in Sydney, Australia. The project will 
              establish the feasibility of employing rotational-echo, double  resonance
              (REDOR) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to ascertain  the confirmation of an
              isotopically labelled peptide bound to a  phospholipid model membrane.   
              Elucidation of peptide and protein structure within membranes  presents a
              daunting challenge. The techniques of solid state NMR  are likely to be
              extremely useful. The goal of this research is  to investigate REDOR NMR
              spectroscopy as a method of measuring  interatomic distances between labelled
              sites in melittin bound to  a phospholipid membrane. The collaboration will
              bring together  two research groups with a common interest in magnetic
              resonance  of membranes.
