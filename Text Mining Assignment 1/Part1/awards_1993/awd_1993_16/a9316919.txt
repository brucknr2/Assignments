Abstract    :
              9316919  Atela       The investigator plans to study several problems in complex
               dynamical systems including the geometry of the Mandelbrot set.  Another
              component of the research involves study of the three  body problem in
              celestial mechanics along with bifurcation and  chaotic phenomena.
              Undergraduate students will also be supervised  as part of the scope. The
              research has potential applications to  cosmology, fractals and the analysis of
              chaos.  ***
