Abstract    :
              9316285  Bilham      The PI will perform research to complement the CASA project
              with dense linear arrays of geodetic points designed to determine the plate
              velocity field across the SE Caribbean plate boundary.  In this way he can
              determine the distribution of plate boundary displacements among the several
              significant faults in the region, allowing better estimates of recurrence rates
              for damaging earthquakes.  Aves Island and 4 other locations will be
              instrumented with deep borehole reference monuments with a 3D stability of +/-1
              mm.  Aves is a crucial measurement point for Caribbean plate studies because it
              is far from a plate boundary and the PI will be monitoring this site for
              ongoing GPS projects elsewhere in the Caribbean.  The research will be
              undertaken collaboratively with Venezuelan scientists who will provide 30% of
              the equipment and 100% of the field logistical costs in Venezuela.  ****
