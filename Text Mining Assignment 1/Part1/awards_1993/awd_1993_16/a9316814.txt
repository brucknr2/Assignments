Abstract    :
              9316358  Ni         This is a project to deploy a passive-source broadband
              seismic  array to complement the core reflection profiling experiment  (INDEPTH
              II - a funded CD project) across the Tsangpo Suture in  Tibet.  The array will
              be equipped with 12 broadband seismometers  contributed by the P.I.'s German
              colleagues, and will record for 8-  9 months beginning in May, 1994.         
              Although the reflection profiling experiment is expected to  image the top of
              the underthrusting Indian Plate, the behavior of  the mantle part of the
              lithosphere is unknown.  The anomalous  velocity structure of the upper mantle
              beneath southern Tibet can  be imaged by a passive-source PASSCAL-type
              experiment.  The main  objective of the proposed broadband study is to search
              for the  mantle downwelling beneath southern Tibet.  ***
