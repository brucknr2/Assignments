Abstract    :
              9316719  Santiago  The cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) is a DNA 
              binding protein required for the transcription of the  somatostatin gene.  This
              protein's usual narrow DNA binding  selectivity is broadened upon heterodimer
              formation with the pX  protein (from hepatitis B virus).  Two dimensional NMR 
              spectroscopy will be utilized to characterize this change in DNA  binding
              specificity.  Specific aims include: (1) characterize the  CREB:DNA
              interaction, (2) Determine the solution structure of  chimeric CREB peptides
              that exhibit DNA binding similar to the  native CREB, and (3) attempt to modify
              DNA recognition by CREB  homodimers.  %%%  DNA-protein interactions are of
              fundamental importance to the  control of cell physiology.  The leucine zipper
              is a structural  element found in many DNA-binding proteins.  Structural
              studies  of many leucine zipper structures have established the ground  rules
              for specific recognition of DNA by zipper dimers.  The CREB  protein (cyclic
              AMP responsive element binding protein): DNA  interaction is itself modulated
              by interactions with a protein  from hepatitis B virus.  Of major importance is
              development of an  understanding of the modulation of the binding specificity
              of a  zipper:DNA interaction.  This study could point the way to a  broader
              understanding of the control of gene expression.  ***
