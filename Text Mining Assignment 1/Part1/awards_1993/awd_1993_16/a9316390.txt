Abstract    :
              9316390  Richter  A detailed study of diffusion in molten SiO2 and GeO2 is 
              proposed.  Combined Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and  laboratory
              experiments for the magnitude, activation energy,  and activation volume for
              the self-diffusion of Si, O, and  Ge will be carried out.  The laboratory
              experiments will  provide important benchmarks with which to test the validity 
              of MD simulations carried out using a variety of  representations of the
              pair-potentials.  Presently used  potentials are reasonably successful at
              reproducing various  static properties of  liquid SiO2, but they have not been 
              tested in terms of their ability to reproduce kinetic  quantities such as the
              diffusivity of atomic species.  Validating the MD simulations for a simple
              oxides is a  necessary first step towards the realistic representation of 
              silicate melts, and will provide a basis for understanding  diffusion at an
              atomistic level.  A question of particular  interest is why do all recent MD
              simulations of liquid SiO2  find that the self-diffusion of Si and O are
              virtually the  same while laboratory experiments on mixed oxide systems  always
              find them to be significantly different?
