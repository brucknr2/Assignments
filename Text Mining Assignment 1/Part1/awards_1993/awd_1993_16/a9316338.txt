Abstract    :
              9316338  Jacobel  This award is for support for a program of glaciological
              studies of  Siple Dome and its surroundings between Ice Streams C and D.  The 
              purpose of the work is to characterize the dynamic environment and  ice
              stratigraphy to aid in the assessment of Siple Dome as a  potential deep ice
              core site, and to determine whether the  configuration of ice stream flow in
              the region was different in the  past than now.  The work involves measurements
              of the configuration  and continuity of internal layers in the ice, using radar
              echo  sounding and determination of velocity field, based on standard GPS 
              surveying.  The goals of the work are relevant to understanding the  dynamics
              of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), its past history  and its potential
              future behavior, including possible effects on  global sea level.  This work is
              a collaborative project between the  University of Washington, the University
              of Colorado and St. Olaf  College.  ***
