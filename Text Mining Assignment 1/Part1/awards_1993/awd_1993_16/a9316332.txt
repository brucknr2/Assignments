Abstract    :
              9316332  Wheatly    This proposal is a request to support a two-day symposium 
              entitled "Calcium Regulation:  Mechanisms and Control in  Crustaceans and Lower
              Vertebrates" at the Intersociety  Comparative Physiology Meeting to be held in
              San Diego, CA  from October 29 through November 2, 1994.  This meeting is 
              sponsored by the comparative physiology and biochemistry  sections of the
              American Physiological Society (primary  sponsor), the American Society of
              Zoologists, the Canadian  Society of Zoologists, the British Society for
              Experimental  Biology and the German Society of Zoologists.  The theme of  the
              meeting is "Regulation, Integration, Adaptation:  A  Species Approach".  The
              proposed symposium, which is the  first of its kind, will bring together an
              international  cadre of researchers using a variety of animal model systems  in
              which to study basic mechanisms of calcium regulation.  The symposium will use
              a multidisciplinary approach to  discuss calcium balance at levels ranging from
              whiole animal  processes down through epithelial/subcellular mechanisms and 
              ultimately to molecular control.  Model animal systems will  include
              crustaceans, fish, amphibians, birds, and reptiles.  This integrated approach
              will have applicability to a wide  range of physiological disciplines.  The
              symposium will be  published in the journal Physiological Zoology.  ***
