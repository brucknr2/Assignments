Abstract    :
              9316980  Mao      The PIs will continue their systematic study of the equations
              of state and elasticity of Earth Materials with diamond-anvil cells.  They will
              use synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques to determine lattice parameters
              and molar volumes, and Brillouin spectroscopy to determine compressional and
              shear wave velocities, both at high pressure and temperature.  With recently
              established experimental techniques, they will systematically acquire a
              comprehensive and accurate database representative of realistic Earth
              compositional models.  They will continue to extend experimental capabilities
              of accurate determinations of elastic properties to higher pressure and
              temperature, and will conduct reconnaissance experiments at the extreme P-T
              conditions of the lower mantle and core.  The acquired database will be applied
              to constrain structural, dynamic, and evolutionary models of the Earth's deep
              interior.  ****
