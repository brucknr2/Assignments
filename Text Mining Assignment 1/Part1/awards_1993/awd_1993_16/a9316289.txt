Abstract    :
              9316289  Nash  Our preliminary data and the results of other workers  indicate
              that during the    16 Ma evolution  of the  Yellowstone thermal anomaly the
              frequency of eruption has  varied significantly, as has the temperature,
              chemical and  isotopic composition of magmas.  This proposed study intends  to
              examine each of these parameters within a well  constrained temporal framework.
               The PIs proposed to collect  and analyze tephra erupted during the evolution
              of the  Yellowstone thermal anomaly in order to:  1) Measure the  frequency and
              volumes of explosive eruption, assess possible  periodicity in eruption rate,
              and evaluate suggested gaps in  explosive activity; 2) Determine the major and
              trace element  chemical composition of glass and phenocrysts; 3) Use  mineral
              thermometers to determine temperatures of magmas; 4)  Measure Nd and Sr
              isotopic ratios to determine relative  input of mantle and crustal sources into
              the silicic magma  generating system, and to record the effect of eastward 
              translation of the thermal anomaly from accreted oceanic  ltihosphere to the
              continental craton.  This study will  provide an integrated investigation of
              the evolution of the  major thermal anomaly and should lead to a better 
              understanding of the interaction of this type of heat source  with the
              continental lithosphere.
