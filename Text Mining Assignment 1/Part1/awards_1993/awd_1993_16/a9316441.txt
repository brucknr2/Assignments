Abstract    :
              9316441  Helmberger    This research is to determine the detailed nature of the
              lateral  variation in the D" layer of the earth's mantle, the portion just 
              above the earth's core.  Most of the present methods that image  this deep
              structure must correct for the intervening mantle  structure.  Since there is
              poor consistency in derived mantle  structure, most 3-D global models predict
              discordant differential  times for core-phases, branches of PKP and SKS.  This
              work will use  differential times and waveform information to assess lateral 
              variation in the deep mantle structure from the bottom-up, as  opposed to the
              normal procedure of top-down.  However, this  requires a great deal of study of
              the inner and outer core to  establish their uniformity so that variation in
              differential times  are mapped properly.
