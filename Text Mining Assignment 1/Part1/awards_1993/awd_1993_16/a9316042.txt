Abstract    :
              9316042  Dallmeyer       Recent petrological, geochronological and structural
              studies  of the Eastern Alps and Carpathian Mts. suggest that a separate 
              Mesozoic collisional event occurred in this region between the  Adriatic
              microplate and the overridden European plate.  The precise  timing of
              collisional events in this area is unknown, and this  project will provide
              systematic 40Ar/39Ar mineral and whole rock  ages along three traverses across
              the Internal Alps and  Carpathians.  A special emphasis will be the dating of
              muscovite  from mylonitic deformation zones.  Collaboration with scientists in 
              Austria, Hungaria, Romania and Slovakia will provide the structural  and
              geological framework.  The results will provide tight  constraints on the
              timing of individual collisional and extensional  events during the evolution
              of this important sector of the Alpine-  Himalayan orogenic chain and will have
              implications for tectonic  reconstructions of the region.
