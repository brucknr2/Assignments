Abstract    :
              9316715  Taylor  This award is for support  to collect micrometeorites from the 
              bottom of the new water well at South Pole Station, Antarctica.   The large
              volume of firn and ice being melted provides the  concentrating mechanism
              needed to collect large numbers of  micrometeorites that occur in low
              concentrations in the ice.  The  first task of the project is to design a
              collection system to  retrieve the micrometeorites from the bottom of the water
              well.     The collector must be reliable, easy to operate, must collect all 
              particles larger than 10 mm and should not contaminate the well's  water
              quality.  Following successful design and deployment of the  collector,
              recovered particles will be catalogued and distributed  to interested
              researchers.   ***
