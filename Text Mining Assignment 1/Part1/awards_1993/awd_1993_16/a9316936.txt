Abstract    :
              9316936  Schleicher    This award will support the travel of David Schleicher
              from the  Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona to spend six weeks  in the
              spring of 1994 conducting collaborative research on the  physical and chemical
              properties of three specific comets with  Peter Birch at the Perth Observatory
              in Australia.    Observations of Comet Encke will concentrate on discerning the
               nature of coma structures known to occur in this comet.  Images  of Comet
              Mueller will either be used to determine spatial  profiles of the various gas
              species or to search for a rotational  signal, depending upon whether the comet
              is static or varying on  a day-to-day basis. Comet Borrelly, one of a class of
              carbon-  depleted comets, also will be studied for periodic variations.  In
              Australia, the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional  Development has
              already made an award to support the reciprocal  visit of Peter Birch to the
              Lowell Observatory during 1994.
