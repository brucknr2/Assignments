Abstract    :
              9316177  Archer  PIs will conduct sedimentological analyses of the Proterozoic
              Big  Cottonwood Formation, including facies and basin analysis,  attempted
              correlation, and detailed studies of tidal rhythmites.   The rhythmites are the
              oldest yet documented and offer an  opportunity to study paleoseasonality,
              lunar cycles, lunar  recession rates, and paleotidal and paleorotational
              periods,  extending knowledge of tidal settings and earth-moon dynamics 
              several hundred million years farther into Earth history.
