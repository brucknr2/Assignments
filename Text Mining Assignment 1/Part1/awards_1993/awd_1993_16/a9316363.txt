Abstract    :
              9316363  Anderson       PI will examine how tectonics, paleoceanography,
              paleoclimate  and paleoenvironment affected evolution of an important group of 
              shallow-marine bivalves, the Corbulidae.  Study will include:  1)  sampling
              units in Florida and the Atlantic coastal plain to  supplement existing
              collections; 2) morphometric analyses; and 3)  cladistic and stratophenic
              analyses to establish evolutionary  relationships among species.  This work
              will contribute to the  large-scale Panama Paleontology Project, the goal of
              which is to  document the closing through time of the Isthmus of Panama and the
               response of organisms to that process.
