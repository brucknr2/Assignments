Abstract    :
              9316467  Kyle       This award provides one-half the funding necessary to
              acquire  an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer system (XRF) to be installed and 
              operated in the Department of Geosciences at the New Mexico  Institute of
              Mining and Technology. The institution is committed to  providing the remaining
              funds needed for the purchase.       The new XRF system will be used primarily
              in research projects    needing the accurate multi-element chemical composition
              analysis  capability of the instrument for geological materials. These active 
              projects, directed by the Principal Investigator and colleagues at  the New
              Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, include research  in the areas of
              crustal evolution, petrology and volcanology,  Quaternary studies, and
              environmental studies. The instrument will  also be made available to qualified
              users both on-campus and off-  campus, statewide and regionally.  ***
