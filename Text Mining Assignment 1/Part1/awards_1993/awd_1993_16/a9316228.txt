Abstract    :
              Somasundaran  9316228    SGER:  Polymer/Surfactant and Protein/Lipid
              Interactions at  Aqueous Interfaces    This Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research (SGER) applies  recently developed methods in air/water surface
              micromanometry  to obtain the thermodynamic parameters for selected polymers
              and  proteins referenced to near-ideal monolayer states at very low  surface
              pressures and densities.  These experiments should lead  to the entropies and
              other thermodynamic functions for dense  non-ideal conditions.  The exploratory
              results will be used to  adapt the surface micromanometry method to the
              measurement of  interactions of polymers and proteins with surfactants.  The 
              results are expected to give information on polymer  confirmations and the
              energetics of polymer-amphiphiles  complexes at the fluid interfaces and to
              assist progress in  several technologies, including the preparation of
              molecular  assemblies on the nano scale, characterization and use of chiral 
              complexes, aspects of the mechanisms of drug action related to  membranes,
              wettability and foam and emulsion control.  The grant  provides for the
              transfer of equipment from British Petroleum  ***
