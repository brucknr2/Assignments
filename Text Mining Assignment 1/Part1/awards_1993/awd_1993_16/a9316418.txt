Abstract    :
              9316418  Baldwin    New Caledonia occurs as a mainly continental fragment on the
               Norfolk Ridge System in the southwest Pacific, and records  deformation
              between ocean crust of the Pacific plate and  continental crust of the Indian
              plate subsequent to the break-up of  the eastern margin of Gondwana.  The
              high-pressure metamorphic belt  of New Caledonia is one of the youngest
              blueschist and eclogite  belts on earth.  This study is part of a large
              international  project on New Caledonia, and involves an age dating program on 
              these rocks.  Results will provide age constraints on various  events in the
              tectonic evolution of New Caledonia and its  relationship to New Zealand and
              Australia along the eastern margin  of Gondwana.  ***
