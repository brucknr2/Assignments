Abstract    :
              9316701  Hyman       Transcription termination, defined as the release of the 
              nascent transcript and dissociation of RNA polymerase from the  template, is
              arguably the least well understood aspect of  eukaryotic transcription.  The
              goal of the proposed research is  to contribute to defining the mechanism(s)
              that are responsible  for termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II. 
              There are  two specific aims.  The first describes experiments that address 
              which sequences are required to direct 3' end formation in vivo.   Models
              proposing that a secondary structure may be important for  this event will be
              tested.  The second aim is to utilize an in  vitro biochemical assay to
              complement, and extend the molecular  approach.  %%%  The focus of much
              research in molecular biology is in the study  of gene expression.  This is
              concerned with how genes are turned  on in some cell types but not others. 
              This work is concerned  with how transcription, an important step in gene
              expression, is  controlled.  Specifically we will ask how the enzyme which is 
              responsible for the transcription reaction stops at the  appropriate place in
              the gene.  This reaction is referred to as  transcription termination.  Little
              is known about transcription  termination yet it is an extremely important part
              of fundamental  cell mechanisms.  ***
