Abstract    :
              9316233  Cruickshank    This Gordon Research Conference on Gas Surface
              Interactions  includes a heavy emphasis on multidisciplinary activity of high 
              interest to materials research and development and will involve  chemical
              physicists, chemical engineers, and material scientists.   Its topical emphasis
              is at the interface of basic scientific  research and technologies that include
              electronic and catalytic  materials, and the emphasis will be on exciting new
              research  developments, and on defining new research directions.  One of the 
              most exciting aspects of this Gordon Research Conference is the  daily poster
              session where graduate students present new results.   The funds provided by
              NSF will be targeted mainly towards the  support of graduate students and
              postdocs.  ***
