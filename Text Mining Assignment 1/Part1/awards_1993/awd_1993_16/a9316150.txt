Abstract    :
              9316150  Jackson    This research is to investigate recently documented
              correlations  between the incremental stress from an earthquake and the
              locations  of subsequent earthquakes or aftershocks.  The Harvard earthquake 
              catalog of seismic moment tensor solutions will be used to  investigate
              statistical properties of the incremental static stress  caused by earthquakes.
               Normal and shear stress will be resolved in  the focal zone of each event and
              then calculated at the site of a  future event.  Preliminary results indicate
              that shear stress,  rather than normal stress, affects the locations of future
              events.   This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard 
              Reduction Program.  ***
