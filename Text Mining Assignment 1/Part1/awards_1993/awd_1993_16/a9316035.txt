Abstract    :
              9316035  Gowing  The growing season for phytoplankton in polar oceans is short,
              but  intense.  There is an increasing body of evidence that in many  Antarctic
              habitats, the most active period may be very early in the  season, a period
              that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part
              of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring
              phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the
              Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation
              of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms
              controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications
              and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from
              spring to  midsummer conditions.  The focus of this proposal is the role of 
              microzooplankton in controlling the production and fate of carbon  during the
              two types of blooms.  Objectives are: 1) to determine  biomass, abundance, size
              and selected species composition of  primary producer assemblages, 2) to
              determine similar features of  nano- and microplanktonic heterotrophic
              assemblages, 3) to measure  total community grazing on heterotrophic bacteria
              and  phytoplankton, 4) to examine which grazers are the major herbivores  and
              bacterivores, and 5) to measure the contribution of  microzooplankton and
              mesozooplankton egesta, sinking of algal cells  and colonies, and sinking of
              protozoan assemblages associated with  detritus to the total carbon flux from
              the euphotic zone through  250 m depth.  Water samples for abundance and
              biomass  determinations will be taken and samples will be examined with 
              epifluorescence microscopy.  Grazing rates will be measured using  the dilution
              grazing technique and the dual-isotope radiolabeling  single cell method. 
              Carbon fluxes will be determined on sinking  material collected with particle
              interceptor traps at the base of  the euphotic zone and two deeper depths,
              using microscopical  analysis .  An understanding of these processes and other 
              fundamental processes studied by collaborating investigators will  contribute
              to the understanding of the role of the Southern Ocean  in present, past and
              predicted future sequestration of carbon, as  well as in other global elemental
              cycles.
