Abstract    :
              9316465  Bennett    This project seeks to quantify the mass transport properties
              of  fracture skins and to sue these properties in simulations of mass 
              transport in flowing ground water.  The project builds on  preliminary studies
              on fracture-skin properties conducted at the  University of Texas at Austin. 
              These studies investigated both  welded tuffs and Paleozoic sandstones and
              documented fundamental  changes in rock porosity, permeability, and mineralogy
              in the skins  when compared to the unaltered rock.  This project will expand
              this  effort and will, for the first time to our knowledge, estimate the 
              diffusion coefficients and sorptivities of fracture skins through  closely
              controlled laboratory experiments.  Two experimental  apparatuses will be
              constructed to estimate these properties.  One  design will examine sorption by
              fractures skins in an artificial  fracture-column under conditions of forced
              ground-water flow.  The  second design will utilize wafers or disks, designed
              for use in The  University of Texas electronic minipermeameter, to measure 
              diffusion coefficients and sorption for samples of fracture skins  and
              unaltered rock matrices.  These data will be utilized in  analytical and/or
              numerical models to estimate how fracture skins  alter the rates of mass
              transport.  The results may be significant  in problems of siting radioactive
              (and other) waste disposal  facilities, extraction of petroleum from fractured
              reservoirs, and  a variety of fundamental geological problems, such as
              diagenesis,  formation of mineral deposits, and calculation of ground-water 
              recharge.  ***
