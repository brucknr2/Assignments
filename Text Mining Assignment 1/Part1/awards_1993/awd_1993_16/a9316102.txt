Abstract    :
              9316102  Rice       This award provides partial funding to support a technician 
              assigned to the electron-microprobe and scanning electron  microscope image
              analysis laboratories in the Department of  Geological Sciences at the
              University of Oregon.       The laboratories' analytical capabilities offer
              faculty and  students in the departments of geological sciences, chemistry and 
              physics opportunities to study minerals, rocks, and synthetic  materials at
              state-of-the-art resolution in chemical composition  and imaging. Full-time
              technical support for the laboratories is  needed to maintain and operate the
              facility and to fully develop  the capabilities of the instrumentation.  ***
