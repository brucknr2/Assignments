Abstract    :
              9316895  Miller       PI, collaborator Oscar Carranza (UNAM, Mexico), and an 
              assembled team of experts will collect and study Mio-Pliocene-age  vertebrate
              fossils from key localities in central Mexico.  They  will obtain greater
              chronostratigraphic precision for this time  period in the terrestrial record,
              including magnetostratigraphy,  and radiometric dates from ash beds within the
              fossil-bearing  sequences.  This study will help date earliest occurrences of 
              important mammalian taxa, including South American immigrants, and  provide
              valuable data for comparisons with similar fossil-bearing  sequences elsewhere
              in North America.
