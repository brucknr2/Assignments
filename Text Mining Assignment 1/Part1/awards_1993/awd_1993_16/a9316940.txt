Abstract    :
              9316940  Logan       It has been known for sometime that pore fluids can 
              dramatically affect the strength of fault zones, but a variety of  possible
              explanations for the phenomena have not been fully  resolved.  This study will
              combine experimental deformation  experiments on fault materials with detailed
              field studies and will  focus on chemical weakening of clay-rich fault zones. 
              Experimental  results on changes in mechanical strength and sample chemistry
              with  changing pore-fluid composition, temperature, pressure, and strain  rate
              will be related to corresponding change in microstructures of  the fault gouge.
               Experimentally-generated fault-zone fabrics will  be compared with those in
              the field.  Result will allow evaluation  of the relative importance of fluid
              chemistry on rock behavior in  the vicinity of fault zones.
