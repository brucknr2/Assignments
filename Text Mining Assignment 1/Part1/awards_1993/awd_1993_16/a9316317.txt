Abstract    :
              9316317  Byrne       Whether or not porphyroblasts rotate during deformation is
              a  currently debated issue the outcome of which is important because  quite
              different conclusions of the tectonic/kinematic history  result from each
              model.  This project utilize staurolite  porphyroblasts to test the
              rotation/non-rotation models, taking  advantage of the different shapes and
              initial orientations of each  staurolite, and the predicted final orientations
              of each model.   Results, if successful, will help resolve the debate on the 
              behavior of porphyroblasts and clarify the correct use of  porphyroblasts in
              kinematic studies.
