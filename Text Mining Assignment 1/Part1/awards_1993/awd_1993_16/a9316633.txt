Abstract    :
              9316633  Ledley  This project is the application of an existing generalized sea
              ice  model to the particular regional setting of the Ross Sea.  A 
              smaller-scale version of the same model will be nested within the  regional
              model to represent McMurdo Sound.      The simulated sea ice fields will be
              validated through a comparison  with available observations, and used to assess
              the impact of sea  ice on ocean-atmosphere energy exchange processes.    After
              the model is adapted for the Ross Sea setting, and the  simulated seasonal sea
              ice variations have been validated, a series  of sensitivity studies will be
              carried out.  These will be designed  to examine the response of the sea ice to
              changes that may occur in  the regional climate system on both short and long
              time scales.    Finally, the model will be extended by nesting a finer grid 
              submodel in the Ross Sea model in order to examine the effects of  katabatic
              winds and synoptic weather variations on the sea ice  distribution.  ***
