Abstract    :
              9316474  Ralser       The Grenville Orogeny is the last of several period of 
              deformation to affect the PreCambrian rocks of Southwestern US.,  but is the
              least understood.  This project will peruse several  indications in existing
              geochronology that the effect of the  Grenville is present in the form of
              greenschist facies shear zones  in several mountain ranges in New Mexico. 
              Results will help  understand the distal effects of the Grenville an Older
              rocks in  this area, and may provide insights into how geochronological work 
              could clarify distal orogenic effects generally.
