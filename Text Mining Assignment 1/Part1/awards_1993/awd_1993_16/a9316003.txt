Abstract    :
              9316003  Fine  In this project, the PI's will use a four-layer numerical ocean 
              circulation model, with high horizontal resolution, to simulate  passive
              chemical tracer distributions that will be sampled in the  Indian Ocean during
              the WOCE Indian Ocean Expedition.  Particular  attention will be paid to the
              effects of seasonal variability on  the tracer distributions, and on the use of
              these distributions to  further refine the measurements of the general
              circulation of the  Indidan Ocean.
