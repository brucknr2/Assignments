Abstract    :
              9316452  Moore   The woodpeckers are a large group of birds, numbering about 171
              species, and are distributed over four continents.  Despite this diversity, the
              fossil record and the degree of genetic differentiation in the group suggest
              the woodpeckers are young in age, originating only about 6 million years ago. 
              In addition to being specialized for chiseling and drumming on wood,
              woodpeckers are characterized by bright and contrasting plumage patterns that
              are highly distinctive among species.  Our present understanding of the history
              of this group is based largely on plumage similarities.  Reconstructions of
              history based on molecular, DNA structure of the mitochondrial cytochrome b
              gene indicate that there is substantial misunderstanding of woodpecker
              relationships, and there are numerous cases where plumage patterns are similar
              due to independent history rather than common ancestry.  The PI will expand his
              preliminary work to reconstruct the genetic history of the woodpeckers based on
              a long sequence of the cytochrome b gene for approximately 200 specimens
              representing all the major groups of woodpeckers.  In addition to clarifying
              our understanding of the genetic history of a major group of birds, the study
              will serve as a model for understanding the relationship between the histories
              of individual genes (cytochrome b) and species (the woodpeckers).  ***
