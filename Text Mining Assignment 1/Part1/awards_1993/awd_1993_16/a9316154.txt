Abstract    :
              9316154  Zeitler       This award provides 64 % of the funds needed to implement
               automation of the analytical procedures used in the argon dating  laboratory
              in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at  Lehigh University.
              The University is committed to providing the  remaining funds necessary for the
              project. The Lehigh University  argon dating laboratory is providing age data
              for an extensive set  of research projects involving the principal
              investigator, students  and colleagues on- and off-campus. The current and
              projected load  of analytical work requires that the procedures be automated. 
              Research topics covered in the current work of the laboratory  include dating
              of rocks of the Himalaya, chronology of the rock  samples in the KTB deep
              borehole project in Germany,  thermochronology of the rocks recovered from the
              Newark Basin  scientific drilling project, and dating of the Manson Impact 
              Structure in the U.S.  ***
