Abstract    :
              9316012  Chen, W-P    This research is a continuation of investigation of the 
              mechanical state of the subducted lithosphere and its interaction  with the
              surrounding mantle.  Deep earthquakes in subduction zones  of Izu-Bonin, Japan,
              and Ryukyu-Kyushu arcs have been numerous  recently and have high-quality
              broad-band seismic recordings.  This  research involves precise determination
              of the rupture processes  for approximately 35 large to moderate-sized events
              deeper than 100  km in these zones.  The work will also involve investigation
              of the  patterns of travel-time residuals and anomalies in pulse- 
              width/amplitude of body waves from these events.  The results will  bear on
              questions of the origin of deep earthquakes and the depth  of penetration of
              the subducted slab.  ***
