Abstract    :
              9402044  Rothman    This grant is to partially support travel of U.S. Scientists
              to  the 20th International Conference on Mathematical Geophysics to be  held on
              June 19-24, 1994, in Villefranche-sur-mer, France.  The  conference meets every
              two years in different countries and is  sponsored by the Committee on
              Mathematical Geophysics of the  International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. 
              The conference is  entitled "Complex Space-Time Geophysical Structures"  and
              will  feature themes of 1) The Physics of Earthquakes, 2) Aspects of 
              Geophysical Turbulence, 3) Mantle Dynamics and Seismic Tomography,  and 4)
              Coupled Earth Processes.  ***
