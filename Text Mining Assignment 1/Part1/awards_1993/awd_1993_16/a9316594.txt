Abstract    :
              9316594  Kirz  A scanning soft x ray microscope has been built and put into
              operation at the National Synchrotron Light Source,  Brookhaven National 
              Laboratory.  The instrument makes use of the bright, tuneable undulator source
              at the X1A beamline. It uses zone plates fabricated under a Lawrence Berkeley
              Lab./IBM collaboration to form a 50 nm beam spot. The microscope is in routine
              operation, and is used by several groups to image wet biological specimens at
              the resolution set by the spot size.    New  imaging  modes  are  being 
              developed  that  extend  the applicability of the technique to map particular
              chemical states using  the  resonances  present  near  elemental  absorption 
              edges (XANES),  and using the detection of visible light  excited in
              fluorescent labels by the x ray beam.    In addition to continuing the
              operation of the microscope, support  is  requested  to  extend  the  XANES 
              contrast  imaging capability,  to  improve  substantially  the  stability  and 
              the resolution of the instrument, and to explore the possibilities in x ray
              microscopy at higher energies.    The team welcomes inquiries by investigators
              interested in using the instrument to solve biological problems matched to its
              unique capabilities.       u    ~ s &t &9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L
