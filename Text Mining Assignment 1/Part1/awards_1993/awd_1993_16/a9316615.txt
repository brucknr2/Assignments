Abstract    :
              9316615  Griffin  Most risk communication research focuses on what experts want
              to  convey to the public and how to do so efficiently.  Very little  is known,
              however, about how people use the risk information  available to them to make
              sense of risky situations.  This  project is to investigate how residents of
              Milwaukee rely on  their personal experience, and on the various mass and 
              interpersonal communications channels to develop their knowledge  and level of
              worry about tap-water borne parasitic disease  (cryptosporidiosis) in the wake
              of a recent widespread outbreak  in their city.  A random sample survey will be
              conducted by  telephone of 500 adults who live in the affected part of the 
              Milwaukee metropolitan area.  Since it is essential to gather the  data while
              personal memories of the experience with  cryptosporidiosis are fresh, while
              the outbreak is still  highlighted in the mass media, and while uncertainty
              still  remains about possible recurrences, this proposal is funded by  the
              Small Grants for Exploratory Research.  This effort is  conducted to prepare a
              more extensive research proposal that will  examine how people select and
              process information to cope with  risks in the world around them using an
              audience-based rather  than a sender-based approach to investigate risk
              communication.   ***
