Abstract    :
              The United States Patent and Trademark Office will provide  data to extend and
              expand data series concerning patenting  in the United States.    Data will
              include numbers of patents granted by year to  Americans and to citizens of
              other specified countries;  patents owned by individuals as opposed to private
              corporate  entities and governments; and, patents assigned to  universities and
              colleges.  Counts of granted patents will  be classified by both the Patent
              Office Classification  System and the Standard Industrial Classification
              System.    These data are used in the National Science Board's series  of
              Science and Engineering reports as indicators of levels  of technical invention
              in the various countries, sectors,  and fields.
