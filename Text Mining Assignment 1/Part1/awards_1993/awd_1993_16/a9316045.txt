Abstract    :
              9316045  Rohwer  The support will allow preparation and curation of 1500 frozen,
              oil-soaked carcasses salvaged in 1993 from the Exxon Valdiz oil spill under a
              previous NSF award.  These spring sea birds represent a unique series, as does
              the presence of a number of threatened and rare species and ones poorly known
              in collections. Graduate and work-study students will carry out the necessary
              preparation and curatorial tasks, and at the same time receive training in bird
              systematics and biodiversity studies. These salvaged pelagic birds will be
              extremely important for systematic, developmental and ecological study of
              plumage maturation, molt and skeletal variation.  %%%  In 1993, ornithologists
              at the University of Washington salvaged 1500 pelagic birds that had perished
              in the Exxon Valdiz oil spill.  These birds are all spring sea-birds, and thus
              represent a unique series for studying avian development, plumage maturation,
              molt patterns and other seasonal life-history phenomena.  Preparation and
              preservation of these oil-soaked carcasses will take special expertise and
              techniques that have been perfected at the University of Washington.  These
              specimens will then be made available for ongoing and future research and
              educational projects involving avian systematics, biodiversity and conservation
              in the Pacific northwest.  ***
