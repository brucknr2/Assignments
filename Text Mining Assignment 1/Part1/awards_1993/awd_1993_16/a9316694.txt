Abstract    :
              9316694  Lopilato  Genes are expressed or transcribed using a complex of
              proteins  called the transcriptional apparatus which requires access to DNA. 
              However, DNA is highly compacted by histone proteins.  To  investigate how DNA
              structure affects gene expression, this project  utilizes the bgl operon, a set
              of genes found in Escherichia coli.   Changes in DNA structure result in bgl
              expression.  When the bgl  operon is expressed, the bacterial cell can utilize
              beta-glucoside  sugars.  However, the bgl operon is silent in wild-type cells,
              and  therefore the cells cannot utilize these sugars.  A variety of  mutations
              cause the bgl operon to be expressed, including mutations  that affect proteins
              involved in twisting or supercoiling the DNA.  Mutations that affect the
              histone-like protein H-NS result in bgl  expression.  The goal of a genetic
              approach in analyzing bgl  expression is to identify all the genes and gene
              product involved  in the expression and the regulation of this operon.  To this
              end,  I have isolated a new regulatory gene, bglJ.  A mutation in this  gene
              results in bgl expression. My specific aims are to  characterize and to analyze
              the mechanism of the bglJ gene.   Characterization of bglJ will reveal whether
              bglJ encodes a novel  histone-like protein.  %%%  Studying bglJ expression may
              lead to better understanding of how  DNA structure affects gene expression in
              bacteria.  ***
