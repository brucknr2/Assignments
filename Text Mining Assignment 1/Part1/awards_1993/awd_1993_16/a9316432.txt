Abstract    :
              9316432  Blake  This renewal project will continue research on molecular 
              orbital calculations in the H-C-O-Al-Si-Na system in a  variety of chemical and
              hybridization states.  Work on  fitting the initial collection of results to an
              interatomic  potential known as the Universal Force Field for use in  silicate
              and oxide systems will be refined.  The research  will emphasize completion of
              very high level molecular  orbital calculations on small Si-containing oxide
              clusters  of varying coordination state and limited expansion of a  suite of
              simulations on the molecular interactions of  volatiles (primarily water and 
              carbon dioxide) in melts.  It will utilize computing facilities of the PI and
              the suite  of platforms available in the Materials Simulation Center at 
              California Institute of Technology.
