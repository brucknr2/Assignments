Abstract    :
              9316199  Guidotti       This award provides 63 percent of the funding required
              to  transport, install, and upgrade an electron microprobe. The  instrument is
              being donated to the Department of Geological  Sciences at the University of
              Maine by the U.S. Geological Survey.  The University of Maine is committed to
              providing the remaining  funds necessary for the installation and upgrade of
              this donated  electron microprobe.       The newly equipped electron microprobe
              laboratory at Maine  will be a regional facility serving Maine's research
              community with  a modern analytical tool suitable for a wide variety of
              research  projects where there is a need for accurate chemical compositional 
              data with high spatial resolution on the order of micrometers.  ***
