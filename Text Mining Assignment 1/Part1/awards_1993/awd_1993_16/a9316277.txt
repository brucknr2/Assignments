Abstract    :
              9316277  Johnson  The PIs propose to make a combined petrologic, geochemical, 
              Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope and conventional U/Pb zircon study of  granulite facies
              xenoliths from the Davis Mountains-Big Bend  region of west Texas and the
              Camargo basalt field in  Chihuahua, Mexico.  In addition, they will analyze
              garnet-  bearing metaigneous restites from Kilbourne Hole, New  Mexico, for
              their Hf isotope compositions.  Restites from  Kilbourne Hole and the other
              locations have only limited  variation in     Nd(0) but a wide range of
              176Lu/177Hf  ratios including extreme values (>0.5).  Hf model ages for 
              melt-extraction from garnet-bearing restites should be far  less ambiguous than
              model ages based on Nd.  This will be  the first systematic study of lower
              crustal xenoliths that  integrates Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf isotopes, and it will be
              by  far the most detailed conventional U/Pb zircon study to  date.  Although
              the immediate goal of this collaborative  effort is the study of the lower
              crust, U.C. Santa Cruz  workers will gain valuable experience at U.W. Madison
              in  state-of-the-art Hf isotope analysis, including joint  development of new
              standards and spikes.  This approach will  allow U.C. Santa Cruz to efficiently
              start-up a program in  Hf isotope work.
