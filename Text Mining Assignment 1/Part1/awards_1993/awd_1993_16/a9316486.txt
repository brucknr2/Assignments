Abstract    :
              9316486  Lasaga       This award provides one-half the funding required to
              purchase  computer equipment to be installed, operated and maintained in the 
              Department of Geology and Geophysics at Yale University. The  University is
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary  for the equipment
              acquisition.       The computer system will be used primarily by the
              geochemistry  group at Yale who are engaged in computer-intensive research on 
              modeling of erosion and geochemical cycles, quantum mechanical  calculations of
              silicates, kinetics of mineral dissolution and  surface adsorption, molecular
              dynamics of silicate glasses and  melts, Monte Carlo simulations of crystal
              growth and solution under  natural conditions, and studies of chemical
              reactions in  sedimentary basins and ore deposits.  ***
