Abstract    :
              9316008  Klemperer         In September, 1993 the Southern Sierra Nevada
              Continental  Dynamics (SSCD) project acquired "axial" (north-south) and 
              "transverse" (east-west) wide-angle reflection/refraction seismic  profiles
              across the southern Sierras and western Basin and Range  Province.  Based on
              modelling studies at Stanford, the SSCD  detonated and recorded four additional
              fan shots into the planned  receiver arrays.   One of the fundamental
              uncertainties about the  Sierra Nevada batholith is the extent of the root to
              this mountain  range; how thick (if it is present) and where (localized beneath
               the present mountains or also continuing east beneath the extended  fragments
              of the batholith in the western Basin and Range).  This  project involves
              support for one year of graduate student effort to  carry out three-dimensional
              modelling of the data that has been  collected.  If successful, the results of
              this project will shed  light on two fundamental issues of continental
              tectonics; the  crustal structure of batholiths, and the kinematics of
              extensional  tectonics.  ***
