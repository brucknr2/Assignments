Abstract    :
              9316349  Kohn  This study will employ laser probe oxygen isotope analysis  and a
              recently developed predictive model of mineral  isotopic changes during
              prograde metamorphism in an  intergrative effort to test whether there is a
              genetic  relationship between fluid infiltration and deformation  during
              metamorphism.  The relationship will be investigated  by obtaining oxygen
              isotope zoning profiles and/or maps for  both metamorphic porphyroblasts and
              matrix phases.  Three  different amphibolite-facies areas  (west-central New 
              Hampshire, southwestern New Hampshire, and Tierra del Fuwgo,  Chili) were
              selected for study because they are well  characterized with respect to their
              P-T, T-t and  deformational histories, and because they represent a range  of
              tectonic settings and fluid and deformational histories.
