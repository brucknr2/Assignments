Abstract    :
              9316582  Opdyke       PI, collaborator E. Irving, and colleagues in Australia
              will  conduct an accurate survey of the geomagnetic Kiaman events,  associated
              with a time of geomagnetic polarity stability.  Goals  are to test the
              synchroneity of the base of the Kiaman (worldwide),  establish its utility as a
              global stratigraphic marker, and attempt  to determine the broad-scale
              kinematics of Pangea's assembly.   Possible implications for idea of
              superplumes will be assessed.
