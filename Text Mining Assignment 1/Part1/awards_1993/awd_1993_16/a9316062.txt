Abstract    :
              9316062  Steele       This award provides two-thirds of the funds required to 
              purchase equipment for the purpose of upgrading the electron  microprobe
              instrument operated in the Department of Geophysical  Sciences at the
              University of Chicago. The institution is committed  to providing the remaining
              funds necessary to acquire the  equipment. Equipment items for the upgrade
              include a vacuum pump,  a synthetic layered X-ray monochromator for analyzing
              light  elements such as oxygen and fluorine, a back-scattered electron 
              detector, and an image display terminal. The University of Chicago  electron
              microprobe laboratory provides microanalytical  capabilities for a large number
              of student and faculty researchers  needing accurate chemical analyses of
              materials with a spatial  resolution in the micrometer range. The upgrade items
              are necessary  to match the instrument's capabilities with the extensive and 
              growing needs of a broad range of users.  ***
