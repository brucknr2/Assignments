Abstract    :
              9316597  Cerling    The carbon isotopic composition of paleosol carbonate and
              organic  matter can be used to estimate the concentration of CO2  of the 
              ancient atmosphere.  Preliminary results indicate that atmospheric  P(CO2) was
              less than 800 ppm V for most of the Tertiary, but was  significantly higher
              during the Mesozoic (2500 to 3000 ppm V).   This proposal is to continue to
              work on estimating the CO2 content  of the Paleozoic through Cenozoic
              paleoatmosphere.  We propose to  compare the results from paleosols in North
              America with those in  Europe and South America:  trends observed on all
              continents are  likely to be global trends.
