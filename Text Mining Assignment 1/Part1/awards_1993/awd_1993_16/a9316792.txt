Abstract    :
              IBN 93 16792  Thomson      Abstract    The components of an ecosystem are often
              related to each  other in amazing ways.  For example, the movement patterns  of
              bees foraging on flowers have substantial implications  for the pollination of
              the plants.  If individual bees  repeatedly visit a small number of plants in a
              small area,  gene flow will be restricted.  However, studying movement 
              patterns of bees has proven technically very difficult.  Dr.  Thomson will
              carry out experiments to determine the  feasibility of using video cameras to
              generate the data  needed to evaluate movement patterns and their consequences 
              in bees.  If successful, these methods will be applicable to  a variety of
              theoretical and applied problems.
