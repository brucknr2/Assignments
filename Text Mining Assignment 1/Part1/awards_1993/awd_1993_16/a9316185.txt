Abstract    :
              IBN 93-16185  Ryan    In order to fully understand a behavior in a biological 
              framework, it is necessary to understand the evolutionary  history of that
              behavior.  This is perhaps the most  difficult issue in behavioral research. 
              It requires  thorough knowledge of both the behavior of a group of  animals and
              the evolutionary relationships among the species  in the group.  Dr. Ryan's
              exciting work on this problem  combines sophisticated studies of animal
              communication with  detailed reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships. 
              This  combination of approaches will lead to a much better  understanding of
              how the behaviors involved in acoustic  communication evolve.
