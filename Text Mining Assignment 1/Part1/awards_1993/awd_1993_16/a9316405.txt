Abstract    :
              9316405  Chamberlain       An understanding of the driving forces for
              regional-scale  fluid flow requires knowledge of the relationship between
              thermal  and structural development of a collisional orogen and the  generation
              and flow of fluids.  This project will test a recent  model proposed for the
              Southern Alps of New Zealand that involves  large-scale hydrothermal systems
              produced by the rapid uplift  associated with continental collision.  The work
              will use stable  isotopic and geochronological data to test various predictions
              of  this model.  Results will help determine the timing and evolution  of the
              flow system and its relationship to the structural  development, and will have
              considerable impact in understanding  fluids in other orogens.
