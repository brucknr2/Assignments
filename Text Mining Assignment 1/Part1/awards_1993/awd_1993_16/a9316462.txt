Abstract    :
              9316462     Decelles       PI will study the fluvial architecture, detrital
              composition  and magnetostratigraphy of syntectonic, Paleocene-aged foreland- 
              basin sediments (Fort Union Formation) in NW Wyoming and SW  Montana.  Three
              main questions will be addressed:  1) What was the  geometry of the synorogenic
              fluvial system away from the  deformational front? 2) Do upsection changes in
              detrital  composition relect unroofing of the Beartooth Range, and what are 
              the proximal/distal effects compositional trends? and 3) What were  the rates
              of vertical sedimentological and petrofacies changes, and  of progradation of
              these facies into the basin?  This study will  produce a well-constrained,
              quantitative data-set of synorogenic  sedimentary features in a foreland basin,
              and thus provide  important values for use in modeling foreland-basin processes
              and  stratigraphy.
