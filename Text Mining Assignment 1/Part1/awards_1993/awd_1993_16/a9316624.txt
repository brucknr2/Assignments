Abstract    :
              9316624  Willsky       A new prognostic model of the global ocean circulation is
               being developed based on the Navier-Stokes equations, using  state-of-the-art
              parallel computers and languages with an  ultimate goal of creating a global
              ocean modeling/estimation tool  that can be used for climate research.  A key
              element of this  endeavor is the development of statistical estimation
              algorithms  for the assimilation of data into the forward model.  The  combined
              forward/estimation model could be used to estimate the  state of the ocean form
              observations constrained by dynamics.   The data of concern is sparse,
              heterogeneous and multiresolution  and the associated global ocean circulation
              models are of  gargantuan size, having upwards of 10 ~ 10 degrees of freedom.  
              The resulting estimation problem is of such a large size that  standard
              computational procedures become prohibitive. Novel  approaches to statistical
              modeling and the circulation models are  needed.  We proposed the first steps
              in this direction through  the establishment of a collaboration involving
              physical  oceanographers and probabilistic modeling and statistical  inference
              specialists.  The short term focal point of this  collaboration is the
              definition and solution of a series of  subproblems designed to foster
              understanding insight, and mutual  communication and in the process advance the
              state of the art in  both data assimilation for global ocean modeling and
              statistical  modeling and estimation of random fields.  ***
