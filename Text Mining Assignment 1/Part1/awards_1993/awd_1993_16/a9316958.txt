Abstract    :
              9316958  Morison  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program 
              ("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the
              eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B.
              Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here concerns long
              time series measurements of upper ocean  temperature, salinity, and current
              speed from a drifting buoy  anchored to the sea ice.  The buoy will monitor the
              seasonal  evolution of the air-sea-ice system in the central Weddell Sea, 
              which cannot be assessed in the time that the ship is present.  In  particular
              the buoy measurements will provide data on the  cumulative impact of storms or
              significant wind events passing over  the station.  ***
