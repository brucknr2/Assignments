Abstract    :
                   This proposal has two primary segments.  The first is  devoted to various
              topics in statistical mechanics,  including photochemical experiments on DNA
              and zeolite,  finite size scaling, self organized criticality, directed 
              percolation, and nonequilibrium phenomena.  The second  concerns a study of the
              quantum measurement problem, and  also some applications of Feynman path
              integrals.  ***
