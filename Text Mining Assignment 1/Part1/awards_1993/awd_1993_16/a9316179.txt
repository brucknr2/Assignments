Abstract    :
              9316179  Leibacher      This award will support the participation of ten U.S.
              senior and  junior scientists to participate in a workshop on helioseismology 
              and the internal structure of the Sun to be held in Sydney,  Australia in
              mid-January 1994.  The American coordinator is   Dr. John Leibacher from the
              National Optical Astronomy  Observatories / National Solar Observatory.  The
              Australian  coordinator is Prof. Peter Wilson of the University of Sydney. 
              This workshop is being conducted under the U.S. - Australia  Cooperative
              Science Program and support in Australia is provided  through the Department of
              Industry, Technology and Regional  Development (DITARD).    Helioseismology,
              the study of acoustic oscillations trapped in  resonant cavities within the
              Sun, is a new and exciting field  that promises to provide a means of measuring
              the characteristics  of the internal structure and dynamics of the Sun. The NSF
              -  sponsored Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project will  deploy a
              network of six oscillation observing stations around the  world beginning in
              1994.  These stations will keep the Sun under  surveillance 24 hours each day
              over a three year period. One of  these stations will be located at the
              Learmonth Solar Observatory  in Western Australia.    The object of this
              workshop is to increase the participation of  Australian scientists in
              helioseismology and to initiate  cooperative research programs.  The workshop
              will be divided  between tutorial presentations by recognized experts and 
              traditional research presentations.  The principal topics will be  the physics
              of solar oscillations, solar internal models,  convection, dynamos, and
              helioseismic inversions.  ***
