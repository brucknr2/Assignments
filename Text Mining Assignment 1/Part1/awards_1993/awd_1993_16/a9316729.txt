Abstract    :
              9316729  Strausfeld    Some insect species have in their brain a complex
              anatomical  structure called the mushroom body, which has been linked to 
              learning and behavior.  This SGER work explores the hypothesis that  the
              mushroom bodies provide a network of connections, a multiplex  neuropile, that
              mediates visual place memory.  The novel approach  is to work out "gene
              expression neuroanatomy" along with behavior  in the fruitfly, Drosophila, with
              its well-known genetics.  Gene  expression will be used to define genetic
              subsets of neurons in the  mushroom bodies, genetic crosses of Drosophila with
              behavioral  deficits will be made, and the existence of visual place memory 
              will be tested.  There is some risk whether genetic tools will be  successful
              in clarifying the neuroanatomy, and will be able to  provide a link to the
              visual memory mechanisms.   The results will  be important beyond the issues of
              invertebrate central  neuroanatomy, in providing a framework for future genetic
              and  systematic studies of complex memory circuits at the cellular  level.  
              This work will have an impact on sensory neurobiology,  insect research in
              general, learning and memory, and evolutionary  studies.   ***
