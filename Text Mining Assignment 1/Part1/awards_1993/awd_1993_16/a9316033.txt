Abstract    :
              9316033  Butler       Most models of the tectonic evolution of the Appalachians 
              involve stages of subduction accompanied by collision.  Until the  recent
              discovery of eclogite, evidence of the high-pressure  metamorphism typical of
              subduction or collision zones was lacking  in the southern Appalachians.  This
              project is an in-depth study of  the ecologite in the North Carolina Blue
              Ridge, and will provide  structural-petrologic-chronlogic data for developing
              models for the  evolution of the Blue Ridge, in particular the emplacement and 
              tectonic relationships of oceanic crust on the Laurentian craton.
