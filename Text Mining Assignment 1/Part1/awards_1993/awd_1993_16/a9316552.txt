Abstract    :
              Abstract  Keller  9316552  To identify the DNA sequences that coordinate
              flagellar gene  expression, the genes for @ 1 tubulin and RSP 3, another
              flagellar  protein, have been modified for identification, deleted to retain 
              varying lengths of 5' and 3' flanking regions and intervening  sequences, and
              introduced into Chlamydomonas cells.  Expression of  the modified genes is
              being analyzed in control and stimulated  cells.  An element regulating
              expression of the @ 1 tubulin gene  has been located by correlating loss of
              inducibility with specific  deletions, and the function of this and other
              putative regulatory  elements will be correlated with specific responses to
              stimulation.   This characterization of possibly multiple DNA control elements 
              regulating Chlamydomonas flagellar gene expression will add to our  general
              understanding of coordinate gene expression and organelle  biogenesis.  ***  In
              eukaryotes, mechanisms that coordinately regulate expression of  functionally
              related but structurally distinct genes are largely  unknown.  The
              Chlamydomonas flagellar regeneration system is ideal  for studying coordinate
              gene induction.  Stimulation of cells  causes detachment of Chlamydomonas
              flagella, and rapidly and  transiently induces transcription of tubulin and
              other flagellar  genes 10-20 fold above basal levels of expression.  Our
              previous  work suggests that flagellar gene expression is regulated by Ca2+  
              -controlled events associated with flagellar regeneration -  cellular
              stimulation, flagellar excision, and flagellar regrowth.   To determine if the
              flagellar genes are coordinately induced by  each of these events, we will
              measure mRNA abundance changes of an  expanded set of flagellar genes after
              stimulation in conditions  that uncouple the normal program of events.  Results
              of these  studies will indicate whether the flagellar genes are coordinately 
              induced through similar or distinct control mechanisms.  %%%
