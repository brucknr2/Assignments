Abstract    :
              9316970  Ghose  The principal objective of this exploratory research program  is
              to study the structure and dynamics of magnesium silicate  melts by in situ
              laser Raman spectroscopy with simultaneous  CO2 laser heating to temperatures
              of ~3000oK  The  experiments involve creation of a localized melt in a 
              magnesium silicate glass or crystal plate using a CO2 laser  beam - with the
              glass or crystal plate to act as the  crucible for the localized melt.  Raman
              scattering data from  the melt area will be interpreted from conventional and 
              quantum molecular dynamics simulations based on large atomic  clusters.  A good
              match of the experimentally observed and  theoretically calculated vibrational
              spectra and radial  distribution functions will ensure the correctness of the 
              derived melt structures, which in turn will be used to  calculate their
              thermodynamic and physical properties,  including viscosity.
