Abstract    :
              9316018  Subramani      Peroxisomes are ubiquitous subcellular organelles 
              present in most eukaryotic cells.  They house a large array  of enzymes
              intimately involved in lipid metabolism.  The  long-term goal of the work
              described here is to identify the  protein components and to elucidate the
              mechanism by which  matrix and membrane proteins are targeted to the
              peroxisome.  Two peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1 and PTS2) have  already
              been implicated in the transport of matrix proteins  to peroxisomes.  Little is
              known regarding the signals that  target membrane proteins to the organelle. 
              The first goeal  of this proposal is to elucidate the signal that targets 
              proteins to the peroxisomal membrane.  An understanding of  the mechanism of
              peroxisomal protein import requires the  ability to investigate the steps in an
              in vitro system.  A  cytosol-dependent permeabilized Chinese hamster ovary cell
               system has been developed for PTS1-containing proteins.  The  second goal of
              the proposal is the identification and  purification of mammalian cytosolic
              components and  peroxisomal membrane proteins required for import of PTS1 
              containing proteins.  %%%  The name "peroxisome" derives from the fact that the
              enzymes  that produce and degrade hydrogen peroxide are localized in  this
              organelle.  However, perooxisomes also contain all or  part of several other
              biochemical pathways.  Part of the  problem in assigning a single predominant
              function to this  organelle is that the content of peroxisomal proteins varies 
              between organisms, cell types and the environment of the  cell or organism. 
              Therefore, the studies proposed here will  result in a greater understanding of
              the mechanisms involved  in the biogenesis of this important organelle.  ***
