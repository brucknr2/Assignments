Abstract    :
              9316125  Fluck    The PI and his students will continue to study the roles of 
              cytoskeletal systems and cytosolic calcium pulses, waves, and  gradients in
              ooplasmic movements and cytokinesis in the medaka egg.   The objectives of the
              research are:  a) to describe the spatial and  temporal organization of
              microtubules during ooplasmic segregation;  b) to determine whether
              microtubules and a microtubule-associated  motor (kinesin) are involved in the
              segregation of a specific class  of cytoplasmic organelles (oil droplets)
              toward the vegetal pole of  the cell, c) to determine whether the artificial
              induction of a  cytosolic calcium gradient will organize ooplasmic segregation,
              d)  to determine whether there is a causal relationship between zones  of
              elevated calcium and microtubule organization, e) to determine  whether calcium
              pulses, waves, or gradients accompany specific  mitotic and cytokinetic events,
              and f) to determine whether  dissipation of cytosolic calcium gradients near
              the developing  cleavage furrow will inhibit cytokinesis.  %%%  Dr. Fluck and
              his students will continue to study the mechanisms by  which structural
              rearrangements and cell division take place in  fertilized eggs.  The egg of
              the medaka fish provide an excellent  system for these studies.  In particular
              they will study the roles  of the internal skeletal structures of cells
              (cytoskeletal systems)  and pulses, waves and gradients of intracellular
              calcium in  regulating the movements of the egg's internal structure, and in 
              the division of the egg into two daughter cells.  The results of  these studies
              will give us important new insight into the  physiological and structural bases
              of these two critical events in  the early development of a fertilized egg.
