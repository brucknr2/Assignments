Abstract    :
              9316504  Baumgartner  The project involves a three-year integrated field, 
              geochemical and modelling study to illuminate the  crystallization history of
              siliceous marbles in the Ubehebe  Peak (Death Valley, California) contact
              aureole.  Detailed  outcrop and aureole scale maps of mineral occurrence 
              (isograd maps), abundance and textures will be made for the  siliceous dolomite
              mineral assemblages.  This data set will  be complemented with stable isotope
              and trace element  geochemistry of carbonate and silicate minerals within the 
              siliceous dolomite units.  Initial interpretations will  employ simple
              one-dimensional models to identify promising  outcrops for further study.  A
              2-D finite element model will  be developed which will account for
              variable-density fluid  flow, conductive and advective heat transfer, stable
              isotope  exchange, and simple mineral reactions in the siliceous  dolomite
              system.  Results of the study will ultimately lead  to qualitative
              understanding of the evolution of the  hydrothermal system associated with the
              cooling of the  intrusion.
