Abstract    :
              9316098  Pollard       Faults that developed at about 10 km depth will be
              examined to  better understand the formation, evolution and processes
              associated  with faults in the deeper portions of the earths crust.  Field work
               will focus on small faults in the Sierra Nevada, and will  characterize fault
              geometry, to be interpreted with continuum  mechanics.  The outcome should be a
              better understanding of  nucleation and growth of faults.
