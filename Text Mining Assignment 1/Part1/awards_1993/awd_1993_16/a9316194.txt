Abstract    :
              9316194  Ma    The long term goal of these studies is to understand the 
              molecular mechanisms controlling flower development in  Arabidopsis.  Three
              specific aims are identified:  (1) The  PI will analyze agamous (AG) function
              using inducible  promoter fusions.  The focus will be on already generated 
              transgenic plants that carry fusions of AG with a heatshock  promoter.  The PI
              will perform temperature shift experiments  at different times and study the
              effects of such treatment.  (2)  The PI will identify and characterize AG
              binding sites.  He has characterized in vitro DNA binding with wild-type AG 
              proteins.  He will use the DNA binding assays to  characterize several AG
              truncation mutant proteins which he  has expressed in E. coli.  He will also
              test one point  mutant that causes a very interesting ag-like phenotype in 
              transgenic plants.  The PI also plans to test DNA binding in  yeast and will
              use this system to analyze different AG  target sites, including those from the
              AGL1 gene.  (3)  The  PI will test possible AG target genes, using in vitro and
              in  vivo assays to study AG binding to potential AG-binding  sites in the 5'
              AGL1 untranscribed region and in the large  AGL1 intron.  Sites identified in
              vitro will be further  analyzed in yeast and in transgenic plants using
              reporter  gene constructs.  These studies will further our  understanding of AG
              function during flower development,  particularly its role as a transcriptional
              regulator of  genes in a regulatory hierarchy.  ***
