Abstract    :
              9316815  Hess    The Karst Waters Institute proposes to sponsor a conference on 
              Breakthroughs in Karst Geomicrobiology and Redox Geochemistry  February 16-19,
              1994 in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  The conference  will bring together karst
              and other scientists with hydrological,  biological, geological, chemical and
              geomorphological backgrounds  focusing on the role of microorganisms in both
              geological and  biological processes with an emphasis on karst.  Topics to be 
              covered include: 1) Redox Environments in Karst, 2) Role of  Microorganisms in
              Karst Processes, 3) Energy, Chemoautotrophy, and  Thermodynamics in Microbial
              Systems, 4) Sulfate/Sulfide/Carbonate  Speleogenesis, 5) microbial Mediation of
              Carbonate Precipitation  and 6) Comparison of Microbial Systems in Karst to
              those Elsewhere  and in the Fossil record.  Twelve karst and other scientists
              have  been invited from around the world to give keynote addresses and  chair
              the various sessions.  The conference will be three days in  length.  The first
              and third days will be devoted to keynote  addresses and invited and
              volunteered papers.  On the evening of  the first day there will be a post1er
              session and reception.  The  second day will be devoted to a field trip and
              workshops on field  and laboratory techniques in geomicrobiology.  Keynote
              speakers,  session chairs and most presenters have been personally invited to 
              participate in the conference.  The conference is being advertised  in several
              professional outlets including Geotimes, GSA Today, EOS  and The Bulletin of
              the Ecological Society of America.  All  abstracts will be published in the
              conference program.  Contributed  papers are planned to be published in a
              special issue of  Geomicrobiology.  Meeting summaries will be submitted to
              various  appropriate professional outlets.  ***
