Abstract    :
              CTS-9316096  Tufts University  Gregory Botsaris    The objective of the proposed
              research on crystallization is the development of a new theory to explain
              kinetic data from industrial crystallizers at intermediate or relatively high
              supersaturations under conditions where neither primary nucleation nor contact
              secondary nucleation is dominant.  The approach combines theories on colloidal
              suspension with those of nucleation by focusing on embryos or clusters which
              are below a critical size for spontaneous, isolated growth.  Integrated,
              inverse power representation of attractive forces among embryos and between
              embryos and seed crystals will be evaluated as a basis for determining embryo
              concentrations near a crystal.  Particle kinetic growth models are to describe
              agglomeration or coagulation.  Theoretical findings will be compared with
              experimental observations.    Crystallization is a very important separation
              process which is used to purify many compounds in the food, chemical and
              pharmaceutical industries.  Results from his project should improve quality of
              many products as well as lower cost.
