Abstract    :
              9316235  Platz  The Workshop on Physical Organic Chemistry, an annual  
              conference for the discussion of topics that span from   biorganic chemistry to
              gas-phase reactions, will be convened   for the next three years. Although the
              range of topics is   wide, all have the methodology used by physical organic  
              chemists. Attendance will be limited to about twenty   persons, all of whom
              present informal talks on new,   unpublished results. Conferences will be held
              at remote   sites in order to minimize distractions and encourage   informal
              discussion. Strong efforts will be made, as in the   past, to include
              minorities and females. In keeping with   past tradition, there will be a large
              number of younger   investigators along with some senior investigators.  %%% 
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing meeting
              of Workshops on Physical Organic   Chemistry, which is organized by Professor
              Matthew S. Platz   at Ohio State University. These workshops will provide  
              opportunities for the generation of new ideas, to facilitate   collaborate, and
              to introduce young investigators to their   senior peers. The number of
              attendees and location of the   meetings are designed to facilitate these
              goals. The   workshop also benefits the Organic Dynamics Program by  
              identifying imaginative research projects and young   investigators that will
              strengthen the Program as new   awardees and reviewers.  ***
