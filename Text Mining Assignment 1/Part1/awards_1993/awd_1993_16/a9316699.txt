Abstract    :
              9316699  Lanier       This award provides 70% of the funds required to purchase
              a  petrographic microscope system for the use of faculty and students  in the
              Department of Earth Sciences at Emporia State University.  The institution is
              committed to providing the remaining funds  necessary to acquire the equipment.
              The award is made under the  guidelines of the National Science Foundation's
              Research in  Undergraduate Institutions program. The equipment is needed in 
              research projects in sedimentology and micropaleontology and  undergraduates
              will be actively involved in using the microscope  equipment to contribute to
              research in these projects.  ***
