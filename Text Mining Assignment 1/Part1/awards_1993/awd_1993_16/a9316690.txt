Abstract    :
              9136690  Hickey-Vargas       This award provides one-half the funds required to
              upgrade an  inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer in the 
              Geology Department at Florida International University. The  University is
              committed to providing the additional funds necessary  for the upgrade. The
              instrument is used in the department's  research and teaching programs for
              rapid and accurate chemical  analysis of geochemical samples, mostly rock,
              mineral, and water.  The upgrade will improve the limits of detection for
              certain  elements critical for current research projects.  ***
