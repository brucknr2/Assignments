Abstract    :
              9316889  Bock      The PI and his postdoctoral associate will analyze their 1992
              and 1993 GPS regional measurements from Sumatra and other islands in the
              Indonesian archipelago to study crustal deformation along the Sumatran fault
              and the forearc region to the southwest.  Continuous improvements in GPS
              satellite constellation, receiver technology and global tracking networks
              permit significantly more accurate estimates of surface deformation for these
              two years than for any of the preceding three years.  In this way, they can
              assess qualitatively and quantitatively the decoupling of oblique slip along
              this plate margin into normal subduction and shear slip.  They will also
              analyze repeated GPS measurements collected from 1990 through 1993 along five
              fault transects.  These small scale linear arrays complement the regional
              network by providing a detailed picture of the near-fault strain field at
              various fault segments.  ****
