              Drescher, J.            MCNC Center for Communication  High speed computer
              networks support shared databases and new modes of collaboration in several
              scientific areas.  These capabilities have yet to be widely applied at the
              state level. The MCNC Center for Communication is convening a planning workshop
              which will convene people from each state to provide information about the
              National Research and Education Network (NREN).  They request support for a
              workshop to plan a framework for how the states could best invest in an
              interoperable network that would take full advantage of the resources and
              capabilities that the NREN has to offer.  Network capabilities and database and
              conferencing technology such as dial up video service would demonstrated in
              this two day workshop.  This conference will bring together many academic and
              government representatives from the numerous states and from the networking
              technology community who are essential for the design, development, deployment,
              and operation of a robust, high performance computer network.  This effort is
              in step with federal initiatives in high performance computing and its plans to
              meet pressing needs for improved research collaboration and productivity in the
              United States.
