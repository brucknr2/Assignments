Abstract    :
              9316435  Gilbert    This research is the application of new modeling strategies
              to  problems in global seismology which have proven difficult to solve  using
              conventional techniques.  The problems of concern are highly  nonlinear and/or
              have multiple solution minima, which makes  gradient techniques unusable and
              general search techniques  prohibitively expensive.  Developments based on
              analogies with  optimization in naturally occurring systems are leading to 
              practical algorithms which can efficiently search model space.   This class of
              algorithms includes simulated annealing, genetic  algorithms, and evolutionary
              programming.  The algorithms will be  applied to two specific problems:
              spherically symmetric earth  models from datasets of free-oscillation
              measurements, and waveform  modeling of 1-D and 3-D structure.  ***
