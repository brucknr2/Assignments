Abstract    :
              9316022  Loeblich  This work contributes to documentation of biodiversity and
              ecology  of one of the major faunal groups in Earth's oceans.  PI and A.R. 
              Loeblich, Jr. have completed a monograph on the exceptionally  diverse
              foraminiferal fauna of the Timor Sea northwest of  Australia; this research was
              supported by several NSF awards in the  1980s, and is part of a series of
              historically NSF-funded studies  on the Timor Sea and Sahul Shelf.  The
              monograph describes and  illustrates 940 foraminiferal species, included 97 new
              ones, and  almost 900 of which have not previously been illustrated.  The 
              fauna represent water depths of 20 m to nearly 3500 m, and thus  this work will
              also be a primary reference for future benthic  foraminiferal studies.
