Abstract    :
              9316611  Smithson       This award provides one-half the funding needed for the 
              acquisition of a high-resolution reflection seismograph system to  be used in
              basic research on seismic reflection methods applied to  imaging the upper
              crust. The instrument system will be operated by  the Department of Geology and
              Geophysics at the University of  Wyoming. The University is committed to
              providing the remaining  funds necessary for the purchase of the equipment.    
                The seismic reflection method is the most effective means of  imaging the
              subsurface, but common seismic recording equipment does  not have the
              capability of recording the high-frequencies (to 100  Hz) needed to achieve
              high-resolution images. The new system will  be used by the reflection
              seismology group at the University of  Wyoming to obtain improved images of
              shallow crustal structures.  ***
