Abstract    :
              9316621  Graham    This study will examine heart-chamber functions in
              elasmobranchs  (sharks and rays) and bony fishes.  In fishes the heart
              structure  consists of a single tube that is divided into four "in-series" 
              chambers, the sinus venosus, the atrium, the ventricle, and the  conus or
              bulbus arteriosus.  In sharks, all of these, including the  conus, are
              contractile whereas in most bony fishes, the bulbus is  elastic.  The cardiac
              chamber arrangement in fishes differs from  that of mammals, including man,
              where there are four chambers (two  atria, two ventricles) arranged in
              parallel.  This study will  examine atrial and ventricular interactions during
              the cardiac  cycle in both sharks (hornshark) and teleost (halibut) fishes.  
              Because of the parallel arrangement of chambers in mammals, study  of chamber
              interaction is complicated by the actions of the four  separate contractile
              elements that share a common central heart  wall.  Fishes thus offer the
              advantage of simpler, in-series  chamber dynamics and this allows
              quantification of  chamber-interaction effects on the volume and efficiency of
              the  cardiac pump.  Several other fish-heart features make it an  important
              model for the mammal heart function and will be  investigated in this study. 
              Fishes have a spongy inner myocardial  wall, as opposed to the smooth wall of
              mammals.  Also, sharks  differ from teleosts in having a contractile conus as
              opposed to an  elastic bulbus.  Finally, sharks lack a sympathetic cardiac 
              innervation which parallels the condition in cardiac transplant  patients.  ***
