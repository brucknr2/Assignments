Abstract    :
              9316460  Kastner       This award provides 72% of the funds required for the 
              acquisition of a heating and freezing stage for optical microscopy  of fluid
              inclusions in rock and mineral samples. The equipment will  be installed and
              operated in the Geological Research Division of  the Scripps Institute of
              Oceanography at the University of  California, San Diego. The institution is
              committed to providing  the remaining funds necessary to acquire the instrument
              system.       Research to be conducted with this apparatus includes the  study
              of fluid inclusions in rocks brought up from the mantle and  in ancient oceanic
              accretionary complexes. The interpretation of  such fluid inclusions yields
              information regarding the nature and  origin of fluids trapped in the mantle
              and on the evolution of the  chemistry of ancient oceans.  ***
