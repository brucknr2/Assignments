Abstract    :
              9316860  Horodyski       PI will continue to search for and study fossils of 
              Proterozoic metazoans and metaphytes (multicellular animals and  plants);
              fossils in the Belt Supergroup (Montana) and the Wood  Canyon Formation
              (Nevada) will be the principal focus.  The goal is  to gain a better
              understanding of major biological innovations that  occurred during Middle and
              Late Proterozoic time, about 1.5 to 0.5  billion years ago.
