Abstract    :
              This award supports a collaborative marine geological and  geophysical project
              between the University of California, Santa  Barbara, and the University of
              Alabama to study the glacial and  tectonic history of the eastern Ross Sea and
              the Marie Byrd Land  margin of West Antarctica.  The goals of the project are
              (1) to  conduct seismic imaging and piston coring to begin unraveling the 
              history of the West Antarctic ice Sheet as recorded in the recent  sediments of
              the continental shelf of the region, and (2) to  acquire seismic images of the
              acoustic basement beneath the  Cenozoic glacial deposits toward an
              understanding of the  relationship between rift structure of the continental
              crust and  Cenozoic glacial deposits of the region.  This research will result 
              in bathymetric, structural, sediment isopach, gravity and magnetic  maps of the
              eastern Ross Sea and the Marie Byrd Land margin.  This  information will be
              integrated into an interpretation of the major  glacial and structural features
              of the region.  This project will  result in a better understanding of the
              glacio-marine stratigraphy  and glacial history of the eastern Ross Sea and
              Marie Byrd Land  margin and, consequently, it will represent a significant 
              contribution to the goals of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  initiative.
