Abstract    :
              9316166  Harrison  This project proposes experiments that will lead to a better 
              understanding of monazite as a thermochronometer.  Monazite  was selected for
              study because its retentive nature for Pb*  and its unusual (for an accessory
              mineral) behavior during  diagenesis suggests its use as a system capable of 
              continuously recording thermochronological information  during prograde
              metamorphism of a pelite.   Three distinct,  but ultimately interconnected,
              studies are required to  exploit this observation:  development of U-Th-Pb 
              microanalysis for monazite, the stability and reaction  kinetics of LREE oxides
              in pelitic assemblages, and Pb  diffusion in monazite.  These studies will lead
              to  utilization of the Th-Pb system to date discrete reaction  events in the
              heating phase of orogenic terranes as well as  a refined knowledge of the
              closure temperature for Pb in  monazie.
