Abstract    :
              9316565  Cramer  The objective of the project is to obtain deeper insight into 
              physical mechanisms of the charge transfer processes in  biological membranes,
              in particular electron transfer in  membrane-bound cytochromes and polar amino
              acid translocation  across membranes.  Physico-chemical experimental and
              theoretical  studies of spectra, electrochemistry, and kinetics of model 
              proteins and heme complexes would be combined with biochemical,  biophysical
              crystallographic, and molecular biological analysis  of the structure-function
              of photosynthetic electron transport  proteins (cytochromes) and ion
              translocation of a bacterial ion  channel (colicin).  The problems whose
              understanding will be  advanced as a result of these studies are as follows: 
              the  specific features of the dielectric reorganization of proteins  and their
              surroundings in biological charge transfer processes;  the mechanism of
              electron transfer in cytochromes including  effects of electrostatic fields on
              the heme redox potentials,  inner-sphere reorganization, reorganization of
              dielectric  environment (membrane core, lipid heads), and electronic coupling 
              via alpha-helices; mechanism of docking and electron transfer in  the
              cytochrome f-plastocyanin system; the physical basis of the  "cis-positive
              rule," describing orientation of intramembrane  proteins; mechanism of
              trans-membrane channel formation by  colicin and related toxin-like molecules. 
              %%%  The object of the project is to obtain a better understanding of  the
              mechanism by which electrical charge is transferred or  prevented from being
              transferred in the membranes that border and  contain biological materials. 
              The processes of charge movement  in membranes are closely related to the
              mechanisms of cellular  energy storage that take place in these membranes, and
              of the  translocation of proteins across membranes that is associated  with in
              the assembly of cellular structures and of the membranes  themselves.  ***
