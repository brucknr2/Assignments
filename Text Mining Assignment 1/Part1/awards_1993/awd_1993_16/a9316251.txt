Abstract    :
              9316251  Reed  Support is requested to assist academic personnel, particularly
              younger researchers and graduate students, who are engaged in Micro Electro
              Mechanical Systems (MEMS) research by providing either wholly or partially for
              travel to and subsistence at the 1994 IEEE Micro Electro Mechanical Systems
              Workshop, which is to be held in Oiso, Japan, January 25-28, 1994.    The 1994
              MEMS Workshop is an international research meeting, seventh in a series begun
              in 19987 (originally entitled "IEEE Micro Robots and Teleoperators Workshop"). 
              The site of the 1994 MEMS Workshop is in Japan; this will place a financial
              stress on established as well as new academic entrants in the field.  Adequate
              funds for attendance at the 1994 MEMS Workshop is therefore not included in the
              budgets of many, particularly younger, researchers.  Likewise, adequate travel
              money is often not in the budgets of some of the more established advisors
              whose students would benefit by attending.  The presence of these researchers
              and students would enhance the value of the meeting to the engineering and
              scientific community in the United States.  ***
