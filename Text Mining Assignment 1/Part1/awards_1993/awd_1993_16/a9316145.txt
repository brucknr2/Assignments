Abstract    :
              9316145  Haarer  The ability of profilin to block phospholiphase C activity by 
              binding to PIP2 and the observation that overexpression of profilin  can
              suppress defects in yeast CAP (adenylate cyclase-associated  protein) suggest
              that profilin may aid in the conveyance of growth  screen has been used to
              identify five mutations that result in cell  death only when combined with an
              altered profilin.  These  "synthetic lethal" mutations are likely to define
              genes whose  products interact with profilin, or that provide similar
              functions.   To identify the specific functions of these genes and to define 
              their interactions with profilin, the following genetic and  biochemical
              studies will be performed: 1) Characterization of  profilin synthetic lethal
              (ps1) mutants.  2) Cloning of profilin  synthetic lethal genes and analysis of
              their protein products.  3)  Investigation of the PSL1 gene product and
              associated proteins.  %%%%  The long-term goals of this project address several
              basic cell  biological questions using yeast as a model experimental organism: 
              i) how does the cell establish polarity; ii)what signals convey  this
              decision-making process to those components of the cell that  are responsible
              for carrying out the necessary morphological  changes; and iii) once this
              message is conveyed, how are  morphological changes controlled in an orderly
              fashion? More  specifically, this project strives to identify the role of the 
              actin-binding protein profilin in cell growth.  ***
