Abstract    :
              9316047  Van Schmus    The formation of Gondwana during late Precambrian to
              Early   Paleozoic times represents one of the major assemblies of a large 
              continent in geologic history.  This event fused several Archean to  Early
              Proterozoic cratonic masses, continental fragments and  marginal orogenic belts
              of Africa and South America during the 600  My Pan African-Brasiliano orogeny. 
              This project continues efforts  to define the crustal history of the Borborema
              Province in the  northeastern Brazilian shield prior to the formation of
              Gondwana by  developing a precise chronology for assembly of the diverse 
              lithospheric elements.  The data obtained, along with studies  underway by
              other groups in Brazil and Africa will provide better  understanding of the
              ancestry and assembly of western Gondwana.  ***
