Abstract    :
              9316739  Voight  The proposed research focuses on debris flows and is  intended
              as a contribution to the Decade Volcano Program of  the International Decade of
              Natural Disaster Reduction  (IDNDR).  It has the general objectives to enhance
              our  understanding of past sector-collapses via characterization  of deposits
              and reconstruction of source areas, and to  improve our understanding of
              mechanisms of transformation of  debris avalanche to cohesive debris flows. 
              These objectives  will be met through detailed study of megaclast and matrix 
              facies relationships in flow deposits, and detailed  megaclast mapping of
              lithologies, igneous structures, key  alteration minerals, and textures.  A
              primary task of the  proposed research is to characterize the megaclasts and 
              adjacent matrix in the Greenwater Lahar-Osceola Mudflow  deposit.  The study
              should significantly contribute to our  understanding of cohesive debris flow
              processes and hazards  at Mount Rainier and similar volcanoes worldwide.
