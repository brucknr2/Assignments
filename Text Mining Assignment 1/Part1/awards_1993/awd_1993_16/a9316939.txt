Abstract    :
              9316939  White            The focus of this research is the discovery of new
              synthetic   methods and their application to the synthesis of certain  
              carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds of natural origin. Five   natural
              products are identified for the purpose of defining the   specific goals of the
              project. They fall into two groups, one   consisting of a set for which bond
              reorganization involving a   cyclobutane is the focal step, and another in
              which elaboration   of a heterocyclic subunit plays a pivotal role. The first
              group   contains rubratoxin B, verrucarol, and huperzine A. The second   group
              contains the alkaloids cylindrospermopsin and koumine.   The major emphasis in
              all of the syntheses is the ability to   complete efficient routes to
              structures containing a high   degree of complexity.  %%%  With this award, the
              Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. James D. White of
              the Department of   Chemistry at Oregon State University. Professor White will 
               focus his work on the discovery of new synthetic methods and   their
              application to the synthesis of certain carbocyclic and   heterocyclic
              compounds of natural origins. The molecular   architecture of the designated
              target compounds presents a   significant challenge to contemporary methods of
              synthesis   which will be addressed by exploring unconventional and, in  
              several instances, unprecedented approaches to their   construction.  ***
