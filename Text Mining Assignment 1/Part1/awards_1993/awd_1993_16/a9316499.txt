Abstract    :
              9316499  Elders         This project involves the coordination of the
              participation of  U.S. scientists in an international consortium from New
              Zealand,  Japan and the USA which will carry out shallow research drilling on 
              White Island, which is one of the world's most active, but  accessible,
              andesite volcanoes.  White Island is in the Bay of  Plenty at the northern
              extension of the Taupo Volcanic Zone of New  Zealand.  Unlike other frequently
              active volcanoes, such as Kilauea  and Etna, it is a "wet" system, i.e., its
              behavior is dominated by  the interaction of shallow magma with meteoric water.
               As this  system is highly compressed relative to those found in typical 
              high-relief volcanoes, by drilling to depths of only hundreds of  meters on
              White Island, it will be possible to study and directly  sample the interface
              between an andesite magma and a geothermal  system.  ***
