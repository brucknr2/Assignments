Abstract    :
              9316207  Boyle  PIs have found iridium (Ir) anomalies in ice cores associated
              with  the 1908 Tunguska event and the 1783 Laki eruption.  In  collabooration
              with Robert Rocchia (Paris), they will extend these  analyses to other ice
              cores with the following goals:  1) test and  verify findings, 2) make
              systematic studies on ice core samples to  clarify partitioning of Ir, and 3)
              investigate temporal variability   of background Ir deposition.  Results have
              implications for debate  over impact vs. volcanic sources for iridium in the
              stratigraphic  record, and also for linking volcanism and impacts to climatic 
              changes.
