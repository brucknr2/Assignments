Abstract    :
              9316105  Saleeby       The emplacement of large batholiths in compressional
              setting  raises classic arguments about how space requirements are met, and 
              the degree to which batholiths create their air space.  This  proposal will
              investigate the suggestion that a set of ductile  shear zones from the southern
              Sierra Nevada batholith may represent  deformation related to pluton
              emplacement dynamics which are linked  kinematically to the Tehachapi-Rand
              thrust system.  A test of this  hypothesis involves establishing a firm
              physical and temporal link  between the shear zones and the thrust system. 
              Results will help  resolve the local debate, and as the Sierra Nevada is
              commonly  regarded as the type exposure of a batholithic belt, they will have 
              importance generally.
