Abstract    :
              9361780  Ghosal      Efficient, environmentally stable, easily processable and 
              cost effective semiconducting materials are needed from fabrication of light
              emitting diodes to be used in large area displays and density optical
              recording.  The proposed Phase I research utilizes copolymers to fabricate
              visible light emitters made of novel organic polymer composites.  Constituents
              of the proposed composite material can be varied to achieve desired efficiency
              of light emission, low voltage of operation, required brightness, and other
              important operational parameters.  the flexibility and ease of the proposed
              material's processing technique enables route to inexpensive, reconfigurable
              and high pixel density displays.  The future benefits of the proposed
              structures are: (i) high quantum efficiency of the light emission, (ii)
              controllable chromaticity, (iii) low voltage of operation, and (iv) long time
              reliability.  ***
