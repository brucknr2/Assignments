Abstract    :
                Proposal   Number:  III-9361901    PI:  Steven Davis    Institution:  Physical
              Sciences, Inc.    Title:  Novel Kits for Teaching Science    This project will
              develop and test in the classroom four kits using inexpensive  ($25) diode
              lasers in the 630 - 670 nm spectral range.  The four kits  including the lasers
              which are to developed and tested are:  1)  Laser Threshold and Beam Divergence
               2)  Measurement of Diode Laser Wavelength  3)  Applications of Laser Induced
              Fluorescence  4)  Biological Applications of Lasers.    A fifth experiment
              would also be done which would be Atmospheric  Monitoring but only after the
              above four were completed.
