Abstract    :
              9361318  McNeill  A high power density (greater than  1,000 W/cc)
              microwave-driven plasma   source has been developed, and it can  potentially be
              an efficient vacuum  ultra  violet (VUV) light source. This  assessment is
              based upon previous   spectroscopic measurements and  power balance analysis of
              steam  plasmas  created at atmospheric  pressure with only 6 kW of power. We 
              propose to  a new UV light source with  high power below 200 nm. This class of 
              light  source can be potentially applied  to photolithography and surface 
              treatment  of polymers.
