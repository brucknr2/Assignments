Abstract    :
              9361718  Waters  Understanding the behavior on n- and  p-type doped cubic  boron
              nitride  (cBN) thin films is important to  ability to  make electronic devices 
              to take advantage of the thermal as   well as electronic properties of  cBN. n-
              and p-type doped  cN will be  grown using atomic layer epitaxy  (ALE) in a 
              molecular beam epitaxy  (MBE) vacuum chamber. Previously we   have been able to
              achieve BN films  which are highly cubic in  nature  through the use of an
              atomic  nitrogen source developed  at  Ionwerks and an electron beam 
              evaporator for the boron.  A dopant  study using mass spectroscopy of  recoiled
              ions (MSRI)  technique  developed at Ionwerks and secondary  ion mass 
              spectroscopy (SIMS) to  understand the various levels of  doping  will be
              performed on the  doped cBN samples grown. The various   concentration levels
              of the  corresponding dopants (Be and Mg   for p-type; Si and S for n-type) 
              will be analyzed so that  we have a  sufficient level to obtain a p-n 
              function.  ***
