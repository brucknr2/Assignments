Abstract    :
              9361776  Adams    This project will develop a new architectural approach for 
              insuring synchronization and determinacy that will make clock  synchronous
              fault tolerant systems modular and capable of  utilizing industry standard
              busses and off-the-shelf cards.  These architectural innovations will utilize
              the organizations  experience in designing, integrating, testing and fielding
              both  synchronous and non-synchronous fault tolerant systems.    Clock
              synchronous fault-tolerant systems are more efficient and  easier to program
              than their loosely synchronized counterparts.  An architectural approach and
              implementation that alleviates the  characteristic inflexibility of this type
              system will be highly  marketable in the current fault tolerant computing
              market.  ***
