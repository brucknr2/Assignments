Abstract    :
              9361271  Sachs  The goal of this project is to improve the prediction and 
              optimization of the performance of polymer gels in  applications in the
              agricultural, pharmaceutical, and  chemical production and purification
              industries.  These  improvements will be brought about by increased 
              understanding of transport, flow, and swelling in polymer  gels through: (1)
              elucidation of the physical phenomena  fundamental to their behavior; (2)
              quantification of these  phenomena in a mathematical model; and (3) development
              of an  experimentally verified software tool implementing these  models. 
              Design and optimization of gel-based technologies  could be significantly
              accelerated by this software.  In  Phase I, numerical computations based on a
              prototype model  will predict gel swelling and stresses, charge density, 
              solute concentrations, and solute and solvent fluxes.  The  model will be
              validated by comparing its predictions with an  experiment on release of blue
              dextrans.  ***
