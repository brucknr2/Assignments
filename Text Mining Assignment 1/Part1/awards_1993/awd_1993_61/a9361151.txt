Abstract    :
              9361151  CABRERA    This proposal requests Phase I funding to demonstrate the 
              feasibility  of developing a low-cost acoustic Doppler current  profiler (ADCP)
              suitable for shallow water applications, up to 50-m  depth. In addition to
              lower instrument cost, the new system will  provide a number of significant
              advantages over existing ADCPs such  as: ability to measure closer to the
              surface, more rugged  transducers, lower power consumption, smaller size, and a
              much  simpler operation and deployment. In Phase I we will investigate  the use
              of state-of-art electronics and application specific  hardware to minimize
              cost, size and power consumption.  New  transducer design and transmit/receive
              schemes will be evaluated  for reducing  sidelobe interference thus permitting
              velocity  measurements closer to the surface than what is common with 
              commercially available systems.  New materials will be evaluated  for the
              construction of transducers and pressure vessel to improve  the ruggedness of
              the instrument in areas of high biological  activity.  The system will be
              designed such that it can function  autonomously with internal batteries and
              data recorder, or as a  module that can be easily integrated into a larger
              instrumentation  package.
