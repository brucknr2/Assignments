Abstract    :
              9361743  McGrew       Several 3-dimensional visual display technologies exist,
              but  there is currently no satisfactory 3D hardcopy technology     available. 
              There is a clear need for archival 3D hardcopy    printers in a wide range of
              fields including medicine,        engineering, architecture and modeling.  This
              Phase I effort     is  directed at proving the feasibility of a desktop printer
                 which  can record a 3D hologram pixel-by-pixel at a speed     comparable  to
              high-resolution laser printing.
