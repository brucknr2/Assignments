Abstract    :
              9361597  Li    Important technologic obstacles must be removed before
              semiconductor devices monolithically integrated with oxide ferroelectrics can
              become a practical reality.  The innovations of the proposed program are:  1)
              advancing thin-film deposition technology to achieve fully epitaxial growth of
              ferroelectric films on silicon substrated, by using the highly successful
              pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique; 2) replacing the Pt bottom electrode
              with La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (LSCO) - an epitaxial conductive oxide material;   3)
              achieving a full monolithic integration of high-density
              ferroelectric/conductive oxide capacitors with Si integrated circuits.  The
              main thrust of Phase I will be to demonstrate the feasibility of epitaxial
              growth of a ferroelectric thin film (BaTiP3 or PbZrx Til-x), on top of a
              conductive oxide film (LSCO), on top of  an epitaxial YSZ buffered silicon
              substrate.  The resulting heterostructures will be used to fabricate a simple
              ferroelectric switched capacitor.  This device will be fully characterized and
              will become the basic building block for applications of ferroelectric thin
              films to the microelectronics industry.
