Abstract    :
              9361716  Jasinski  Single crystal silicon wafers are  essential for integrated
              circuit  (IC)  manufacturing. Our research  proposes to fabricate these wafers 
              directly in sheet form  in contrast  to cylindrical boules currently  utilized.
              The proposed technique  will reduce  complexity and cost of  the crystal growth
              hardware. Wafer  slicing from the boule is   eliminated along with the
              associated  kerf loss. And, fabrication in sheet  form alters the  basic
              thermal  transport of the crystal growth so  that scale-up to larger sizes can
              be   more straightforwardly accomplished.    Our research objective is to
              obtain  a final wafer product which is equal  or  superior to current wafers.
              The  Phase I research will demonstrate  that single crystal  silicon can be 
              fabricated in sheet form. Phase 11  will demonstrate scale-up to larger   sheet
              widths through the  construction of laboratory prototype  hardware and
              production  of high  quality single crystal product.    There currently is no
              domestic  vendor of silicon wafers to supply  the domestic  IC fabrication 
              industries. This puts the US IC  industry at severe jeopardy vis-a-  vis 
              export control from foreign  suppliers. SEMATECH has recognized  this risk and
              has  recently included  bulk silicon growth within their  scope of activities.
              This research   would promote the return of silicon  wafer manufacturing to the
              domestic  United States  marketplace.  ***
