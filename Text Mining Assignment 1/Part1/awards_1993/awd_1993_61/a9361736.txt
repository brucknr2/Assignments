Abstract    :
              This research deals with in intelligent vision perception system  modeled after
              a human cognitive system (retina); specifically, a  multilayer parallel focal
              plane array image processing system that  combines this company's highly
              advanced optical interconnects and  waveguide hologram techniques with a
              multilayer serial-parallel  structure; a RETinally INspired Algotecture
              (RETINA).  A 3-layer  RETINA structure and algorithms are being carefully
              studied and  implemented.  The first layer performs edge enhancement, the 
              second, reduced and/or eliminates noise, and the third implements  line
              construction algorithms to enhance results.  Sobol, median and  3-pixel line
              segments are being used for each corresponding layer.   Phase I of this program
              will produce (1) a useful algotecture, (2)  a determination of how it will work
              with noisy, nouniformly-lit  images, (3) an understanding of component
              tolerance, (4) the  critical waveguide hologram illuminator, and (5) a
              first-order  system design.  An edge lit waveguide hologram which is the 
              critical physical component will also be constructed, perfected,  and tested
