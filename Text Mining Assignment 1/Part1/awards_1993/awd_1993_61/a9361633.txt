Abstract    :
              9361633  Steffan  Bacteriophage particles will be developed using phage display 
              technology that specifically bind heavy metals (mercury and  chromium). Random
              phage libraries will be generated by cloning  degenerate nucleotides into genes
              encoding coat proteins of the  bacteriophage M13.  The resulting phage will
              have one of as many as  1013 random peptides exposed on their surface in up to
              2700 copies.   The resulting phage particles will be screened to select those
              that  specifically bind heavy metals.  Selected phage particles will be  used
              to remove metals from a variety of wastewaters including those  generated by
              industrial processes, nuclear facilities, soil  washing, and improper storage
              or disposal of wastes.  %%%  It is expected that using phage binding to
              pre-treat mixed organic  (organics + metals) wastes to remove metals will allow
              for the  successful biotreatment of many of the nation's heretofore 
              untreatable waste sites.  The successful demonstration of this  technology will
              provide a precedent for the future developments to  remediate even more
              difficult wastes such as mixed low-level  radioactive wastes (organics +
              radionuclides).  Completion of this  research will allow the development of a
              commercially-viable  biological treatment system for hazardous wastes
              containing  mixtures of organic contaminants and heavy metals.  ***
