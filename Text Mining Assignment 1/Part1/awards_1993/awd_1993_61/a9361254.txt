Abstract    :
                9361254  Armstrong  The object of the proposed effort is to show the
              feasibility of providing RF energy  control using a semiconductor switch.  It
              is postulated that such a switch can be made by  fabricating an array of high
              speed diodes on a semiconductor substrate which is placed  so as to control the
              flow of RF energy.  The proposed switch would be usable at a  frequency of 140
              GHz, switch at under 15 ns and handle peak and average powers of 100  W and 30
              W respectively.    The results of a successful program will enhance many times
              the sensitivity and  resolution of pulsed resonance instruments.  ***
