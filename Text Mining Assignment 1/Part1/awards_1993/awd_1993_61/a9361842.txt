Abstract    :
                    9361842  Ashford  This research will develop electronic diagnostics and
              novel high-  velocity electroflocking for advanced material fabrication.  Low- 
              velocity electroflocking is a common textile technology used in the 
              manufacture of pile fabrics, such as nylon velour, where  electrostatics are
              used to position large numbers of short fibers  (flock) on and partially into
              surfaces.  This research will alter  the conventional flock electrification and
              trans port conditions to  enable the attainment of high packing fractions,
              highly oriented  flock that is strictly vertical and bulk processing of fiber
              and  whiskers made of carbon, ceramic or metal.  These alterations are 
              required if the electroflocking process is to be useful for the  production of
              engineered novel oriented non-woven fiber composite  materials.  A model of the
              electroflocking process will be  developed and its predictions compared with
              experimental results  gained from flocking experiments in a proposed basic test
               configuration setup.  ***
