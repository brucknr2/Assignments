Abstract    :
              9361727  Kang  The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a 
              process for producing ceramic cell adhesion microcarriers with  controllable
              surface area, porosity, particle size, density, and  weight.  This is achieved
              by a combination of sol-gel and aerosol  techniques.  A controllable
              monodispersion of spherical seed  particles is first produced to form the basis
              of the  microcarriers.  These seed particles are then fused into larger 
              spherical agglomerates with the high surface area required for  cell adhesion. 
              Finally, a coating is added for biocompatibility  if required.  In Phase I,
              process feasibility will be  demonstrated by producing silica-based
              microcarriers and testing  them for surface area, porosity, and
              biocompatibility.  In Phase  II, optimization studies to control properties to
              produce  particles optimized for particular mammalian cell applications  will
              be conducted.  ***
