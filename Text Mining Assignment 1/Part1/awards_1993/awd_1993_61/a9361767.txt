Abstract    :
              9361767  Dwyer      This proposal deals with the development of unique
              "hyphenated" technology which will interface Gel Permeation Chromatography
              (GPC,SEC) or other forms of High Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC with
              Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).  This unique technology, along
              with accompanying software, will greatly benefit polymer chemists in their
              analysis and interpretation of  polymer composition and structure, a
              prerequisite for optimizing and controlling the polymerization reaction itself,
              with the goal of producing the best possible properties form the chemical
              stern.  ***
