Abstract    :
              9361545  Meador  Waveguides are used to transmit light through optical
              processors.   Combining the resolution potential of deep-UV photolithography
              and  the extreme sensitivity/high contrast of chemically amplified  positive
              acting (CAMP) resists offers a potentially simple method  for fabricating
              highly resolved, polymeric waveguides structures.   CAMP resists can be mated
              with other cladding materials with lower  refractive indices to provide the
              necessary gradient.  The  objectives of this program (Phases I and II) are to
              optimize CAMP  resists for waveguide applications, to directly fabricate
              structure  using deep-UV exposure, and to characterize the structure's 
              performance.    CAMP resists (thin film) are noted for outstanding sensitivity,
               contrast, and resolution; but thick film performance is not well  documented. 
              For the Phase I effort, we will synthesize two acid-  sensitive polymers
              {poly(p-t-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene) and poly(p- 
              t-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene-sulfone)} and two photoacid generators 
              (2,6-dinitrobenzyl tosylate and triphenylsulfonium triflate).  The  polymers
              and photoacid generators will be chemically characterized;  and formulated
              resists will be tested for thick film application  performance, deep-UV
              sensitivity, contrast, resolution, near  infrared absorption, and refractive
              index.  Resist(s) will be  micromachined into waveguides and at least one
              structure  characterized (optical loss, SEM, refractive index).    The resist
              materials and waveguide fabrication procedures developed  in Phase I will be
              further improved in Phase II and preferred light  guiding structures
              characterized.  ***
