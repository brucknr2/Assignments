Abstract    :
              9361755  Manasson  Physical Optics Corporation (POC)  proposes to develop a
              novel high-  power, low-loss, hollow-fiber   waveguide for the delivery of C02
              laser  energy. The waveguide's cladding will  be made of materials  with
              refractive  index n << 1 in the CO2-laser (10.6  micron) wavelength band. A
              unique  feature of the  proposed approach is  that the optical properties of
              the  cladding material can be easily varied  because of the  nature of the
              materials  employed. Thus, by slightly changing  material composition, the
              operating   wavelength of such fibers can be  "tuned," making this a generic 
              technology with broad applicability to  the  transmission of IR energy from any
               source. According to POC's preliminary  ca1culations, the proposed  design
              will  result in a fiber having transmission  losses that are orders of
              magnitude  lower, at 10.6  microns, than the lowest  losses reported for other
              fibers. It is at  this wavelength that we propose to first   demonstrate this
              technology.  ***
