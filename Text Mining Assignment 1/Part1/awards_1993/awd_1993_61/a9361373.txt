Abstract    :
              9361373  Hazelton  Plasma processing has moved to the  forefront of integrated
              circuit (IC)  fabrication technology.  Contaminants  continue to plague the
              industry being  responsible for more than 50% of the  yield losses.  These
              particles will also  act to limit the feature density on the IC  wafers. 
              Advances in cleanroom technology  have resulted in the plasma processor  being
              the main source  of  microcontaminants. Particles in the  discharge have been
              observed to  congregate in electrostatic  traps near  the wafer. The
              precipitation of particles  from these traps is a major source of 
              contamination.  We propose to actively clean the  particle traps. The energy of
              an electron  beam incident on  the particles can be  tuned to either increase
              or decrease the  particles' charge state. This disrupts the   electrostatic
              trap confinement allowing  the particles to be removed.
