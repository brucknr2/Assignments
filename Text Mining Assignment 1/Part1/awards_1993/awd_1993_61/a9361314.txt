Abstract    :
              9361314  Snyder  The principal investigator proposes an experimental program to 
              measure the effect on a laser diode's frequency of optical feedback  from a
              short cavity made from high-performance cylindrical  microlens collimators. 
              The microlens assembly, which circularizes  and collimates the diode output
              radiation to a diffraction limited  beam, will also provide highly efficient
              optical feedback into the  laser cavity.  From the results of these experiments
              we will design  a simple, low cost, compact, and robust tunable diode laser
              system  that utilizes collimating microlenses to form a short external  cavity
              for both longitudinal mode control and frequency tuning.  ***
