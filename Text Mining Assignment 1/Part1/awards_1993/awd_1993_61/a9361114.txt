Abstract    :
              9361114  AGRAWAL    We are proposing to develop a multi-point laser velocimeter
              to  obtain velocities at a number of points, simultaneously and non- 
              intrusively.  Our specific interest is to apply this  instrumentation to
              transport and exchange in surface and bottom  boundary layers However, the
              technique will be applicable to a wide  range of flows where simultaneous
              velocity measurements are  desirable. At the heart of the innovation is a
              completely non-  intrusive optical geometry which forms several sample volumes
              in  the flow, and corresponding receiving optics to distinguish their  images. 
              Such a device is needed to observe structures in natural  flows and to deal
              with issues such as flow stationarity.  This  simultaneous view of the velocity
              field will remove uncertainty in  the interpretation of velocity profile
              information; e.g. the  velocity shear and shear stress, turbulent
              characteristic scales  and roughness lengths.  The concept also concept also
              removes the  need for mechanical scanning devices or profilers, both of which 
              yield non-simultaneous measurements.  The use of this instrument  for
              characterizing the concentration and transport rate of  sediments in the bottom
              boundary layer is described.  The concept  is also beneficial to laboratory
              scientists using flumes, towing  tanks, and wind tunnels, in that multi-point
              measurements provide  additional information on flow structure and improve
              productivity.
