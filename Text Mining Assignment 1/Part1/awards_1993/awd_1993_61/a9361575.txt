Abstract    :
              9361575  Rivera       This project is to research and develop a knowledge-based,
               metalanguage-based object abstractor for the automatic  transformation of Ada
              programs.  This Object Abstractor (XOA)  will recognize relationships in
              existing, non-object-oriented  (OO) Ada, COBOL and C program, and will
              transform these programs  into a higher-level object-oriented Ada 9X, C++, or
              COBOL 95  architecture with reusable components.         The automatic
              abstraction and transformation of existing  sources, which for COBOL are valued
              at $2.3 trillion, may be the  only opportunity to modernize and rescue these
              sources from  obsolescence.  This system will be applicable to other languages 
              at little extra cost.  ***
