Abstract    :
              9361967  Brandes   The unique properties of semiconducting diamond may be
              exploited to create novel, compact, low-noise photon and particle detectors. 
              Photomultiplier tubes are the detector of choice when light levels are low or
              when the proper signal must be extracted from a cluttered background. 
              Continuous dynodes, known as channel electron multipliers, are widely used as
              particle detectors.  Innovative changes in these devices would greatly enhance
              their utility, sensitivity, stability and lifetime.  ATM proposes such a change
              - utilize the unusual properties of diamond to create a high gain, low-noise,
              compact, stable, and sturdy electron multiplier (dynode) chain.  Recent
              advances in chemical vapor deposition of negative electron affinity (NEA)
              diamond have made this feasible.  In the Phase I program we propose to optimize
              the growth of NEA diamond and to fully investigate the multiplicative and
              emissive properties of the material.  Phase II will extend the Phase I program
              to include fabrication and testing of a prototype photon and particle
              detectors.   A successful demonstration of the secondary electron emission
              properties of negative electron affinity diamond will make possible advance
              diamond-based photon and particle detectors.  The commercial applications for
              high gain, low noise, compact detectors or sensors are many, particularly in
              medicine (PET or SPECT detectors), pollution monitoring laser radar and
              absorption or emission spectroscopy.  ***   v       s  t
