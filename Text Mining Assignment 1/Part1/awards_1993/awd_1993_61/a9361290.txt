Abstract    :
              9361290  Mills    For most students, assessment means a single score or grade. 
              Such  one-dimensional assessments fail to convey information about the 
              student's creativity, originality, ability to do independent work,  problem
              solving skills, or ability to work cooperatively.  As  curriculum reform occurs
              across the country to meet the National  Council of Teachers of Mathematics
              (NCTM) standards, innovative and  alternative methods of assessment of student
              learning and progress   must also follow.  Student work itself should serve as
              the context  for rubrics for evaluation. In this SBIR Phase I project, Key 
              Curriculum Press will research and create such alternative  assessment
              materials for four technology-rich curricula to support  teachers who wish to
              align their assessment practices with  mathematics curriculum reform. 
              Specifically, the research will  involving linkages with national assessment
              reform efforts; surveys  of teachers using traditional and alternative
              assessment  techniques; interviews of teachers to develop case studies of 
              teachers who change assessment methods; development and refinement  of
              prototype assessment tasks; and pilot studies and evaluation of  these
              prototypes.      This project will make a contribution to the generation of 
              practical assessment materials--practical both in the sense that  they will be
              implementable and that they are derived from classroom  practices--that are
              complementary to the development of technology-  rich curricula and thus go
              beyond the traditional methods.  ***
