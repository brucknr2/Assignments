Abstract    :
              9361077  Achaerkar  There are many applications for a  tunable coherent 390 nm
              to  3.5 um  source but there are no tunable laser  sources and very few 
              discrete laser  lines in this region. By using a titanium  sapphire  laser and
              frequency doubling  there is limited tunability but this   approach suffers for
              poor conversion  efficiency, large size and  weight.  In this Phase I study,
              Schwartz Electro-  Optics, Inc. (SEO)  proposes a  Cr:LiSAF laser operating at
              0.78-1.0 um  as a pump laser  for an Optical  Parametric Oscillator (OPO) and a
               Second Harmonic  Generator (SHG) for  the generation of 0.39-3.5 um tunable 
              source.  SEO manufactures a high  power flashlamp pumped Q-switched  Cr:LiSAF 
              laser (model Laser 1-2-3).  For this study this laser will be used  at  no cost
              to the program. The concept of  pumping Cr:LiSAF with a  laser diode to  reduce
              laser size and weight and  improve reliability  will be evaluated. In  Phase II
              program, the diode pumped,  all  solid state, broadly tunable laser  source
              will be used in the  desiqn,  fabrication, and test of a DIAL system  for
              remote sensing.  ***          .
