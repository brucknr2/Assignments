Abstract    :
              9361278  Murphy  Power system stabilizers are used to prevent oscillations
              induced  by generators on the utility network.  This is typically done by 
              installing instruments at the terminals of the generator.  As lines  become
              more heavily loaded, and the generators are run at higher  outputs, system
              stability becomes a more critical issue.  Without  proper stabilization,
              generator outputs must be reduced and/or line  loadings reduced to keep the
              system form becoming unstable,  resulting in a power outage.  The use of remote
              input stabilizers  based on phasor measurement techniques will result in
              increased  reliability, and enormous dollar savings is terms of deferred plant 
              and transmission construction.  ***
