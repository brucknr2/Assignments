Abstract    :
              9361838  Pang  Title:  Design and Implementation of Network Protocols for
              Desktop  Multimedia Communications  This project is funded under the National
              Science Foundation's  (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program,
              which is  designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly 
              the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the
              SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising  proposals and determine if
              the firm can do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal research
              project.  Phase III is  the conversion of the NSF-funded research into 
              commercial applications and technological innovation supported by  follow-on
              private venture capital or other non-federal financing.   This PhaseI project
              addresses the networking requirements of  desktop multimedia systems.  Research
              is being done in four areas:   1) network resource management to support
              multimedia traffic,  2) multimedia transport protocols including multicast
              support,  3) multimedia conference control, and 4) multimedia  internetworking
              with existing room teleconference equipment.  ***
