Abstract    :
              9361882  Dockterman    Falling test scores, a struggling economy, an ethnically 
              diverse population, and changes in the global marketplace  have brought the
              American educational system under  increasing scrutiny and attack. The need for
              new skills in  the Information Age has prompted reform efforts in all areas  of
              the curriculum, but with a special focus on science. In  concert with
              curricular change, reformers have also targeted  assessment. They have
              recognized that what is evaluated  often drives what is taught. Thus, there is
              a very pressing  need in K-12 education today for practical programs and 
              materials to help all schools plan and implement alternative  assessment
              approaches. In response to this need, Tom Snyder  Productions, working with the
              Coalition of Essential  Schools, proposes to prototype and evaluate a 
              technology-based package designed to engage teachers and  administrators in
              informed discussion and practical ongoing  action in the area of alternative
              assessment in science  instruction. The centerpiece of this package will be a 
              CD-ROM based simulation, Dealing with Assessment: Science  Education, that
              simultaneously introduces the issues and  provides a foundation of skills for
              independent action by  teachers and administrators.  ***
