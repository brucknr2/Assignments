Abstract    :
              9361694  Mateja    This project is using the pioneering of the past 25 years and
              combining the use of computers and  a new piezoelectric material to conceive an
              array of 14,000 nodes that can produce the dimple  for tactile sensation.  The
              project also answers the need for Descriptive Video Service (DVS)  to persons
              with visual impairment.    The project is called VISual to TActile CONversion
              (Vistacon)  Vistacon can be an affordable  and personal system for the blind. 
              It is based on the concept of coupling a video cassette  recorder (VCR) to a
              digital converter/controller that drives a state-of-the-art film platen in a 
              variety of direct tactual modalities.    In phase I the project staff intend to
              determine the feasibility of three technical issues:         1.   the technical
              merit and efficacy of using piezoelectric film to produce the standard         
                Braille dots as graphic elements.         2.   response times and tactile
              readability of the graphic elements through a test            system.        
              3.   real-time access of graphics, pictures, symbols, and text in an
              electronically            erasable medium    ***
