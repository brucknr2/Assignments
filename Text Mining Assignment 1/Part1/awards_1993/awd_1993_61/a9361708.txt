Abstract    :
              9361708  Cosman    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in
              the general area of separations  chemistry and in the subfields of extraction
              and crystallization. The objective of the research is  to demonstrate the
              separation and purification of small quantities of complex natural products  by
              supercritical fluid (SCF)/cosolvent extraction and crystallization. The process
              steps include  critical fluid comminution of raw materials, selective SCF
              extraction of product and closely  related compounds, purification by
              programmed SCF elution of extracts by HPLC, and SCF  crystallization of the
              active natural product(s). Techniques to be investigated in the Phase I 
              studies include retrograde crystallization, which relies on the inversion of
              temperature  dependence of solubility as pressure is increased; "homologous"
              antisolvent recrystallization, in  which the proportion of SCF in the
              SCF/cosolvent mixture is increased in order to decrease  extractant polarity
              and cause precipitation, and; "heterologous" antisolvent crystallization, in 
              which a third component is added to affect extractant polarity and cause
              precipitation.  Prototypical natural products to be studied are Taxol and
              Cephalomannine.  %%%  Successful results of the Phase I studies will find
              application in the crystallization/purification  of natural product
              therapeutics such as Taxol which are finding increased use in the health care 
              industry. Commercialization will be facilitated by increasing their
              availability while reducing  manufacturing costs.  ***
