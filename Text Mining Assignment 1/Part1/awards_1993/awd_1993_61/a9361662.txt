Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: 9361662  PI Last Name: Lagnese    Computer architecture courses
              may use a lab-based approach to  emphasize the design process.  However, such
              an approach is  severely limited by the time available for the course.  DASYS 
              proposes to provide a tool that will abstract away tedious details  of the
              design process and allow the students to spend more time on  the more creative
              aspects of design.  DASYS' architectural  partitioning/high level synthesis
              tool allows the user to begin the  design process with an abstract behavioral
              description of the  architecture to be designed, and produces an RTL
              description of the  design which can be passed on to lower level tools for
              realization.   During its design process, DASYS' tools allow for designer
              control  through constraint specification and direct interaction.  DASYS 
              proposes to determine how this tool could best be used in an 
              electrical/computer engineering curriculum by exploring how the  tool can aid
              in one or more courses that are currently part of the  computer engineering
              curriculum at Carnegie Mellon University.   Such a tool currently is not
              available, either commercially or  pedagogically.  ***y
