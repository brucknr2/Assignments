Abstract    :
              9361034  Buchholtz  Improving the wear-endurance-lifetimes of sputtered MoS2 on 
              Titanium (Ti) alloys represents an enabling technology for these  alloys. 
              Colorado Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) proposes  to pretreat Ti-6A1-4V
              surfaces by elevated-temperature-ion-  implantation and
              reactive-ion-beam-sputter-deposition to produce  ceramic surface layers, which
              will significantly (i.e., 2 orders  of magnitude) improve the
              wear-endurance-lifetimes of sputtered  MoS2.  Ceramic layers that exhibit a
              range of electronic (band  gap) properties will be formed on Ti-6A1-4V
              substrate surfaces.  Pretreated substrate surfaces will be characterized by
              X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy to establish the binding  energies/chemical
              states of elements important in the bonding  process.  Scratch adhesion tests
              on the MoS2/pretreated  substrates will be performed to establish the three
              best  pretreatments.  Wear-endurance-lifetimes tests will then be  performed,
              in an argon atmosphere, on specimens exhibiting the  greatest adhesion. 
              Correlations of ceramic electronic properties  with MoS2 tribological
              performance will be made.  Preparation of  pretreated substrates and mechanism
              gears for commercial coating  vendors to apply their specific tribo-coatings is
              a viable  product.  Increased use of Ti gearing in mechanisms and 
              transmissions will result in reduced weight of space and  terrestrial vehicles
              and increased fuel efficiency.  ***
