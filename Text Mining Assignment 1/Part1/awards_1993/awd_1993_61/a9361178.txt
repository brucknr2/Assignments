Abstract    :
              9361178  Zaidi   Laser application for noncontact temperature measurement of a
              semiconductor wafer is proposed.  The technique can be applied for either
              chemical vapor deposition or rapid thermal processing systems.  The method is
              based on thermal expansion of a semiconductor wafer, and uses speckle patterns
              generated from the back side (rough surface) of the wafer.  Speckle patterns
              are generated by coherent illumination by two symmetrically incident laser
              beams.  Speckle patterns are recorded at various temperatures and subtracted
              from an initial frame stored at a known temperature.  Speckle decorrelation
              takes place as number of fringes approaches typical speckle size. 
              Signal-to-noise ratio of the speckle fringes is improved by incorporating
              single-step phase shift in our data acquisition and processing system. 
              Temperature measurements up to 400-deg are demonstrated with a single reference
              stored frame.  Fast Fourier Transform of speckle fringe patterns is applied for
              calculation of speckle fringe period of extract temperature information.  A
              detailed investigation of these techniques is proposed for speckle temperature
              measurements up to 1000-deg.   1. Potential applications in RTP and CVD
              systems.  2. Improvement in material synthesis using better temperature during
              fabrication.  ***   v       s  t
