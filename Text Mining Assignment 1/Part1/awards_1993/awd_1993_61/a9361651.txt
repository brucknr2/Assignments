              III-9361651  Bend Research Inc.  Walter C. Babcock    Abstract    The aim of
              this project is the formation of new hollow fiber membranes made of plasma
              polymers.  The method derives from earlier work on the preparation of
              flat-sheet plasma membranes which were both flexible and highly selective. 
              Testing of the hollow fiber membranes will include the specific application of
              separating oxygen from air.    Membrane technologies offer the prospect of
              effective, low energy separations in processes that readily scale up.  Advances
              in the synthesis of new membranes will help American industry be more cost
              effective and better able to address environmental concerns.     PYI     BK!
