Abstract    :
              Federal and state regulations require that employers train millions of US
              workers about the risks of hazardous chemicals to which they are exposed on the
              job, including how to access information on multi-page Material Safety Data
              Sheets (MSDSs).  Many employers are also required to communicate information
              about hazardous chemicals to the public for environmental release monitoring
              and to prepare for emergency response to community endangering accidental
              releases of hazardous chemicals and at hazardous waste sites.  Previous
              research has identified limitations in communicating the information in MSDS. 
              As they increasingly contain information useful to multiple users, MSDSs have
              become longer, and more difficult to use.  Little effort has been made to
              tailor the structure and format of MSDSs to the multiple needs of different
              users.  We propose to investigate a method of structuring and communicating the
              information contained on MSDSs according to various users' needs, capabilities,
              and skills.  We will build on adult literacy research previously carried out by
              proposed subcontractor, Educational Testing Service, Inc.  From the varying
              practices and proficiencies of MSDS users we will also identify criteria for
              prototyping a computer-adaptive multimedia system for presenting chemical risk
              and risk related information to multiple users of varying needs and abilities.
