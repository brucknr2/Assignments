Abstract    :
              9361595  Groat    Polymeric materials are used extensively in a multitude of
              applications due to a unique balance of cost and structural properties. 
              However, where thermal applications are concerned, the utilization of polymeric
              materials is extremely limited due to poor thermal transfer.  Structural
              polymers typically exhibit thermal conductives orders magnitude lower than most
              metals and ceramics.  particulate fillers have been utilized with only marginal
              improvements due the isolated arrangement of the filler particles.    ART
              proposed a research program which will create research quantities of shaped AlN
              particles, and test the relative improvement in thermal conductivity of a
              polymeric matrix. This information will be incorporated into the existing
              models of filled matrices which will be modified to include particle shape.
