Abstract    :
              9361288  Holland    This project will develop the Software Implemented Fault- 
              Tolerance (SIFT) Layer for the purpose of enhancing the  reliability and
              availability of applications running on massively  parallel computers.  The
              SIFT layer will handle the requisite  detection, reconfiguration, routing, and
              recovery techniques  necessary for the protection against hardware faults,
              transparent  to user application.    This project could lead to a
              cost-effective solution to  unreliability in massively parallel computers for
              business and  scientific applications.  ***
