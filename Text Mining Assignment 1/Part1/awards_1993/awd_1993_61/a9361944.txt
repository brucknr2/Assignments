Abstract    :
              Neural computation requires very high computing bandwidths for  real-world
              time-varying classification problems.  This project is  developing a low cost
              multiprocessor signal processing system to  provide these high bandwidths.  The
              multi-processor will be  transparently integrated with an existing
              neural-network software  package that provides a simulation environment for
              dynamic neural  networks.  The combination of fast hardware and easy to use 
              software will make fast neural computing affordable in a PC  environment.
