Abstract    :
              9361009  Drolet  This project will develop a cross platform application
              framework  to simplify numerical simulation problems while taking advantage  of
              emerging technologies such as parallel and distributed  processing. 
              Application Frameworks (AFs) are extensive programs  which are specialized into
              particular applications by adding code  specific to each application.  AFs
              facilitate the development of  scientific and engineering numerical simulation
              applications.    The project will result in a scientific and engineering tool
              to  facilitate the development of numerical simulations and models.  Models
              derived from this framework will be easily portable across  computing
              platforms.  ***
