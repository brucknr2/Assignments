Abstract    :
              9361664  Swedlund  The goal of this project is to develop a tissue culture
              system  for the neem tree, Azadirachta indica, to provide a source of  pure
              secondary metabolites.  The best known product from this  plant is the
              insecticide azadirachtin.  This compound is  effective, even though it has a
              very low toxicity.  Production of  azadirachtin in tissue culture would provide
              a constant supply  year round, while eliminating the large quantities of
              solvents  that are required when this compound is obtained by extraction  from
              seed material.  The phase I research objectives include: (1)  the determination
              of the effects of various hormones on the  initiation and maintenance of
              cultures, and the production of  azadirachtin by cells of the neem tree; (2)
              the use of the best  cultures in further experiments designed to increase the
              levels  of azadirachtin; and (3) to determine the location within neem  seeds
              where azadirachtin is produced in order to develop better  cell types for
              tissue culture.  ***
