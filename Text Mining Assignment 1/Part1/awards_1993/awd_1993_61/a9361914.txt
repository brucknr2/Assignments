Abstract    :
              9361914  Vickery  Estimates of design windspeeds in the nonhurricane-prone 
              region of the United States are derived from historical  records of windspeeds
              obtained from surface level  anemometers.  These surface-level windspeed
              measurements are  subject to errors produced by terrain effects, nearby 
              structures and vegetation, changes in the height of the  anemometer over time,
              and observation errors.  These  measurements are made only at fixed anemometer
              stations and  there is no first principle method to estimate winds at  other
              locations.    This research project investigates an innovative method for 
              determining windspeeds and their spatial variations for  extensive pressure
              systems (EPS) using a first principle  direct analysis approach.  The proposed
              methodology makes  use of the recently available, and inexpensive, data set of 
              historical records of surface pressures for the contiguous  United States. 
              Using this data, the pressure field can be  reconstructed on an hour-by-hour
              basis.  From the  reconstructed pressure field a continuous record of 
              windspeed and direction at gradient height can be generated  at any one
              location or multiple locations in the United  States.    The approach
              eliminates the problems which plague surface-  level measurements and provides
              a means to estimate area-  wide risk associated with the passing of intense,
              large-  scale, low pressure systems.    This is an SBIR Phase I project.  ***
