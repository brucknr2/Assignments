Abstract    :
                    9361070  Sachs  This research is to develop a new viscoplastic
              constitutive model  which utilizes internal variables in order to model the
              Bauschinger  effect.  It will account for rate and temperature dependence,
              large  strain kinematics and a suitable corotational stress rate.  The  model
              will be implemented using an existing Lagrangian finite  element computer code
              and will be verified by comparing simulation  predictions with experimental
              results for several common  experimental and manufacturing configurations.  ***
