Abstract    :
              9361889  Groger  The objective of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of
               developing highly selective thin film sensors to determine the  identity and
              metabolic rate of micro-organisms in subsurface  organic waste bioremediation
              processes.  Questions to be  addressed include identification of organic
              molecules for  fabrication of thin films containing nutrients as functional 
              groups which are used differentially by a range of microbial  species,
              development of a miniaturized surface plasmon  spectrometer to monitor the
              differential metabolism of micro-  organisms, calibration under laboratory
              conditions and design of  an engineering model of a microbial detector to
              monitor the  bioremediation process.    This is a Phase I award based on a
              proposal submitted in response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation
              Research (SBIR) Program  Solicitation.  Results are expected to identify design
               characteristics of a field operable method of identifying micro-  organisms
              and determining rates of metabolism of selected species  in the presence of
              toxic organic chemicals with potential  applications in the chemical, food and
              pharmaceutical processing  industries.
