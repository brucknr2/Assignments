Abstract    :
              9361481  Townsend       A new generation of robots with high-bandwidth,
              backdrivable  transmissions driven by high-performance brushless DC motors 
              presents the opportunity for improving the flow of force data back  to the
              controller without additional force sensors.  This research  will develop an
              algorithm for determining contact geometry, to be  used as feedback to the
              controller or teleoperator.  The algorithm  will complement existing
              force-sensor and tactile-sensor techniques  which offer improved accuracy, but
              otherwise limit the  responsiveness and stability of the system.  The proposed
              research  will compile a set of prototype force-control tasks, determine the 
              special kinematic equations necessary to calculate contact force  vectors,
              develop a mathematical and graphical representation of the  contact geometries,
              determine the best implementation algorithm for  the required speed, and
              outline specifications for experimental  development in Phase II.  The result
              of this research will be  faster, more dexterous robots which relay greater
              information about  the process than existing robot systems.  US companies, such
              as  Adept and Barrett Technology, have helped lead the international  community
              in backdrivable robotic hardware development.  By  improving the control
              algorithms to capitalize on these hardware  improvements, the US should retain
              its competitive lead in this  area of robotics.
