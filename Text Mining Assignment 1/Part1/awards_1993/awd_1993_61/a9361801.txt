Abstract    :
              9361801  Jackson       Current position tracking technology is inappropriate for
               typical commercial applications, such as scientific visualization  and
              computer-aided design.  Position trackers available today also  tend to be too
              expensive for widespread use and do not provide or  facilitate haptic display. 
              Today's haptic display technology also  has serious problems.  The most
              commonly experienced haptic  sensations are those produced when two rigid
              objects contact each  other, and current haptic display technology cannot model
              these  situations convincingly.  We propose to implement an innovative  haptic
              display which can effectively model contact with rigid  objects.  We will
              combine it with an extremely accurate three-  dimensional position tracker to
              produce a commercially viable  product for three-dimensional computer
              workspaces.
