Abstract    :
              9361987  Caughey  We propose the design, construction  and evaluation of a 3-12
              um  narrowband light source  based on an  optical parametric oscillator/optical
               parametric amplifier pair (OPO/OPA),   consisting of ZnGeP, crystals that are 
              pumped by a tunable Kl P OPO. The  tunable KTP  OPO, which is itself  pumped by
              a Nd:YAG laser, provides a  novel method not only for  pumping the  ZnGeP2 OPO,
              but for providing an  additional option for tuning and for   characterizing it.
              Means for narrowing  the limewidth of the ZnGeP2 OPO will  be evaluated.  Since
              femtosecond and  picosecond Nd:YAG lasers are  available. the proposed system
              can   lead to an ultrafast tunable IR source.  The proposed Phase I program is 
              expected to  provide the technical base  for the manufacture of a long sought
              3-  12 um tunable laser source.  ***
