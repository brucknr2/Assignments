Abstract    :
              9361646  Lei  The proposed will develop an injection laser capable of emitting
              coherent radiation in the spectral range from the blue to the ultraviolet.  A
              wide bandgap semiconductor will be provided with an asymmetric barrier that
              will permit injection of minority carriers while blocking the extraction of
              majority carriers, thus establishing the necessary population inversion.  To
              make this light emitter into an injection laser, the device can be provided
              with either a Fabry-perot cavity or a superlattice that forms a distributed
              feedback grating.  A simple structure will be made to demonstrate that
              efficient minority carrier injection can be obtained with resultant emission of
              short wavelengths.  Then the final structure will be designed and the limits of
              performance will be calculated; obtainable wavelength range, expected
              efficiency, power handling capability, and far-field pattern.  ***
