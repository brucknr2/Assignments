Abstract    :
              9361483  Kalumuck    Research in this project aims toward the development of
              thermal  swing adsorption technology for the concentration and removal of 
              gaseous species by polymeric adsorbents.  An existing mass  transfer numerical
              model will be extended to include heat  transfer effects and then applied to
              understand the influence of  the physical and operating parameters on system
              performance.  Experiments are planned with a polymer/gas pair to demonstrate 
              feasibility and validate the model predictions.         Efficient and
              economical means are needed to remove gases like  volatile organic
              compounds(VOCs) for American industries to meet  environmental concerns and
              remain competitive.  This method could  overcome the sensivity to humidity and
              complications from  regeneration of carbon adsorption beds.  ***
