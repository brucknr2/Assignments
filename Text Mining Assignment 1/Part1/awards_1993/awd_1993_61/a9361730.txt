Abstract    :
                  9361730  Aye  POC proposes an entirely new approach to tomography in which
              recording and  reconstruction of the 3-D object is done in 2-D slices
              automatically, without significant  computer assistance and with very high
              spatial resolution.  This new process is based on  reduced coherence
              interferometry and will be called Spatial Coherence Effect  Tomography (SCET). 
              SCET overcomes the limitations of both classical holographic and  tomographic
              approaches.  Previous attempts at 3-D tomographic imaging usually involved  2-D
              projection images and the heavy use of computers for data processing and
              display,  thus reducing spatial resolution.  Although holographic imaging can
              provide high  resolution, it lacks an intrinsic tomographic interpretation. 
              The proposed method is  based on holographic recording using radiation with
              very short temporal coherence  length which can overcome major drawbacks in
              techniques using such sources, e.g., x-ray  lasers, while still preserving the
              advantages of both tomography and holography.  Moreover, the method is simple
              and efficient because it can provide a continuum of high  (spatial) resolution
              images of object slices in a single recording.  This new system will  produce
              low-cost, high-resolution tomographic imaging for biological structural
              analysis  as well as other non-destructive-evaluation (NDE) applications.  ***
