Abstract    :
              9361943  Zhang  This Phase I SBIR award has the objective to determine the 
              feasibility of using a new laser deposition technology  (Pulsed Laser
              Deposition) to coat metallic knee prosthesis  materials with the ceramic ZrO2. 
              The hypothesis is that the  ZrO2 coating will improve the reliability of knee
              prosthesis  through a unique combination of strength, toughness, and  wear
              resistance, and that a biocompatibility will be  established.  ***
