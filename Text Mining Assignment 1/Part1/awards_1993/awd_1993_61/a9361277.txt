Abstract    :
                    Proposal Number:  III-9361277    PI:   Mary Appelhof    Institution: 
              Flowerfield Enterprises    Title:  Videomicroscopy of Live Earthworms       
              This project will adapt videomicroscopy and use of fiber  optics similiar to
              those used for endoscopy in medicine  to study eartrhworms. The equipment will
              allow direct  observation of earthworm digestive tracts, pumping pairs  of
              hearts, the inside of their burrows and the emergence  of the worms from their
              cocoons.  This will be possible  because young worms are quite translucent.  A
              videotape  record of what the students see using the new equipment  will also
              be possible.  Teacher and student evaluations  of existing videotape will be
              used to determine the  optimum array of equipment to be built.
