Abstract    :
              9361074  McAllister  The objective of the project is to show the feasibility of
              a  totally new antigen-antibody sensing technology, acoustic  emission
              chemistry, that requires no initial sample or sensor  preparation.  Many
              biochemical dynamic systems are acoustically  active with some of the energy
              released as an acoustic wave.  It  is hypothesized that such chemical reactions
              propagate an  acoustic emission spectra during the antigen-antibody reaction. 
              The proposed investigation would attempt to prove the hypothesis  by
              determining a frequency spectrum, amplitude and time duration  of the acoustic
              emission signals from antigen-antibody reaction  as a function of reactive
              antigen-antibody concentration for the  given experimental condition.  ***
