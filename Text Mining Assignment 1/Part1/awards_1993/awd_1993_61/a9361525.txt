Abstract    :
              9361525  Bado    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in
              the general area of surface  chemistry and in the subfields of Secondary Ion
              Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and Multiphoton  Resonance Ionization (MPRI). The
              objective of the research is to fabricate and test a high-  sensitivity
              nanoprobe with the capability of directly determining the lateral location of
              atoms and  molecules on nonconducting surfaces with high spatial resolution
              (100nm) and very high  sensitivity in the atomole range. The nanoprobe will
              combine sub-picosecond laser techniques  in MPRI with focused ion beams from
              TOF-SIMS in surface imaging applications. During Phase  I, the development of a
              post-ionization ultrashort pulse laser source will be emphasized. Laser  source
              parameters will be optimized to boost nanoprobe sensitivity. A two to three
              order of  magnitude improvement in sensitivity over systems with identical
              spatial resolution is anticipated.  %%%  There is a clear market in surface
              science and biology for imaging tools with sub-micron  resolution and high
              chemical sensitivity.  The proposed nanoprobe complements existing 
              capabilities in optical and electron microscopy, provides the ability to
              identify chemical species  with high spatial resolution, and promises to
              enhance our ability to image biological surfaces.  ***
