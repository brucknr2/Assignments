Abstract    :
              9361080  Kumar      Liquid crystal display (LCD) technology is currently the
              most popular platform of flat panel displays (FPD), but it suffers from complex
              manufacturing and high cost problems. Great difficulties have been experienced
              in producing demonstration prototype field emission displays (FED) which have
              been promoted as the leap-frog FPD technology.  This is mainly attributed to
              the manfacturability and scalability problems associated with the traditional
              micro-tip type of cold cathode used as the source of electrons in all current
              FEDs.  The recent invention of Amorphic Diamond (AD) field emitter cold cathode
              is probably the first revolutionary discovery affecting FPD technology sine the
              original micro-tips were developed almost twenty years ago.  The thin film AD
              cathodes have a very low effective work function (on the order of 0.2eV), have
              high density of emission sites, have high thermal conductivity, are chemically
              inert, can be deposited at room temperature, and are FDP  material and process
              compatible.  We are proposing to concentrate on the understanding of the field
              emission phenomenon from these films and to carry out a systematic study for
              optimization of these materials.  A better understanding of these mechanisms
              will help not only in the development of higher quality AD emitters, but may
              also lead us to new (non-carbon based) and even better field emitters.  ***
