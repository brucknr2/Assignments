Abstract    :
              9361543  Kelkar    Funded under and SBIR Phase 1 grant, research is to be
              conducted on  mixing in agitated vessels stirred by a rotating impeller. While
              such  mixers have been in use for a very long time, predicting mixing 
              performance in a new design is still highly empirical and uncertain. This 
              research is to develop a computer model of the process based on a  novel method
              for allowing the method to couple the rotating flow near  the impeller with the
              more irregular non-rotating flow elsewhere in the  mixer. Software is to be
              developed for dealing with this situation as a  tool for optimization and
              scale-up.    Beyond permitting mixing equipment manufacturers to create
              optimized  designs with such a predictive tool, the code will have other
              possible  applications in all fluid systems where only parts of the flow are 
              rotating.  ***
