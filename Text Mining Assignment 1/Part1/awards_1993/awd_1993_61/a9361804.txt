Abstract    :
              9361804  DeFlaun  Concern over the use of chemicals that potentially contribute
              to  ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect has led to a ban on 
              chlorofluorcarbons (CFCs) and a phase out on the use of  methyl bromide.  CFC
              replacement compounds, the hydrohalocarbons,  also have either ozone depletion
              potential or are possible  greenhouse gases.  Preliminary studies have shown
              that there may be  a number of naturally-occurring microorganisms capable of
              degrading  these compounds.  %%%  A bioremediation/biorestoration system for
              hydrohalocarbons and  methyl bromide based on the degradative abilities of
              these  organisms will be developed.  Successful development of this  process
              will result in a cost-effective means to biologically  degrade ozone-depleting
              chemicals, thereby eliminating the health  risk to the general public.  ***
