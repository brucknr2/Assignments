Abstract    :
              9361378  MacInnes  While GaAs and other III-V compound semiconductors have many
              desirable properties their practical use has been limited by the poor
              electrical quality of its surfaces and interfaces with other materials.  For
              example, in contrast to the electronic perfection of the Si-SiO2 interface, the
              formation of oxides on GaAs results in a high density of surface states that
              effectively pin the surface Fermi level at the midgap, causing a high surface
              recombination velocity.  Because of this, devices such as MISFETs have yet to
              be fully realized on GaAs, and the performance of devices sensitive to surface
              recombination is hindered.  Since the incorporation of any passivation stage
              within the growth of the device structure is a particularly desirable, MOCVD
              offers an attractive candidate for in-situ passivating layer growth.  It is the
              goal of this work to develop Gallia's proprietary GaS technology for MOCVD
              passivation of III-V devices as an integral part of device manufacture.  In
              addition, new passivating materials will be developed for III-V compound
              semiconductors other than GaAs.  ***
