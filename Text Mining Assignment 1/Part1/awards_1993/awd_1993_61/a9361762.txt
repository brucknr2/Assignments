Abstract    :
              9361762  Maruska      Spire proposes to directly synthesize thiogallate phosphor
              films and use ion implantation to provide red, green, and blue color centers
              for display applications.  Due to their smaller size, weight, and power
              requirements, flat panel displays (FPDs) based on AC thin film
              electroluminescence (TFEL) are a highly desirable alternative to cathode ray
              tubes, but at present, no phosphor host has been identified which can support
              all three colors.    To produce full-color displays at relatively low cost,
              Spire proposes a greatly simplified manufacturing process mad possible by
              producing thin film ternary sulfide electroluminescent materials by direct
              evaporation of CaS, ZnS, MgS, and Ga2S3 to form the ternary thiogallates
              MGa2S4.  Recently, TFEL FPDs based upon multiple stacks of ZnS (filtered red
              and green) and a new calcium thiogallate (blue) phosphor have been
              demonstrated.  We propose to eliminate the need for multiple phosphor layers,
              hence multiple deposition steps, by obtaining red, green and blue
              electroluminescence form multiple rare-earth activators ion-implanted into a
              signal thiogallate host.  Spire has already shown that multi-color TFEL
              displays can be fabricated in ZnS hosts using this process.  Because it
              eliminates the need for multiple phosphor deposition and patterning steps, the
              proposed fabrication process will lead to a significant reduction in FPD
              Manufacturing costs.    ***
