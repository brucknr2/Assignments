Abstract    :
              9361437  Hannon  AstroPower proposes the development of monlithically integrated
              bicolor edge emitter-detector pairs for wavelength-division multiplexing in
              fiber optic communications.  This device utilizes laterally graded A1xGa1-xAs
              layers formed by liquid phase epitaxial deposition onto a continuously moving
              substrate.  Multiple light emitting diodes and detectors can be colinearly
              integrated in the same device to emit/detect light of different wavelengths. 
              The A1GaAs system allows for composition control so that an array of devices
              sensitive to different wavelengths can be fabricated on the laterally graded
              structure.  This program will explore the limits of the moving substrate
              technique in forming laterally graded layers.  The optoelectronic integrated
              circuit will be designed for optimum emission and detection capabilities. 
              AstroPower has extensive experience with the design, fabrication, and
              characterization of LEDs and detectors as well as with liquid phase epitaxy --
              all of which will have a strong impact on the success of this program.  ***
