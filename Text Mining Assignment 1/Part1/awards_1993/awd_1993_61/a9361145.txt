Abstract    :
              9361145  Worthington    In response to customer demand for accurate temperature
              measurement of Si and GaAs, Thermionics propose; to use a new temperature
              sensor to measure the temperature Si and GaAs wafers above 800 C and as high as
              1100 C.  The technique uses a system called (DRS) Diffuse Reflectance
              Spectroscopy. The principal behind DRS is that it measures the changing band
              gap energy as a function of temperature.  The sensor uses a light source
              located out of the growth camber that is modulated so that it can be detected
              in the presence of other light sources, such as the heater source.   
              Preliminary measurements of Ga using DRS show smooth variation of the optical
              wavelengths associated with the absorption threshold between 4K and 1000K.  The
              laws of Physics and thermodynamics suggest that band gap measurements can be
              made above these temperatures.  In Phase I, Thermionics expects to develop
              techniques and improvements to  the DRS sensor technology to measure
              temperature above 1100 C.
