Abstract    :
              9361665  Ting  This project deals with reduction of boat drag through a 
              modification of the pressure field around the vessel by venting  areas of high
              pressure to areas of low pressure via orifices  through the side of the hull
              connected by ducting. The research  consist of a combination of model testing
              on a single hull and  theoretical analysis. General approaches are developed to
              predict  the opportunities for reduction of drag, and consequently the 
              necessary propulsion power, for a variety of displacement vessels  ranging from
              small boats to large ships.  ***
