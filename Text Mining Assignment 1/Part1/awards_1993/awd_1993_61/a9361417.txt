Abstract    :
              9361417  Dean  This project is to determine the feasibility of developing a 
              dynamic, socket-fitting system for lower-limb prosthesis.  An  important
              objective of the investigation is to develop a  quantitative method for
              establishing socket geometry to provide a  precise fit to the amputee's stump. 
              A precise socket-fitting  system for making the initial socket and to
              compensate for stump  volume change over time would reduce tissue trauma, pain
              and the  expenses of numerous fittings.  An ancillary result would be the 
              development of a scientific data-base for the profession to serve  as
              guidelines for fitting the prosthesis to the patient.  ***
