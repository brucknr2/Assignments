Abstract    :
              9361888 Nemire  Medical advances, new legislation and changing social attitudes
              have encouraged more disabled individuals to continue their education. 
              However, disabled students have limited access to typical science laboratories.
               One promising and innovative way to provide access is through virtual
              environment technology which can provide a unique tool for the disabled by
              offering opportunities for manipulative exploration and mobility without
              requiring physical access, dexterity and strength.  This project is developing
              a virtual learning environment (VLE) to provide greater educational
              opportunities to disabled persons.  In Phase I. the staff will perform human
              factors analyses to facilitate VLE design, construct a prototype of their VLE,
              including a module for physics instruction, and evaluate its utility.  VLEs
              will benefit disabled students by providing them grater control over their
              environment and more educational opportunities.  The potential applications of
              VLEs for education are vast and will provide the next generation of interactive
              learning systems.  Development of VLEs fits America's agenda of developing
              technology for economic growth and facilitating education and training of
              disabled and non disabled individuals.  The Interface Technologies research and
              development team has extensive experience in conducting experimental and human
              factors research, designing and developing virtual environments, and developing
              adaptive technology for persons with disabilities.
