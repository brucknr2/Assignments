Abstract    :
              9361403  Manasson          A novel integrated optics device which combines a
              waveguide  Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a Gunn  oscillator is proposed. 
              One potential application of the device is as an optical clock  generator with
              selfexcited oscillations of light propagating through  the device. In the Phase
              I project, a theoretical  understanding of the  underlying phenomena will be
              developed, and a proof-of-concept  experiment will  demonstrate the device's
              feasibility. Various  semiconductor materials will be studied for their
              potential   applications in the device. Up to 100 GHz clock-frequency is 
              anticipated after the full-scale development  of the device in Phase  II.  ***
