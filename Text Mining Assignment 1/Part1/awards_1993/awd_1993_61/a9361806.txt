Abstract    :
              9361806  LEONARD    All of the marine invertebrates of current interest in
              bio-active  products research are sessile benthic suspension feeders.  Past 
              research on similar species leads one to surmise that fluid  motion is likely
              to have profound influence over virtually all  aspects of their life histories.
               However, the  flow biology of  many invertebrates of biochemical interest is
              completely unknown.       This research is to develop a system that is capable
              of detecting  sensitivity and dependency on flow in benthic marine 
              invertebrates currently in aquacultural development. This  technology will be
              used in commercial aquaculture development as  a tool for bringing new benthic
              invertebrate species into  culture, and for defining flow conditions of optimal
              biomass and  natural product yield in aquaculture.
