               Title:  Interactive Physics CD-ROM      This project is to develop a
              multimedia Interactive Physics CD-ROM  designed for self-paced, non-evaluative
              use by high school students.  This  CDI disk will be designed to be used in
              conjunction with the videodiscs  Physics: Cinema Classics (PCC) which are
              already developed and which  include a barcode directory for all the 2,000
              video/images on the discs as well  as a teacher's guide for them.
