Abstract    :
              9361506  Meyer  We aim to demonsate the feasibility  of using hydrogen azide,
              HN3, for  ultra low  temperature, plasma-free  nitridation. Our goal is to
              achieve  breakthroughs both in  reducing the  time/temperature budget and in 
              improving performance of nitride  films for  ULSI microelectronics and  flat
              panel display manufacturing.  Non-plasma based thermal  and  photodissociation
              of hydrogen azide  for low temperature silicon nitride  CVD is the  subject of
              the Phase I  research.    The Phase I emphasis is placed on  characterization
              of major process  chemistries  resulting from thermal  and photodissociation of
              hydrogen  azide, including analysis of  the  effluent, and determining
              deposition  parameters which yield films with  good  physical and electrical 
              properties. CVD SiN films will be a  demonstration vehicle,  forming the  basis
              for applications evaluations  in Phase 11. This approach promises   ultra low
              temperature processing,  the absence of charged particle  induced device 
              damage, low pinhole  density, reduction of hydrogen  incorporation, low
              particulate   generation, wide area uniformity,  and controlled nitrogen
              radical  species that can be  tailored for  specific films. The variety of 
              available azide sources allows for  choice of  best point-of-use  chemistries
              that will enable  advanced ULSI and flat panel display   fabrication processes.
