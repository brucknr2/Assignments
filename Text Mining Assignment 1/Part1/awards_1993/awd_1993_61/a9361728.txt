Abstract    :
              9361728  Genders  This is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation 
              Research Solicitation.  In a previous effort, a process based on  the
              electrochemical hydrodimerization of formaldehyde at a graphite  cathode was
              developed.  A drop in oil prices, and a resultant drop  in ethylene prices, the
              feedstock for the major present process for  ethylene glycol, made the new
              process economically unattractive.   This effort is an extension of the earlier
              work designed to reduce  the capital and operating costs required. 
              Modifications include  operating in an undivided, narrow-gap cell with
              noncatalytic  electrodes thus eliminating the need for costly membranes and 
              catalysts; using solvent extraction for product isolation and  employing
              gas-diffusion electrodes.    Ethylene glycol is an important commodity
              chemical.  It is a  precurser to polyester, is the principal antifreeze
              compound in  use, and has other applications in chemical processing.
