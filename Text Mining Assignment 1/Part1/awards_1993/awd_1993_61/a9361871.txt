Abstract    :
              9361871  Van Hove  The principal investigator proposes to fabricate (A1GaInAsSb)
               quantum well laser structures for 2-5 um IR application.  This  material
              system has desired properties and will be compatible with  III-V device
              processing technology.  The laser diodes will be grown  by Molecular Beam
              Epitaxy method.  We shall use in-situ monitoring  techniques for tight material
              parameter control, and use dopants  which may lead to improved performance. 
              The work will be based on  our extensive experience in these materials. 
              Materials will be  thoroughly characterized and the growth condition optimized.
                Device modeling will lead to improved understanding and advanced  structures
              for enhanced performance.  ***
