Abstract    :
              9361843  Chun    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              is in the general area of  computational chemistry.The goal of the research is
              to develop an algorithm which recursively  finds an exact solution to Lagrange
              multipliers. Simple unconstrained molecular dynamics  simulations need to use
              small steps to track the high frequency dynamics that result from stiff 
              springs representing chemical bonds and angles. To increase the step size,
              constraints are often  introduced in the particle equations by including a term
              representing the constraint gradient  multiplied by a Lagrange multiplier.
              While rigorous, this method introduces new computational  overheads, which has
              led to the approximate and not entirely satisfactory SHAKE algorithm.   SHAKE
              works well with bonds and angles, but fails to generalize arbitrary
              constraints. In this  feasibility research, an algorithm, called EXACT which
              represents an exact constraint technique,  will be developed which will handle
              open and closed loops, is highly efficient, can generalize  arbitrary
              constraints and will be well-suited for parallel implementation.  %%% 
              Computationally efficient molecular dynamics algorithms are an enabling
              technology to deal with  practical problems such as rational drug design and
              design of advanced polymer composites. The  EXACT algorithm will be directly
              useful for real-world applications and, if successful, by the  end of Phase II
              will be incorporated into various commercial software systems for dissemination
               to the computational chemistry community.  ***
