Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- III-9361740  Wright    The PI proposes to use a continuous plasma
              pyrolysis process to synthesis metallofullerenes starting with either a liquid
              or gas phase hydrocarbon and a metallic precursor (e.g. benzene or toluene plus
              a an organometallic compound).  In Phase I a plasma torch (2KW), operating up
              to 100 Torr (argon) and seeded with the appropriate starting materials, will be
              used.  The use of a continuous plasma process should results in increased
              residence times and in better controllability of the process.  In phase I, the
              plasma technique will be demonstrated and the resulting metallofullerenes will
              be characterized.
