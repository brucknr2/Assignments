Abstract    :
              9361742  Levesque  This project is to develop runtime analysis tools that can 
              examine the data distribution of a program, and establish a  communication
              pattern for transferring the data between  processors.  Additionally, it will
              be important to supply the  user with a facility to arrive at an optimal
              decomposition of  data on irregular grids across the parallel system.    The
              success of this project will assure the availability of  powerful
              parallelization tools for converting large FORTRAN  applications to massively
              parallel processing more viable for  users from many application areas.  ***
