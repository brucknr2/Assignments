Abstract    :
              9361690 Jacobsmeyer  This project is funded under the National Science
              Foundation's (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is
              designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small
              high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the SBIR
              program serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the
              firm can do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal research project.
               Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial
              applications and technological innovation supported by follow-on private
              venture capital or other non-federal financing.  The focus of this Phase I
              project is to investigate a new adaptive technique for code division multiple
              access (CDMA) channels that will increase digital cellular capacity.  The
              technique automatically and dynamically adjusts each user's data rate to the
              instantaneous fading and interference conditions of the CDMA channel.  The
              research objectives are to model the channel, simulate the technique, and
              demonstrate performance improvements in throughput and blocking probability. 
              Throughput improvements of a factor of 5 and reductions in blocking probability
              of a factor of 4 appear possible.
