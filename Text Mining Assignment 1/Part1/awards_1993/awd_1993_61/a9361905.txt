Abstract    :
              9361905  Leung    This research will develop the architecture for an
              interoperable  recursive database server (IRDS).  The server will communicate
              with  clients based on DAL, an industrial standard on data access  language
              supporting heterogeneous database environments.  Recursive  views defined with
              powerful logic rules are supported.  Queries on  recursive views will be
              automatically translated into equivalent  database operations on the base
              relations.  The translation is  based on pre-complied information obtained from
              the analysis of the  structure of the recursion during view definition.  A
              toolkit and  a prototype will be developed as a feasibility study.  There are 
              not many databases in existence today which contain the type of  features
              described in this proposal.  Therefore such features will  embelish the
              performance of database systems.
