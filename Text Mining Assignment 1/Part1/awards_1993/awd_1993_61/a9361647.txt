Abstract    :
              9361647  Schroeder    Emerging fifth-generation educational environments will 
              increase the flow of information between the student and the  instructional
              delivery system to levels never before  possible. One group of fifth-generation
              systems,  conceptually descended from graphics-based simulators, uses  virtual
              reality (VR) technology to capture motor responses  and alter a simulated world
              accordingly. A proposed second  group, conceptually descended from embedded
              training systems  and called a literal reality (LR) system, is the focus of 
              the proposed work. In LR applications, students will move  freely about in a
              real-world educational environment,  receiving instructions and feedback in
              part from tools to be  developed in this effort. Three supporting devices will
              be  investigated to determine their potential value as tools for  LR and VR
              systems. Specifically, three-dimensional  anthropometry systems and an existing
              cordless audio  computer interface will be investigated, adapted, and tested 
              for their value in LR and VR systems. Also, a  computer-controlled laser
              pointer will be studied for its  value as a tool for LR systems. A prototype LR
              educational  environment will be created and demonstrated.  ***
