Abstract    :
              9361031  Woodworth  In this research project, a digital open loop servo-valve 
              actuator is developed. The major advantages of such valve  actuator over
              conventional systems include lower cost,  higher performance, greater
              reliability and repeatability,  higher electrical and hydraulic efficiency,
              regenerative  energy capture and insensitivity to fluid contamination 
              clogging. Since the valves are operated as either fully open  or fully closed,
              the control system allows the valves to  literally break up the fluid flow into
              small increments. The  high speed of the valve makes small movement control and
               precision possible. Potential applications of the system  include robotics,
              automated manufacturing, aircraft flight  controls and power generation. ***
