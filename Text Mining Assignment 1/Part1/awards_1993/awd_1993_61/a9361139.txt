Abstract    :
              9361139  Shaffer    In the near future, our children will make choices that will
               significantly change all life on earth.  Thus, it is imperative  that they
              obtain a coherent overview of how the biosphere operates  and of how they are
              participants in that operation.  A fascination  for children of all ages and
              attitudes, Closed-Ecological-Systems  (CES)--developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion
              Laboratory for Life-  Support Studies and further researched for the past two
              decades at  the University of Hawaii--are a gallon-sized simplified analogue of
               the biosphere that will autonomously recycle its elements and  support life
              for decades.  While CES, which are considered  authentic "mini-planets," have
              obvious instructional value  concerning global ecologic topics, currently
              marketed CES novelties  are static and of limited usefulness.  This Small
              Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to investigate 
              the feasibility of developing a specialized interactive CES-  photobioreactor
              containing shrimp-algae and even fish-plant  ecosystems and incorporating
              accurate but inexpensive  instrumentation; accompanied by defined media;
              experimental  protocols; and short instructional text modules to serve as a 
              supplemental educational aid applicable to grades K-12.   The project has the
              potential to contribute a hands-on approach to  explore a variety of major
              ecologic principles from the simple to  the sophisticated and to offer the
              educator a vehicle for which to  introduce related environmental subjects.  ***
