Abstract    :
              9361386 Stormon  This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's
              (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to
              provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small high
              technology firm, to participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the SBIR program
              serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can
              do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase
              III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications
              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or
              other non-federal financing.  This Phase I project studies the feasibility of
              using a programm able content-addressable memory as an efficient hardware
              implementation of data compression/decompression.  The project concentrates on
              the loss less compression techniques essential for network applications.***
