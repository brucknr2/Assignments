Abstract    :
              9361232  Taylor  Existing commercial modeling and simulation software packages
              do  not adequately predict the behavior of complex computer-  controlled
              systems being developed and fielded today.  These  "hybrid" systems involve
              discontinuous phenomena such as  mechanical parts engaging and disengaging
              (e.g., spacecraft  docking), control units switching, and software components 
              reconfiguring.  Unfortunately, these effects are handled  inaccurately and
              sometimes even missed completely.  Recent  research in nonlinear systems has
              revealed that there are many  circumstances where this deficiency presents a
              major barrier to  showing that a system will perform as required, or conversely
               that a newly designed system may have safety-critical defects.   For example,
              a hybrid system may be prone to oscillation or to  chaotic behavior (seemingly
              random motion) and the simulator will  not be able to predict these problems in
              time to avoid costly  accidents or redesign.  We propose in Phase I to develop
              both a rigorous modeling  language for representing such phenomena, and
              integration  algorithms that will simulate discontinuous nonlinear hybrid 
              systems with complete accuracy.  The language will be developed  according to
              modern standards, to facilitate correct modeling  practices.  The integration
              algorithms will rigorously catch and  hand all discontinuous events.  A
              commercial package will be  produced in Phases II and III.  ***
