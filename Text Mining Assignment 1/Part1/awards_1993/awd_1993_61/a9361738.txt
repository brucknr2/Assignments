Abstract    :
              9361738  Entine   A high speed, high sensitivity avalanche photodiode (ADP)
              array is proposed to meet the stringent requirements of detectors for high
              energy physics experiments such as the central tracker vertex detector and
              calorimeters which are being designed for existing and proposed particle
              physics detectors.  These detectors will have unprecedented performance
              characteristics to be used as readouts for the very low light levels produced
              in scintillating plastic fibers which result from charged particle interactions
              at very high recycle rates.  The approach taken will be to modify existing APD
              designs to yield a device with lower dark current, increased sensitivity at
              short wavelengths, and faster cycle times when operated in the single photon
              Geiger mode.  Consideration was given to adaptability of the APD to active
              quenching circuitry.  Constructing high gain devices that fulfill detector
              needs for proportional mode operation such as those required for high dynamic
              range calorimetry measurements will also be investigated.  The data gathered
              during this work will be used to produce an APD array with the required
              combination of characteristics to be used in high speed, low light level
              applications envisioned at modern detectors such as the D0 at Fermilab and L3
              at CERN.   Millions of detectors will be needed for modern particle physics
              facilities.  This alone is a large market.  Also, these improved APD's will
              find numerous other uses in industrial applications, such as medical imaging,
              and research applications.  ***   v       s  t
