Abstract    :
              9361940  Pfefferle    Catalytically stabilized thermal combustion (CST
              combustion) offers significant advantages for high efficiency , ultra-low
              emissions combustion applications in gas turbine engines, burners,
              incinerators, and even internal combustion reciprocating engines.  With CST
              combustion, nitrogen oxides emissions can be effectively eliminated without
              aftertreatment by enabling combustion at a temperature below the nitrogen
              oxides formation level.  Combustion efficiency is maintained at a high level
              and carbon monoxide/unburned hydrocarbon emissions are kept low.  Yet limits on
              the ability of the catalyst and its substrate to survive high temperatures
              (e.g. 1200C - 1600C) in reactive atmospheres have severely restricted practical
              applications.  Doped aluminum base oxides such as hexaaluminates and
              perovskites offer the promise of a thermally stable, Catalytically active
              monolithic catalyst material through the proper choice of dopant atoms. 
              However the nature of the dopant residence and the effect of the dopants on the
              morphology of the hexaaluminate macrostructure is uncertain.    We shall
              investigate the affects of doping and anchoring catalytically active atoms into
              aluminum based oxides for use in CST combustion.  In particular, we shall
              investigate the morphology, sintering resistance, dopant site residence, and
              catalytic activity as a function of dopant concentration and processing.  ***
