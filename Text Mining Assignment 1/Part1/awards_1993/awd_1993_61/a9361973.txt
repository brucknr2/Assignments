Abstract    :
              9361973 Kemp          Most electropolishing treatments for stainless steels
              employ multiple open mildly acidic vessels.  Concerns regarding fumes and
              carryover of more aggressive acids make commercial treatments for titanium
              unavailable.  An automated enclosed single tank electropolishing machine
              provides and environmentally friendly method for titanium.  Workpieces are
              placed in a dry vacuum tight chamber and necessary fluids are sucked in. 
              Electrolytes and rinse fluid storage canisters are sealed and rinse fluids are
              continuously deactivated.  All servicing is through removal and replacement of
              sealed tanks.          The work includes construction of a working model and
              the verification of procedures which include pulse current and ultrasonic
              capabilities.  Phase I will also include metallurgical characterization of
              electropolished titanium and zirconium samples.  Phase II includes prototype
              construction with complete automation and the characterizing of metallurgical
              effects on representative ferrous, nickel, and reactive alloys.  Immediate
              beneficiary will be the medical industry where titanium is now finished by
              manual polishing.  Longer term the new system can move many electroplate/polish
              operations into the clean computer controlled environment of the modern
              production facility.
