Abstract    :
              9361179  Beetz    The development of cold electron emitter technology has the
              potential for broadly impacting the rapidly growing area of electron
              spectroscopy.  Commercially available instrumentation such as Auger
              spectrometers typically employ thermionic electron sources which restrict their
              scope of use through filament heating effects and thermal cracking of gases on
              filaments.  These instruments are also not capable of performing time resolved
              phenomena on the sub second level.  The development of a robust cold emitter
              capable of high frequency pulsed operation would not only solve these problems
              but more importantly, it would enable revolutionary new development in the
              construction of extremely high speed, high sensitivity electron spectroscopic
              instrumentation employing Fas Fourier Transform (FFT) time of flight
              measurement techniques.  In Phase I, Advanced Technology Materials, Inc (ATM)
              will determine the feasibility of fabricating a cold cathode electron source
              using a novel diamond junction base emitter.  The cold cathode source will be
              evaluated and in Phase II be employed in the construction of a prototype FFT
              Auger spectrometer.  In Phase III commercial production of cold cathode
              electron beam guns is anticipated for use in a variety of electron spectroscopy
              and UHV instrumentation applications.  ***
