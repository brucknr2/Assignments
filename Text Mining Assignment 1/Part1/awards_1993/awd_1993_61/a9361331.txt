              National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              program, which is designed to provide an opportunity for small business,
              particularly the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research. 
              Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising proposals
              and determine if the firm can do high quality research.  Phase II is the
              principal research project.  Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded
              research into commercial applications and technological innovation supported by
              follow-on private venture capital or other non-federal financing.  This Phase I
              project investigates the use of microlaser arrays to produce multichannel
              optical heads for retrieving data off CD-ROM.  The project is evaluating the
              performance and functionality of CD-ROM drives using the multichannel read-out
              with (a) the present CD-ROM format, and (b) a new encoding and demodulation
              format optimized for multichannel read-out.
