Abstract    :
              9361907  Ng  Field tracking of smoke and obscurant clouds from forest  fires or
              volcanoes requires determination of the two-  dimensional cloud extent shown in
              visible images scanned  from various angles about the clouds.  At the present
              time,  two-dimensional cloud extent is determined by an operator  who manually
              locates points on the cloud perimeter -- a  procedure which has been found to
              be expensive, time  consuming and vulnerable to human misjudgment.    To
              address this problem, this project undertakes a study for  the development of
              computer vision algorithms based on human  preattentive visual processes for
              the automatic recognition  of smoke clouds.  The objectives of this research
              include a  study of human preattentive vision to determine important  visual
              cues, incorporation of these visual cues into  computer vision algorithms for
              detecting cloud regions,  development of a neural network pattern recognition
              system  utilizing these algorithms, and integration of the system  with a
              user-friendly graphical interface.    The innovative use of image analysis
              features based on human  preattentive visual processes for automated cloud
              detection  is significant.  Since features modeled on human visual 
              preattention are capable of functioning in a scene-  independent manner, a
              system for automatically recognizing  obscurant clouds that is superior to
              present methods will be  demonstrated.    This is an SBIR Phase I project.  ***
