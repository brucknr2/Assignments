Abstract    :
              This project is the design and fabrication of a high-performance  convolver
              integrated circuit that can be coupled to a digital  neural network classifier.
               The architecture has a predicted  single-chip performance of 50 billion
              multiply/accumulates per  second, which can be maintained with realistic chip
              I/O bandwidths.   The high performance is achieved at the architecture level by
               computing several convolution kernels simultaneously, and at the  circuit
              level by using compact multiplying DAO's and analog current  summing.  The
              prototype designed during this project will be  fabricated using commercial
              bulk CMOS technology.
