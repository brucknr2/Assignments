Abstract    :
              9361270 Jewell The principal investigator proposes to develop ruggedized optical
              array connectors for interconnection of electronic processing modules through
              parallel fiber ribbon optical backplanes.  Computer manufacturers consider
              optical backplanes an inevitable next step in interconnections and optical
              connector arrays to be the most needed component.  Arrays of vertical cavity
              surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are ideally suited for the transmitters and
              PRI will utilize its world leadership in this field to optimize VCSELs for
              optical backplanes.  In Phase I we will:  1) specify the performance
              requirements for the optical backplane components:  microlaser arrays, fibers,
              connectors, detectors; 2) survey the mechanical and micro optic "tools"
              available for optical connector arrays; 3) design VCSELs for multimode fiber
              backplanes 4) design connector arrays for the optical backplanes; and 5)
              develop the Phase II plan for demonstration and commercialization.  Assembly of
              the technical team for commercialization of optical backplane interconnects has
              begun at PRI and will continue throughout Phases I and II.  Optical backplanes
              are most immediately needed in the avionics industry, hence our program targets
              an initial high performance avionic computers.  The work will also directly
              impact the development of fiber optical networks for aircraft sensor
              communication and for local area networks. ***
