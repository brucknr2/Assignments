Abstract    :
              9361195  Halverson  A device called the Bucky Grid is widely used for enhancing
              X-ray  images.  The Grid allows primary X-ray radiation to pass through 
              unimpeded while stopping scattered radiation from reaching the X-  ray film and
              fogging the image.  The Bucky Grid is limited in its  use to diagnostic
              radiology applications for "spots" larger than  one millimeter, making it
              unsuitable for mammography procedures.    The proposed investigation would
              determine the feasibility of  using ion beam etching and photolithography to
              create high-  definition, high transmission grids with line widths less than 
              0.1 mm.  Successful results from this investigation would lead to  the
              development of a medical device that would reduce the level  of X-ray power
              required to produce clinically usable images and  offering the potential of use
              in mammagrapy procedures.  ***
