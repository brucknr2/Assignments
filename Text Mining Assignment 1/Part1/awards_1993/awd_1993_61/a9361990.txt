Abstract    :
              9361990  Weiman       Efficient sensory perception and processing are crucial to
               mobile robot navigation.  As sensor technology advances,  conventional
              processing methods become a bottleneck, crippling real  time operation. 
              Transitions Research Corporation has recently  develop a low-cost LIDAR system
              capable of generating 10,000  samples per second, challenging conventional
              sensor data processing  rates.  This research project will efficiently and
              robustly  compress sensory range-bearing data by applying the log-Hough 
              transform to recognize walls and characterize them parametrically.   Walls are
              the dominant navigation reference features in built  environments.  The
              log-Hough transform converts a long chain of  sensor hits on a wall to a single
              data point representing line  parameters.  This succinct data can be used for
              localization  against a priori maps without overloading communications channels
               to the navigator.  In Phase I, LIDAR data will be gathered and  analyzed with
              respect to range and bearing resolution; software  will implement the log-Hough
              transform for these data.  In Phase  II, the method will be implemented in a
              real time prototype  navigation system running on TRC's HelpMate mobile robot. 
              In Phase  III, the method will be incorporated into a commercial product for 
              mobile robots navigation and obstacle avoidance.
