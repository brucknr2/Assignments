Abstract    :
              9361110  Sherman    In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to investigate an
              innovative new class of materials which  should provide dramatically increased
              strength, modulus, and wear resistance while maintaining mechanical properties
              to high temperature.  The proposed concept utilizes ceramic foams, fabricated
              by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as high-strength interconnected
              three-dimensional continuos reinforcements for metal matrix composites
              consisting of interpenetrating, continuous metal and ceramic phases, taking
              full advantage of the desirable properties of each phase while eliminating the
              inherent drawbacks of each phase, such as low temperature brittleness in
              ceramics and high temperature creep and wear in metals.  The proposed
              investigation covers the modeling, fabrication, characterization, and testing
              of ceramic foam-reinforced aluminum-based metal matrices and provides the
              groundwork for further investigation and development.  The effect of material
              compositions, reinforcement structure and volume fraction, and processing (melt
              infiltration) conditions on the microstructure and flexure, tensile, and
              processing (melt infiltration) conditions on the microstructure and flexure,
              tensile, and impact properties of these unique composites will be investigated.
               Limited design information, such as physical properties, mechanical properties
              (strength and modulus), and thermal fatigue and thermal shock resistance, will
              be generated as well.
