Abstract    :
              9361398  Zang    Two-dimensional spatial light modulators (2DSLM) are key to
              every optical signal/computing architecture.  However, 2DSLMs have not been
              well developed for practical applications due to a lack of high quality
              nonlinear optical (NLO) material and inadequacies in the device concept. 
              Current 2DSLMs greatly limit the development of optical signal processing.   
              MetroLaser proposes to develop an innovative, two-dimensional optically
              addressed, thresholding, and erasable 2DSLM.  The proposed 2DSLM is based on a
              nonlinear Fabry-Perot interferometer modulator with cavity material made of
              bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a newly developed nonlinear optical (NLO) photochromic
              protein.  The proposed device utilized the large refractive index change of BR
              in the Fabry-Perot cavity to alter the device optical transmission.  This
              device is expected to have excellent spatial resolution, high optical
              sensitivity, easy erasability, simple, adjustable thresholds, random address
              capability, enormous pixel density and high contrast.  If this project
              succeeds, it will be a major breakthrough in the real-time, high speed optical
              implementation of pattern recognition, optical computing, neural network, and
              nonlinear imaging processing.  The Phase I effort will consist of analytical
              and experimental work aimed at evaluating spatial resolution, sensitivity,
              write/erase cycles, and fabrication procedures of the BR-SLM.  ***
