Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- III-9361773  Lyon    A new form of combustion is described which if
              successful, will be capable of burning natural gas and other fuels which do not
              contain chemically bound nitrogen without any formation of NOx.  The PI
              proposes to mitigate NOx formation and achieve much higher heat transfer rates
              especially in boiler applications, by carrying out combustion of natural gas
              using CuO as the oxidizer.   CH4  will be passed over and oxidized by a heated
              CuO/Alumina bed. The bed is reoxidized back to CuO by air in a separate step
              and therefore, no direct air/CH4 reactions take place and no NOx can be formed.
               Furthermore since the energy producing reactions take place on a solid surface
              rather than in the gas phase, the heat transfer rate is much greater and the
              combustor can be made much smaller than the usual boiler and fire box.     The
              proposal provides a real practical solution to the problem of NOx emission from
              combustion systems.
