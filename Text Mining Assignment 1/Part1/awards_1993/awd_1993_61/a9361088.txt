Abstract    :
              9361088  He    The development of a new type of composite color filter is
              proposed.  This color filter will be composed of a polymer (Methyl
              Methacrylate) reinforced with colored optical glass and will have the combined
              properties of a glass, solution, and gelatin filter.  Glass composition will be
              developed and techniques for preparing composite color filter will be
              established.  Basic properties of glass fibers or composite filter will be
              established.  Basic properties of glass fibers or composite filter will be
              evaluated in this work.  ***
