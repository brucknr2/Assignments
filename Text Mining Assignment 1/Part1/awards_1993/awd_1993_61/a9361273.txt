Abstract    :
              9361273  Kumar  In this proposal, a high speed field emission triode device is
              described which does not require high vacumm for operation. This is enabled by
              coating a micro-tip cathode with recently invented very low work function
              diamond time film, such that the electric field to extract electrons from the
              cathode is less than 5 volts per micrometer.  Hence a voltage of only 5 volts
              need be applied between the cathode and the grid to extract electrons making
              this device compatible with standard semiconductor electronics.  At the same
              time, low voltage electrons have mean free paths in air which are longer than
              the cathode-anode separation, thereby a non-vacuum operation of such a device
              may be possible.  In phase I, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of such
              a high speed device by designing, computer modeling and fabrication diode and
              triode type field emitter devices.  ***
