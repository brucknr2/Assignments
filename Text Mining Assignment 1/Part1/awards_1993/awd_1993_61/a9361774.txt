Abstract    :
              9361774  Grahn       Tactile sensors are a class of robotic sensors capable of 
              measuring contract interaction between a robotic gripper and a  grasped object.
               The use of tactile sensors will greatly enhance  the use of unmanned vehicles
              and robotics in both the military and  civilian sectors by making robots more
              able to deal with  uncertainty in the environment.  Currently, the use of
              tactile  sensors in real-time control applications is limited by the low 
              update rates available from current sensors. This research seeks to  overcome
              that restriction by creating a Computational Tactile  Sensor (CTS) that
              combines special-purpose VLSI circuitry with an  ultrasonic tactile sensor to
              achieve high data rates.  The  resulting CTS will lower bandwidth and wire
              requirements by  performing local self-scanning of the tactile array and 
              preprocessing of the tactile data.  The data rates achieved by the  CTS will be
              sufficient for applications that use tactile sensors in  real-time control
              applications.  The technology and algorithms  developed in this research effort
              will also be applicable, in  general, to all array-based tactile sensor
              technologies, yielding  the same reductions in bandwidth and wire count, and
              allowing  operation in real-time applications.
