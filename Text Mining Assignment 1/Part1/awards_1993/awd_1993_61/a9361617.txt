Abstract    :
              9361617  Dichter         The PIs will identify several areas in which
              pyrgeometer  design could be improved and will outline experiments to verify
              the  enhanced performance.  The goal of the proposed program is an  instrument
              that significantly exceeds the minimum requirement of  the BSRN network of 5%
              (or 10 W/m2) measurement error and is close  to the WMO-defined performance
              level for a secondary standard total  solar pyranometer (1% measurement error).
