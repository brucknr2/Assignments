Abstract    :
              9361731  Anderson    This Small Business Innovation Research Proposal (SBIR)
              Phase I proposal is in the general area  of electrochemical synthesis. The
              objective of the research is to replace hypochlorite with 
              ecologically-compatible hydrogen peroxide prepared on site. Presently the only
              available on-site  technology is the electrochemical production of caustic (pH
              14) peroxide. The high pH and high  costs associated with the use of sodium
              hydroxide limits the environmental applications of  peroxide prepare in this
              way. In this feasibility study, an on-site peroxide generator requiring  no
              reagents other than water and power will be developed based on an
              electrochemical technique  employing anion exchange membranes. The cathodic
              reduction of oxygen to peroxide in base  is highly efficient. The incorporation
              of anion exchange membranes in a fuel cell arrangement  will utilize this
              chemistry but will eliminate the necessity for free flowing caustic, producing 
              only neutral peroxide.  %%%  The availability of low cost, on-site generated
              neutral hydrogen peroxide would find immediate  applications in municipal water
              purification, bioremediation, and waste disposal and have an  favorable
              environmental impact in the various applications where environmentally
              hazardous  oxidizers are currently used.  ***
