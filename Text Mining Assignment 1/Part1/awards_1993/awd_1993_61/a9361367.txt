Abstract    :
              9361367 Oakes          An innovative technique for the polishing of
              polycrystalline diamond films is described which uses a high flux, high
              translational energy (5 to 10 volt) atomic oxygen beam at glancing incidence to
              etch surface roughness.  The method operates in a reactive etchant energy
              range, at high flux, that is not obtained by any other chemical or physical
              method.  As a result, the technique is capable of high polishing rates (0.2
              micrometers/min) at low substrate temperatures.  In addition, it is non
              intrusive and is intrinsically scalable for large area (1000 cm2) polishing. 
              In a collaborative effort with industry, efficient, high rate diamond etching
              with a significant degree of surface finishing has been demonstrated.  Existing
              polishing techniques suffer from one or more of the following deficiencies: 
              slow polishing rate, small polishing areas, high substrate temperatures during
              polishing, the need to aggressively handle the diamond film or substrate, and
              the potential for defect and impurity incorporation into the diamond film
              resulting from interaction with energetic ions.  The proposed technique is
              capable of overcoming all of these deficiencies.          Due to diamonds
              superlative properties the potential commercial applications of diamond films
              are extensive.  In particular, polished polycrystalline films have optical and
              tribological applications.  Application of diamond as a heat sink will also
              benefit from this technique.
