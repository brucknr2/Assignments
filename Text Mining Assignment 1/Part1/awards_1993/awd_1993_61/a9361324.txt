Abstract    :
              9361324  Kalkhoran  The principal investigator proposes to demonstrate visible 
              electroluminescent (EL) devices fabricated on a porous polysilicon  thin film
              on a glass substrate. In Phase II, a working matrix of  red, green, and blue EL
              devices for a full-color display panel will  be developed.    The principal
              investigator recently fabricated the first Si-based  light-emitting diodes
              configured as heterojunctions between an  electrochemically-processed p-type
              porous Si and an n-type  transparent semiconductor (indium-tin-oxide).  Quantum
              confinement  in Si nanostructures is the key to the luminescence of these 
              devices.  These LEDs emit yellow, orange, and red light:  The  fabrication of a
              porous Si-based blue LED is presently being  investigated at Spire with NSF
              funding.  Although most previous  work on porous silicon devices has employed
              bulk Si materials  rather than Si thin films, Spire has shown that bright
              visible  light can be obtained from porous structures formed on 
              polycrystalline silicon thin films deposited on quartz substrates.   The
              principal investigator now proposes to extend this development  to create a
              novel thin film electroluminescent (TFEL) technology  based on porous
              polysilicon films.  Such a technology would be not  only more economical and
              practical than conventional practice, but  could also offer the monolithic
              integration of display elements  with the thin film transistor (TFT)
              chip-on-glass driver circuits.  ***
