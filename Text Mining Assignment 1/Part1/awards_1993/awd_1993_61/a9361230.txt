Abstract    :
              9361230  Ting      Beryllium is a candidate material for applications requiring
              low density, strength, and/or thermal performance, such as space structures,
              heat shields, radiators, and nuclear fusion reactor first wall components. 
              However, the use of beryllium is limited by its moderate thermal conductivity
              and brittleness, both of which result in a low thermal shock fracture
              toughness.  This also places a limitation on the thickness of a beryllium
              component, which can impose limits in lifetime for application such as Be
              plasma facing tiles.  It is proposed to develop a graphite-fiber-reinforced
              beryllium composite which will manifest the advantages of both beryllium and
              carbon/carbon composites, and which will ameliorate the disadvantages of either
              one.  A preliminary experiment has suggested the advantages of using highly
              graphitic fiber to eliminate or reduce  interface reaction.  The graphite fiber
              proposed for use is vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF), which is the most
              graphitic fiber know to be available.  In the proposed fabricate the
              composites.  Effort will be directed toward examining interphase formation, if
              any, between  VGCF and Be, and demonstrating a VGCF/Be composite with improved
              thermal and mechanical properties.  ***
