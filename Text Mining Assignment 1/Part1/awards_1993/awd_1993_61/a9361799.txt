Abstract    :
                9361799  Dixon  Analytical techniques, based on fluorescent lifetime
              measurements are currently being  developed for applications in clinical
              chemistry and biological research.  By measuring  the phase of the fluorescent
              emission from a sample relative to that of an RF-modulated  excitation source,
              it is possible to accurately determine the fluorescent decay  rate.  Although
              sensitive phase fluorometers have been constructed in a number of  research
              laboratories, they require the use of large, expensive laser sources to excite
              the  fluorescent sample.  The commercial introduction of a phase fluorometer
              requires the  development of compact, efficient laser sources with the correct
              combination of output  power, wavelength and modulation bandwidth.   
              Diode-pumped, intracavity sum frequency lasers can be modulated at rates up to
              1 GHz  and are capable of producing output powers in the blue and green that
              are greater than  25 mW.  In this Phase I SBIR program we will investigate the
              feasibility of using a sum  frequency laser to excite the sample in a phase
              fluormeter.  A 490 nm sum frequency  laser will be built and its modulation
              bandwidth and output power determined.  The  source will then be imaged into a
              commercial fluorescence microscope and the  modulation depth of the fluorescent
              output determined as a function of input frequency.  ***
