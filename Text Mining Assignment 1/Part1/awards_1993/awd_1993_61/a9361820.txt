Abstract    :
              9361820  Siu  Millimeter-wave technology is finding  use in many commercial
              applications   including communications, resource  monitoring,
              collision-avoidance, and   security/surveillance systems. Essential  to these
              applications is efficient  power  generation at millimeter-wave  frequencies.
              Present GaAs- and InP-  based  modulation-doped field effect  transistors
              (MODFETs/HEMTs), in spite  of good  small signal gain and low  noise figure at
              94 GHz, are however not  suitable for  power applications. Major  deficiencies
              of present "power"  MODFETs include low  power gain and  breakdown voltage. A
              nanometer-scale  self-aligned gate with  separately  controllable gate-source
              and gate-drain  spacings will enhance both  gate-drain  breakdown and power
              gain. Microwave  Monolithics Incorporated  (MMlnc.) and  its subcontractor the
              University of  California at San Diego  (UCSO)  propose to exploit the advanced
               nanofabrication technique for high   performance millimeter-wave power 
              devices, and concurrently use the   nanofabricated structures to study  carrier
              transport properties such as   velocity overshoot in realistic materials  and
              device systems. The combination   of nanometer-scale asymmetric self-  aligned
              gates and advanced  heterostructure  materials will result in  high power, high
              gain millimeter-wave  devices and  circuits. The scientific  knowledge and data
              gained by the  proposed studies  will also be valuable  to the design of future
              generation high  frequency and  high speed  components.
