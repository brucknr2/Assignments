Abstract    :
              9361317  Shook    This nation has more than 11 million manholes which now need
              or soon will need to be rehabilitated.  Current techniques are either too
              costly or do not last.  This research speaks to this problem through
              development of an innovative technique of restoring many of these structures at
              less than half the cost of the reliable methods available today.  The concept
              uses a newly developed applicator which can apply combinations of portland,
              high-alumina, or polymer cements.  Fundamental to the requirement of a repair
              which lasts more than a few months is application of sufficient thickness of a
              strong but inexpensive cement which when needed can be protected with a coating
              of chemically resistant material such as latex or urethane.  Key to the
              proposed process is the ability of the applicator to place uniform thicknesses
              of cement of sufficient thickness without costly forms and wither the need for
              people to enter the manhole.  The latter not only reduces costs but improves
              safety.
