Abstract    :
              9361123  Lyon    This project focuses on development of a liquid absorbent for 
              the separation of isobutylene by thermal- and pressure-swing  absorption
              processes.  The absorbent will contain transition  metal complexes which are
              expected to have a high selectivity  for isobutylene over other C4 components. 
                Isobutylene is an important precursor for gasoline additives  and tires. 
              Low-energy methods for the separation of  isobutylene from natural gas liquids
              and from petroleum  derivatives can reduce production costs to make the
              processes  more profitable and competitive.  ***
