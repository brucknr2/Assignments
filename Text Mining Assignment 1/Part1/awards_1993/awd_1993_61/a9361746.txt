Abstract    :
              9361746  Casstevens    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is
              in the general area of analytical and  surface chemistry and in the subfield of
              biosensors. The main Phase I objective is the  development of a fluoropolymer
              based immunoprobe where biological recognition elements are  immobilized onto
              the surface of a transparent film of polytetrafluoroethylene-co- 
              hexafluoropropylene (FEP). The advantages of an FEP-based probe are better
              biocompatibility  and less denaturation or loss of activity of the antibody
              protein induced by traditional glass or  quartz substrates. Three areas which
              will be explored in order to optimize the surface chemistry  are (1) initial
              surface modification which incorporates reactive surface hydroxyl functionality
              to   a film of FEP; (2) a comparison of monofunctional vs difunctional covalent
              linking ligands; and  (3) evaluation of the density and activity of the
              antibody protein and its effect on the  fluorescence response.  %%%  More than
              four billion dollars are spent annually on immunochemical based analyses.  The 
              successful development of a versatile fluoropolymer immunoprobe will provide
              the basis for   their incorporation into a wide range of devices that are
              sensitive, economical and compatible  with fiber optic technology.  ***
