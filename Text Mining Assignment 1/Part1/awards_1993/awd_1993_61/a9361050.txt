Abstract    :
              9361050  Spielberg    This project is to design and test an interactive
              environment  that will enable the appropriate applications expert to set up a 
              solution scheme, provide the data, and monitor the execution for  a given class
              of problems.  In order to deal with the high  intrinsic combinatorial
              complexity of the problems, solution  schemes will be designed for execution on
              parallel computing  systems.  This will involve trade-offs between algorithmic
              and  computer related considerations so that the application code is  adapted
              to all exigencies.  Parallel computing will also be  essential for a truly
              interactive system so that response times  are acceptable during the testing of
              moderately large problems.    Significant enhancements have resulted from
              related technologies.  The successful development of this project will give
              additional  impetus to such trends.  ***
