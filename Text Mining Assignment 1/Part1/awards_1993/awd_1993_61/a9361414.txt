Abstract    :
              9361414  Hilliard  The useful life of engine oil is known to be highly dependent
              on  formulation and the engine operating mode.  Consequently, an oil-  change
              interval based on miles traveled or engine operating hours  does not
              necessarily define the in-service quality of the oil.    One problem in
              particular for diesel engines is that oil  dispersancy can fail very rapidly,
              this enables the suspended  soot particles to "gel" the oil even when the
              actual suspended  soot particles are only present at a 1% to 2% (w/v) 
              concentration.  The result of gelling is increased viscosity,  poor cold-start
              protection, more soot abrasion wear and loss of  lubricity.  Dispersancy of an
              oil can be lost when all other oil  properties, eg. oxidative resistance, are
              still 90% intact.  Some  engine operating schedules - notably high-load to
              low-load  excursions - can lead to total dispersancy loss in less than 100 
              hours of operation.    The proposed Phase 1 research is directed at using
              scattering of  intra-red radiation as a means of detecting the transition from 
              well-dispersed particles to the agglomerates that form as  dispersancy fails. 
              The wavelength source is chosen to match the  effective scattering diameter of
              the particles and agglomerates  in such a way that the transition can be
              detected as a deviation  from classical Rayleigh scattering behavior.  ***
