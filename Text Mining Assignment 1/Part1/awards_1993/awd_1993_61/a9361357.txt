Abstract    :
              9361357 Barnes          The research objective will be to conduct a feasibility
              study.  This study will be conducted with the following specific objectives in
              mind.  1) Identify the components contained in the state of the art (LCD) Life
              Cycle Design technology that have applications in medical device design. 
              Decide what classes of medical devices would benefit from such technology.  2) 
              Study the possibility of enhancing and adapting these practices to medical
              device.  3)  Investigate the implications of the current device law and
              identify the issues that will effect the design and development of such
              devices.  Begin to form guidelines for documentation and design that integrate
              these findings.  4)  Become aware of the trends and possible direction of
              future legislation in order to keep modularity and adaptability of the end
              product a reality.  5)  Gather input from current medical device manufactures
              in order to get a feel for their current design practices and what they could
              really use and need as an end product.  6) Study the possibility of
              implementing state of the art telecommunications such that the end product
              could act as the link between the designers/manufacturers and the regulating
              body.  Investigate any related database and artificial intelligence systems
              that have analogous applications.  7) Begin to narrow the structure of the
              above objectives and focus on the relevant issues.  Prepare a model design
              "walk through" of an example medical device.          Accomplishing these
              objectives would provide the necessary background information required to start
              specifying the actual design tool.  These goals are rather academic in nature
              but relate directly to the innova tive aspects of the identified opportunity. 
              This feasibility study will shape the follow on research needed as well as
              providing substantiated results that will be useful in soliciting commercial
              funds.
