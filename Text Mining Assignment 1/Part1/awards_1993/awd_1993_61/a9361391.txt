Abstract    :
              9361391  Arya  Thermal management is one of the  critical aspects in the design
              of  the 2 and 3 dimensional multichip   modules (MCM's) to ensure  reliability
              at increased functional  densities in electronic devices.  Diamond  has the
              highest know  thermal conductivity and yet is an  electrical insulator. It is
              proposed  to deposit high quality diamond  films on high thermal conductivity 
              metal matrix composite heat sinks  which will allow  powder dissipation  of
              several hundreds of watts in the  advance MCM packaging concepts.  Recent 
              developments in fullerene  chemistry show that the carbon atoms  in the
              pentagons of the spheroidal   molecules of C60, C70, etc are  predominantly Sp3
              hydribdized and  are sterically fairly close to the  diamond.  MER has
              demonstrated that  a small amount of rearrangement of  these atoms in highly
              energetic  plasma  can result in transformation  of fullerenes into diamond.
              This  unique fullerene vapor phase  precursor  process will be  demonstrated
              and optimized to  produce will bonded, high quality  thin and thick diamond 
              films at  very high growth rates and at low  temperatures on the MMC and other 
              electronic substrates.  Single,  hybrid and magnetically enhanced  plasma
              systems will be investigated  along with different plasma  gas  chemistries to
              produce  polycrystalline diamond films as  well as free standing film of 
              geological size  and quality diamond  which will establish a basis for  Phase
              II optimization and scale-up  to economically  produce diamond  films.  ***
