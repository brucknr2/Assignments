Abstract    :
              9361715  Kane   We propose to develop an instrument that would completely
              characterize (measure the intensity and phase) two ultrashort laser pulses
              simultaneously, ultimately in a single shot, which would facilitate measurement
              of low energy ultrashort pulses, help to characterize ultrashort laser systems,
              and would also allow sub-pulse dynamics to be resolved.  The proposed device is
              based on a newly invented technique to measure the intensity and phase of
              ultrashort light pulses called frequently-resolved optical gating (FROG). 
              However, rather than use the pulse to gate itself via the optical Kerr effect,
              the proposed technique uses an unknown pulse to gate a different unknown pulse.
               Like FROG, the gated pulse is spectrally resolved for a series of time delays.
               The intensity and phase of both pulses is found by using two-dimensional phase
              retrieval methods that are commonly used in astronomy and image processing to
              deblur images.  This device would not only measure pulses, but would provide
              insight into ultrafast laser operation as well and hence allow them to be used
              more easily and more effectively.   Immediate commercial applications are
              directed toward use as a diagnostic for existing ultrafast laser systems for
              which few are currently available.  Future commercial applications include use
              as research tool for industry, academia, and government.  ***   v       s  t
