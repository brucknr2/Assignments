Abstract    :
              9361046  Livesey  The objective of the project is to determine whether full 
              thickness composite skin can be reproduced in a relatively  short time.  The
              investigator aims to culture keratinocytes  onto a processed dermal matrix,
              AlloDerm, which is currently  under investigation as a foundation for a thin
              split-  thickness skin graft.    Investigations will focus first on optimizing
              growth under  standard conditions and then in co-culture with dermis.  Co- 
              culture conditions will be assessed for the impact on wound  healing in the
              nude mouse model.  ***
