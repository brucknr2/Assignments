Abstract    :
              9361410  Dawes  During  the  last few years, Martingale Research Corporation 
              has  been actively developing a neural network architecture called the 
              Parametric    Avalanche   Scholastic   Filter.    This    network  architecture
               was  developed to solve difficult problems  dealing  with nonlinear dynamical
              systems.  MRC is currently applying this  network   architecture  to  automatic
               recognition   of   speech.  Additionally,  Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
              University  is  actively  conducting research in the field of acoustic emission
              in  various  structures, particularly as applied to fatigue monitoring.    MRC
              and Embry-Riddle propose to apply the Parametric Avalanche to  the  problem  of
               unambiguous  detection  and  classification  of  acoustic   emissions 
              resulting  from  crack  growth   in   metal  structures  subject  to  fatigue 
              cycling.   We  will  apply  the  Parametric  Avalanche  neural network 
              technology  developed  for  speech  recognition  to  noisy acoustic emission 
              data  with  the  specific  goal of demonstrating a proof-of-concept  that  can 
              be  further  developed into a prototype real-time fatigue  crack  and 
              classification system.  ***
