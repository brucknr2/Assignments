Abstract    :
                  9361272  Lian    Real Time thin film holographic elements are crucial
              components in a number of optical data processing technologies.  There is a
              need for development of materials to record both permanent and re configurable
              holograms.  Recently, polymeric photo refractive materials have evoked a lot of
              interest as inexpensive holographic media.  We propose to develop a new class
              of polymeric photo refractive materials which are expected to surpass the
              polymeric photo refractive materials so far reported both in speed and
              sensitivity.  The polymeric materials proposed in this work are conjugated
              polymers which have characteristics of a semiconductor.  These polymers are
              functionalized with second order nonlinear optical chromophores and cross
              linking groups to provide stable second order nonlinerity after poling and
              cross linking.  Charge transport and dielectric constant can be tailored by
              appropriate choice of dopants.    The photo refractive polymer synthesized will
              be purified and processed into thin films.  These materials will be
              characterized for their linear and nonlinear optical properties and photo
              conductivity.  Diffraction efficiency measurements will be performed to
              evaluate these materials as a dynamic holographic medium.
