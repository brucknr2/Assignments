Abstract    :
                  9361299  Tekula    Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) can sometimes be used as
              a diagnostic device in  biology and medicine.  In general, LIF has difficulties
              in relating the fluorescence spectra  to the concentration of the emitters
              within the tissue, in identifying different species, and  in the possibility of
              destroying the molecules being probed if the wrong excitation  wavelength is
              chosen.  Many of the problems associated with fluorescence can be  eliminated
              by the use of Raman scattering.  Raman techniques allow the measurement  of
              multiple species even in aqueous solutions (not accessible by infra-red methods
               because of water absorption). However, spontaneous Raman techniques give very
              weak  signals. Signal enhancement is possible by utilizing resonance Raman
              techniques. Both of  these methods still suffer from the fact that spatial and,
              to some extent, temporal  information is lost.    The research in this proposal
              is intended to investigate a non-invasive, real-time, high   resolution device
              for the detection of enzyme levels, metabolite concentrations or other 
              critical molecules in single biological cells. This unique device is based on
              stimulated  Raman scattering and can simultaneously measure the concentrations
              and temporal  evolution of several different molecular species.
