Abstract    :
              9361524  Stubberud    The artificial neural network (ANN) has been used with
              varying degrees of success in the feed back loop to provide the necessary
              control for nonlinear or uncertain systems.  Recently, research has been done
              to train a neuro-controller, as well as a neuro-observer, using a relatively
              new extended Kalman filter (EKF) training paradigm.  However, both functions
              have not been implemented with ANNs, which train on-line.  ORINCON will
              investigate the capability of implementing a neuro-controller and
              neuro-observer on-line using the EKF paradigm.  All systems encounter parameter
              variations over time from their nominal design that the control must adapt to
              or be robust enough to handle.  This research will allow the entire feedback
              loop to be adjusted for parameter changes.  ***
