Abstract    :
              9361988  tsve    ZnGeP2 single crystals have outstanding nonlinear and optical
              properties that make them the most attractive candidate for optical parametric
              oscillators and amplifiers capable of producing tunable laser radiation in the
              2.5 to 13 um region.   The development of ZnGep2 crystals has been hampered by
              synthesis methods that are not capable of providing the required precise
              stoichiometry and high purity, by an anomalous absorption between 1 and 3 um,
              and also by al lack of data on the pressure-temperature-composition of the
              Zn-Ge-P system.    In Phase I we propose to use a new two-temperature synthesis
              to prepare ZnGeP2 samples o f varying composition above and below the exact
              stoichimetric point and to characterized them with respect to accurate
              elemental composition, optical transmission, lattice constants, resistivity and
              photoconductivity.  An important objective will be to understand the nature of
              the 1 to 3 um absorption and to find out how to eliminate it.
