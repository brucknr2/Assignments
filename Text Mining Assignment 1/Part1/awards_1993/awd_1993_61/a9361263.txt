Abstract    :
              9361263  Bowen  Several methods are currently being developed for the production
              of  surface-relief diffractive optics including photolithography,  single-point
              diamond turning, and single-point laserwriting.  All  of these methods are
              limited in either the achievable geometries or  minimum feature size.  In order
              to realize the full commercial  potential of diffractive optics and
              subwavelength structured  surfaces, it is necessary to create structures that
              consist of  smaller features.  We propose to investigate the use of near-field 
              scanning optical lithography (NSOL) for the fabrication of  diffractive
              structures that can be used at high numerical aperture  and short wavelengths. 
              Near-field scanning can create structures  well below that produced by
              conventional projection lithography.   In order to fabricate useful macroscopic
              optical devices, it is  necessary to increase throughput and extend the
              manufacturable  dimensions of NSOL.  This capability will serve to advance
              optical  technology in the areas of UV optical systems, optical data storage 
              and subwavelength structured optics.  The ability to fabricate  nanometer-sized
              structures will also be useful for applications in  X-ray instruments and
              micromachining.  We have identified  commercial applications in document
              security and polarization  components.    ***
