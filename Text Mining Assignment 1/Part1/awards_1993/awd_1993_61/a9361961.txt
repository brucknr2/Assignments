Abstract    :
              9361961  Leyva  BBO and LBO class materials will be studied for possible 
              application as UV sensitive photorefractive materials.  Undoped  samples of BBO
              and LBO will be doped by high temperature diffusion  with various transition
              metal species to determine their  suitability for storing high efficiency
              holographic gratings.   Oxidation and reduction heat treatments will be carried
              out on the  resulting materials to optimize their photorefractive properties.  
              The results will be used to determine the optimum material and  dopant
              configuration for a future crystal growth effort.  ***
