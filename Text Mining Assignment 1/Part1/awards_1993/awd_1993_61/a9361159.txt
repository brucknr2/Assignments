Abstract    :
              9361159 Lewis  This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's
              (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to
              provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small high
              technology firm, to participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the SBIR program
              serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can
              do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase
              III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications
              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or
              other non-federal financing.  The focus of this Phase I project is to analyze a
              cellular channelizer/equalizer/detector, called the Athena Cellular Telephone. 
              The technology is based on DS-CDMA protocol, a synergistic (patent pending)
              arithmetic processor design, and a highly integrated receiver design.  The
              planned result is an extremely compact, single-chip DS-CDMA receiver which
              contains digital mixers, downconverters, and adaptive equalizers.***
