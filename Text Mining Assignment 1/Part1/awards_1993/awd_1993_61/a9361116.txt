Abstract    :
              9361116  Koh  Microorganisms are primarily responsible for the degradation of 
              toxic chemicals that enter the environment.  Successful isolation  and
              exploitation of these microbes for bioremediation requires  identifying the
              physico-chemical conditions under which  detoxification activity is maximized. 
              This work proposes to  develop an analytical diffusion gradient chamber that
              mimics the  diffusive processes that prevail in the microbial world.  This 
              system can be used to separate, enrich for, and isolate detoxifying 
              microorganisms, as well as study the behavior of , and  detoxification
              processes mediated by, these organisms.  The  proposed system will consist of a
              gradient chamber for culturing  microorganisms in multiple, continuous
              diffusion gradients of small  soluble molecules.  In addition there will be an
              effluent chamber  for consolidating effluent flow from the system, an
              environmental  control unit of maintaining constant temperature, and an imaging
               unit to monitor and quantify  microbial growth and movement.  These 
              components will be developed by Koh Development, Inc.  The system  will be
              tested and evaluated by Koh Development with help from  researchers at Michigan
              State University (MSU).  The scientists at  MSU will also use the system to
              evaluate the chemotactic response  of an individual bacterial species to
              multiple chemical cues.  In  addition, gradients of salt and toluene will be
              used to evaluate  the response of a natural community from a soil site
              contaminated  with oil brine.  Mathematical models will also be developed that 
              aid in optimizing the performance of the system.
