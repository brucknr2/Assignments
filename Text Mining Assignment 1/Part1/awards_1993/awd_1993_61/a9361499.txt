Abstract    :
              9361499 Sumerak          The pultrusion process is a continuous method for the
              manufacture of composite profiles employing either thermoset or thermoplastic
              polymer matrices.  Pultruded products are noted for high fiber volume contents
              relative to products are noted for high fiber volume contents relative to
              products made by alternative composite processes making them materials of
              choice in many structural applications.  The well established thermoset
              technology, which represents nearly the entire current commercial market, is
              limited to product geometries of constant cross section relative to the linear
              machine direction with not opportunity for subsequent reforming.  Thermoplastic
              pultrusion technology, while in its infancy, does allow for limited geometry
              reforming after primary molding, however, the cost of raw material and
              processing steps is severely cost prohibitive for most applications.  Such
              reforming capability is desirable in order to introduce flangers, offsets, and
              bosses for example which can provide secondary structure for load transfer and
              improved joint efficiency.  This research project investigates the feasibility
              of a thermoset pultrusin process modification which allows for continuous
              production of variable cross section profiles.  The feasibility of this process
              will be established through process modeling employing Finite Element Analysis
              techniques and verified through process simulation.          Commercial
              opportunities are numerous for both new products as well as cost reduced
              structures currently employing traditional fabrication and fastening methods,
              such as troughs, wireways, conduits, tension, members, oil well sucker rods and
              structural profile s.
