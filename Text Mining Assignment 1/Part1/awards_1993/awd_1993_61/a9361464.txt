Abstract    :
              93-61464  Flaming        The advent of highly fluorescent cation specific probes
              coupled  with video imaging technologies has led to a sure of interest in 
              photometric measurement of ion distributions in single living  cells.  Of
              particular interest has been the quantitation of  cytosolic fee calcium
              concentrations ( Ca2+ i) utilizing the  fluorescent dye Fura-2 and dual
              wavelength ratio imaging.  One of  the current technical difficulties
              encountered, but an important  goal for  Ca2+ i ratio imaging, is the ability
              to perform real-  time imaging (i.e. video frame rates of 30 frames per
              second).  When using Fura-2, the ability to follow fast changes in  Ca2+ i  can
              be limited by the rate at which the excitation wavelengths  are chopped.  If
              ratioing is to be done in real time, the  requirement if that the excitation
              wavelength be switched within  the vertical blanking period of a video signal
              (1200).    The intent of this project is to develop a high speed UV- 
              wavelength switching (excitation) system for real time optical  imaging of the
              nervous system.  This Phase I proposal will  specifically address the
              feasibility of utilizing a dual scanning  galvanometer system to switch between
              multiple interference  filters.  ***
