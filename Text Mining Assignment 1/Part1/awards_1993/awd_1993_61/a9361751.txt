Abstract    :
              9361751 Farrelle   This project is funded under the National Science
              Foundation's (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is
              designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small
              high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the SBIR
              program serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the
              firm can do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal research project.
               Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial
              applications and technological innovation supported by follow-on private
              venture capital or other non-federal financing.  This Phase I project studies
              the feasibility of a generic architecture concept utilizing a library of
              fundamental building blocks which can be combined to compress multiple image
              sources.  Potential building blocks include predictors, DCTs, DSTs, quantizers,
              entropy coders, and buffers. The project is determining the feasibility of
              programming a commercially-available digital video processor chip developed for
              real-time video imagery for compression of other types of imagery.***
