Abstract    :
              9361656  Pei    There is growing interest in commercializing conducting polymers
              as new conductive materials and very recently for use as the active layer in
              light-emitting diodes, making new processable conducting polymers highly
              desirable.  We propose the synthesis of a novel water-soluble and self-dopable
              conducting polymer poly (2-hydroxparaphenylene, sodium salt) (II).  Charge
              delocalization in this polymer from the side-group oxygen anion into the
              conjugated polymer main chain is expected to occur, leading to an intrinsically
              conductive polymer without doping.  This will be the first example of
              processable and tractable n-type conducting polymers.  It is expected that this
              polymer will show strong fluorescence which, combined with its intrinsic
              conductivity, will lead to a high electoluminescent quantum-efficiency for
              light-emitting diodes.
