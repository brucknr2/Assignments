Abstract    :
              9361544  Markham  Advanced Fuel Research Inc. (AFR) has pioneered a technique to
               determine temperatures along a "line-of-sight" into transparent  materials. 
              It involves measuring infrared radiance spectra, for  materials with
              well-characterized, temperature-dependent optical  constants.  The objective
              this proposal is to demonstrate that  Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR)
              radiance spectra can be used  to extract the average temperature at the
              slurry-sample interface  during micromachining processes.  Feasibility will be 
              demonstrated by performing FT-IR radiance measurements through  samples to the
              slurry interface, for two systems:  colloidal  silica lapping of sapphire, and
              diamond lapping of silicon.  The  latter case represents the dicing of silicon
              wafers.  At present  there is no way to measure the slurry-sample interface 
              temperature during micromachining.  The successful completion of  Phases 1 and
              11 would lead to an on-line process monitor for the  micromachining of
              single-crystal ceramics, as well as to  increased understanding of the
              processes involved.  ***
