Abstract    :
                9361440  Bartz  Root research is conducted to improve the drought resistance
              of food crops, to study  root response to soil conditions and contamination,
              and for research on disease  mechanisms.  Improving food production is of major
              importance in the United States and  a matter of survival in many third world
              countries.    Early studies correlated the roots observed in these views with
              samples of roots dug up  destructively in soil samples and meticulously washed
              and measured.  Recent system-  improvements cut the average time to take each
              picture and increased the amount of  data that could be gathered by 500%.  New
              cameras allow higher magnification for  viewing fungi and micro organisms. 
              More accurate movement of the microscope is  needed.    This research will
              apply computer control and automation to the video microscope in  order to:   
              1.  Decrease the time and labor required to gather the photographs.  2. 
              Improve the accuracy of registration so the photo is of the same place.  3. 
              Make the index depth intervals easily adjustable in the program.  4.  Improve
              the marking of each picture to take the data back off the tape         faster
              and with less operator input.  5.  Produce a system designed for an attainable
              price.  ***
