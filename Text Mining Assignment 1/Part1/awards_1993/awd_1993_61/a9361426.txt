Abstract    :
              9361795  Lee       Metal matrix composites (MMC), with their high thermal  
              conductivity, light weight, EMI shielding, and tailorable   coefficient of
              thermal expansion (CTE) are the emerging materials   of choice for heat sink,
              constraining core and packaging   applications.  Affordable and timely
              manufacturing methods are   desired for small lots of electronic packaging
              applications such as   microwave T/R module and multichip modules (MCM's).     
                              In this research the purpose is to combine composite 
              processing and the tooling fabrication to develop flexible  manufacturing
              methods for small production runs of high performance  MMC electronic packages.
               A prototype MMC MCM's will be designed to   test the feasibility of using
              solid freeform fabrication (SFF)   models to generate tooling for rapid
              prototyping of MMC packages.   Near-net-shape manufacturing of the composite
              packages will be   demonstrated.  Properties of MMC packages such as CTE,
              thermal   conductivity, modulus, density, surface finish and dimensional  
              tolerance will be characterized.  In addition to the high   performance
              electronic packaging applications, metal matrix  composites  will have
              commercial applications as heat exchangers,  engine components, and possible
              applications in sport equipments.
