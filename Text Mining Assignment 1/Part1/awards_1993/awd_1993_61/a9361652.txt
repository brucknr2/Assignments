Abstract    :
              9361652  Feng    A very large number of science and engineering courses taught
              in colleges and universities today do not involve laboratories.  Although good
              instructors incorporate class demonstrations, hands on homework, and various
              teaching aids, including computer simulations, the fact is that students in
              such courses often accept key concepts and experimental results without
              discovery them for themselves.  The only partial solution to this problem has
              been increasing use of class demonstrations and computer simulations.   
              Protein Solutions propose the development of a completely self contained
              polymer materials laboratory which, although packaged like a textbook, will
              contain within it all of the materials, equipment, and information needed to
              directly discover and experience key concepts related to polymer materials. 
              Protein Solutions expect that such a Labless Lab Book will be widely adopted a
              a supplement to the more conventional polymer science and engineering
              textbooks, particularly in those courses which do not have a laboratory section
              or component.    Protein Solutions expect to eventually expand this approach to
              a wide variety of science and engineering courses.  It is appropriate to begin
              with polymer materials, however, because polymeric materials are so readily
              available for a wide variety of applications and because they exhibit a range
              of phenomena which are very easy to observe, experience, and discover.  ***
