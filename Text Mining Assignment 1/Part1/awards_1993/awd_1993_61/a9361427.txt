Abstract    :
              9361427  Langford         Atmospheric science platforms of all types require a
              reliable  and cost-effective means of communicating with home laboratories.  
              Current satellite techniques suffer from low data rates, excessive  latencies,
              high costs, or other complications.  A new generation of  low-altitude
              commercial data relay satellites offers attractive  opportunities to improve
              over-the-horizon telemetry and  telecommand.  Aurora Flight Sciences proposes
              to develop and  demonstrate and atmospheric science data link using Orbital 
              Sciences Corporation's ORBCOMM satellite system.  While Aurora's  work will be
              directed towards data relay requirements for aircraft  and balloons, it will be
              applicable to a broad range of science  pursuits including buoys and ground
              stations.  ***
