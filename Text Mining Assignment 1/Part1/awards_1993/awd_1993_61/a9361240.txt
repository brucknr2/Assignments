Abstract    :
              9361240  Dreizin       From spot welding to soldering, joining metal wires to
              one   another or to substrates is a major part of the assembly process   for
              electrical and electronic devices.  This program will develop   an entirely new
              method for welding such joints using filler metals.   In this novel method,
              50-500 micrometer diameter monodisperse   droplets of high temperature filler
              metal are generated remotely   and then transported and deposited at the joint
              to be welded.    Since there is no direct contact between the energy source and
              weld   site, thermal or electrical damage to components is eliminated.   
              Droplet size and temperature can be controlled so that the weld can   be
              tailored to specific requirements.  Almost any metal can serve   as weld
              filler, including refractories.  Welds of copper and   aluminum wires to
              aluminum and silicon plates (copper or aluminum   filler) and of tungsten wires
              to tungsten or molybdenum plates   (tungsten or molybdenum filler) will be
              made.  The weld strengths   will be measured and correlated with experimental
              parameters such   as droplet metal identity, size, and temperature.        This
              new method for making permanent electrical and electronic   connections will be
              useful for applications requiring high   durability connections such as for
              printed circuit boards for use   in vibrating or accelerating environments or
              for attaching lamp   filaments to base connections.  The technique could
              replace   environmentally unsatisfactory solders in many electrical and  
              electronic assembly processes.
