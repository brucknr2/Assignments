Abstract    :
                        9361143  COLEMAN  This project will develop wind turbine technology
              for polar  applications as an avenue to expanding the ability to  develop wind
              and wind hybrid energy projects in cold weather  and polar environments.  The
              development program will be  focused on the identification of technical
              problems,  specifically related to the polar environment, and  performing
              analysis, detailed engineering and conceptual  designs to address the specific
              set of identified concerns.  The outcome of the program will be the development
              of wind  turbines for a wide range of commercial cold regions  applications. 
              These new turbines will fill a void in the  current marketplace, and may make a
              significant reduction in  cost of electrical energy in polar regions.  ***
