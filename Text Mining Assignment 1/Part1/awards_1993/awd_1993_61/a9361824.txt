Abstract    :
              9361824  Smith    The project addresses the key requirements for effective 
              Software Performance Engineering (SPE) tool support.  It  evaluates three
              candidate architectures for SPE support that  interface with both CASE tools
              and performance modeling  tools to capitalize on existing technology.  It
              identifies  the key technical solutions that will make an SPE  architecture
              feasible; a performance meta-model that defies  SPE requirements for a variety
              of CASE and performance  modeling tools; a Performance Model Interchange Format
               (PMIF) to exchange information between various performance  modeling tools.   
                   The results of this project will enable vendors of  existing products to
              provide true SPE design decision  support with a minimum investment in time,
              development and  maintenance.  The resulting tools will reduce the time and 
              effort for developers to use SPE, thus improving reliability  and reducing
              costs.  ***
