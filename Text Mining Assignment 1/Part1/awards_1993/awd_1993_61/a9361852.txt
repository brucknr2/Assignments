Abstract    :
              9361852  Mendoza  The commercial realization of the promise of integrated optics
               technology depends on the establishment of a cost-effective,  reliable method
              of fabricating active and passive waveguiding  structures in a thin film
              format.  Physical Optics Corporation  (POC) proposes to investigate the
              development of a novel  photolithographic technique that uses commonly
              available materials,  and straightforward processing, to produce both active
              and passive  waveguides in silica-based sol-gel films.  The proposed technique 
              offers the possibility of "writing" permanent index variations of  up to 0.1
              into the silica matrix.  Furthermore, the same technique  can be used to
              produce waveguides with nonlinearities in refractive  index and transmissivity.
               During the proposed Phase I effort, POC  will prove the practicality of this
              technique by using it to  generate examples of planar waveguides, channel
              waveguides, and  active and passive devices such as splitters, combiners, 
              directional couplers, and Mach-Zender interferometers on a single  glass
              substrate.  ***
