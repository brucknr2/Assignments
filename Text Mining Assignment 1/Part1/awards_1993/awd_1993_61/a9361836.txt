Abstract    :
              9361836  Bachalo    Funded by an SBIR Phase 1 grant, research will be conducted
              on a novel atomizer primarily for oil-fired burners.  The atomizer is based on
              evervescent atomization, is which air is introduced into the bulk fuel flow in
              the atomizer nozzle.  This concept differs form earlier research with
              evervescent breakup of a liquid through differences in various details of the
              configuration.    The research will be useful for scaling up the atomizer for
              practical boiler combustion, and through an increased understanding of
              evervescent atomization.  ***
