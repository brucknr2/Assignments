Abstract    :
              Wafer scale, nonvolatile, magnetorsisitive memories with parallel  search
              capability and caching capability are being analyzed and  experimentally
              verified in this project.  Because magnetoresistive  memories are nonvolatile,
              are very dense, and can be made very  fast, they are well suited for storage of
              large nonvolatile files  such as those in data bases.  The inclusion of
              searching hardware  on each active die of a wafer can speed up search by a
              factor of  10,000.  In addition, on-board caching can speed up general purpose 
              read-write operations, allowing the wafer scale memory to replace  all
              components of a contemporary memory hierarchy.  In this  project, an optimum
              allocation of chip area to memory, cache, and  search hardware is being
              determined.  Power and bus performance for  a typical system is being verified
              experimentally.
