Abstract    :
              9361115  Boyers  The objective of this research is to explore the feasibility of
              developing a high intensity UV excimer source for the demanding requirements of
              the semiconductor manufacturing and materials processing industry.  Emerging
              processing technologies not requiring a coherent source including UV wafer
              cleaning and photo CVD will require very high UV intensities over large areas
              (100mW/cm@) currently only available from excimer lasers.  Conventional UV
              lamps are inadequate for the task.  Excimer lasers cannot conveniently
              illuminate a large field size, are often difficult to integrate into a
              production tool, and have a very high cost of ownership.  The phase I research
              will be directed toward establishing the feasibility of developing a UV excimer
              lamp and excitation source with the required performance : 1)  A lamp and
              excitation source will be designed and fabricated.  2) The spectrum and UV
              efficiency will be measured with pure Xe (172 nm). 3) A preliminary full scale
              design and cost estimate will be prepared.  The Phase II research will be
              directed toward the construction of a full scale prototype for operation with
              other excimer gas mixtures such as ArFl*(193 nm), KrCL* (222 nm), KrF* (249
              nm), and XeCl* (351 nm). If successful, this program will lead to the
              development of a critical manufacturing resource for use in the fabrication of
              the next generation of semiconductor devices.    ***
