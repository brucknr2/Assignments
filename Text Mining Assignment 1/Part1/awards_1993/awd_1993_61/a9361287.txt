Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: 9361287  PI Last Name: Marchal    The innovative use of
              computers offers an opportunity to  dramatically improve the learning and
              teaching of ordinary  differential equations (ODEs).  The challenge is to
              identify an  instructional tool that addresses a serious and prevalent problem 
              common to ODE instruction--students' lack of a conceptual framework  necessary
              to analyze and build mathematical models, and to solve  complex problems.  In
              response, IntelliPro proposes to investigate  the feasibility of combining
              mathematical simulation, graphic  animation, and hypermedia to create an
              engaging multimedia learning  environment to significantly enhance students'
              understanding and  working knowledge of ODEs.    The researchers envision
              powerful, easy to use, and pedagogically  meaningful interactive simulation, a
              computer "laboratory" that  will allow students to examine the properties of
              linear and  nonlinear systems, explore and construct realistic mathematical 
              models, and apply intuitive understanding of the behavior of  solutions of ODEs
              to hypothetical and practical situations.  To  determine technical feasibility,
              IntelliPro will (a) identify an  instructional strategy and essential content
              material, (b) design  a software structure and implement a proof-of-concept
              model, and  (c)evaluate the software design, mathematics education, and product
               development, will conduct the research.  ***y
