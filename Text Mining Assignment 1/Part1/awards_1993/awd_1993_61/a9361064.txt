Abstract    :
              9361064  Flannery  We propose to develop a high performance computing
              environment  for large-scale engineering problems, making accessible the most 
              recent advances of parallel computing as a critical component in  everyday
              engineering design.  The success of this work, both  commercially and
              technically, will be based on three elements.  Upon successful completion of
              this work a powerful tool for  simulation of fluid flow will make accessible
              the most recent  advances in parallel computers to large-scale engineering 
              problems in a user-friendly high performance computing  environment.
