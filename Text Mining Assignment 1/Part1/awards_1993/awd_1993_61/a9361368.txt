Abstract    :
              9361368  Klemp    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              is in the general area of  analytical chemical instrumentation. The objective
              of the research is to demonstrate the  feasibility of a high speed gas
              chromatography system. The approach involves the development  of an instrument
              which will use a cryofocusing inlet system capable of preconcentrating a vapor 
              sample and introducing it to the separation column as a very narrow plug. To
              compensate for  the loss of resolution, the instrument will use tandem
              ensembles of capillary columns having  different stationary phases. Computer
              controlled differential adjustment of gas flow rates or  temperatures of the
              individual columns will control selectivity for specific applications. If 
              successful, analysis times of a few seconds should be achieved.  %%%  Gas
              chromatography is widely used for the analysis of chemical process streams,
              environmental  samples and laboratory samples. Significant reductions in
              analysis time will dramatically increase  process monitoring reliability and
              sample throughput.  The proposed high-speed gas  chromatography instrument
              should have broad-based commercial potential.  ***
