Abstract    :
                   PI will perform a taphonomic analysis of plant fossils of the             
              Triassic Chinle Formation to meet two objectives:  1) resolve                  
              controversies regarding climate and other aspects of the physical              
              environment in which flora grew, and 2) demonstrate applicability              
              of taphonomic techniques in environments that differ substantially             
              from those thus far studied.  Research will also contribute to our             
              understanding of world paleoclimate during the time of the                     
              supercontinent, Pangaea.  Through field and lab work, flora will be            
              studied in its geologic context, documenting effects of necrologic,            
              biostratinomic and diagenetic processes, and interpreting their                
              meaning.
