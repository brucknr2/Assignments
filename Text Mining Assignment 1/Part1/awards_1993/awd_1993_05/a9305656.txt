Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The neutron moisture meter and the dual-energy gamma-ray probe are             
              routinely used in hydrological investigations to measure in situ               
              the water content of soils and sediments, even though  the                     
              geometric characteristics of the volumes of influence of these                 
              instruments and their spatial sensitivity are still very poorly                
              understood.  To reach a much better understanding of the physics of            
              water content measurements in heterogeneous soils, and of how it               
              impacts more complicated measurement processes (like the in situ               
              determination of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity) of which              
              soil moisture measurement is only a component, we propose to have              
              recourse to computer simulations on parallel/vector supercomputers.            
              In particular, we propose to use a modified version of the Monte               
              Carlo code MCNP, describing the transport of neutrons and photons              
              in 3-dimensional geometries.  The expected results of this research            
              (which will also extend to other aspects of hydrology besides soil             
              moisture measurement) will allow better use of existing instruments            
              and, eventually (although it is not part of the present proposal),             
              the design of improved ones.
