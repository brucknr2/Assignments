Abstract    :
                   Recent models of the precambrian construction of the                      
              north American craton indicate that the southeastern margin                    
              of the Archean Wyoming craton sustained intense thick-                         
              skinned deformation during an early Proterozoic collision                      
              event at about 1.8Ga.  However, much of  the deformation and                   
              metamorphism of  the Wyoming plate in a wide zone along the                    
              suture has been attributed to Archean deformation.  This                       
              project will re-examine this broad belt and attempt to                         
              separate and partition the deformation and metamorphism into                   
              Archean and early Proterozoic events.  Results will provide                    
              a better understanding of the tectono-metamorphic history of                   
              continental response to Proterozoic convergent margin                          
              tectonics.  It will provide valuable models for this process                   
              that can provide insight into the evolution of similar but                     
              less well exposed regions such as the southern Lake Superior                   
              area.
