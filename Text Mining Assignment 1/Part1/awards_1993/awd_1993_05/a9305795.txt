Abstract    :
              9305795  Quay       Determining the effect of man's activities on the 
              concentration of atmospheric hydroxyl radical is critical to obtain  accurate
              predictions of global change.  Hydroxyl radical levels  determine, to a large
              extent, the capacity of the atmosphere to  oxidize reduced gases.  Many of
              these reduced gases, like  chlorofluorocarbons and methane, are greenhouse
              gases that are  increasing in concentration.  Accurate estimates of present 
              concentrations are an important test for photochemical models used  to predict
              the future levels of greenhouse gases and climate  change.       This project
              is designed to determine the seasonal and  meridional variability of
              atmospheric hydroxyl radical  concentrations through a combination of carbon-14
              labeled carbon  dioxide concentration measurements and modeling.  This work
              will  measure the seasonal trends in atmospheric carbon-14 labeled carbon 
              dioxide concentrations, with samples collected on a biweekly basis,  at a
              marine air site on the coast of Washington State (48 N) and at  a remote site. 
              A 2-D radiative-chemical-transport model will be  used to derive zonally
              averaged hydroxyl radical fields that best  describe the measured seasonal and
              meridional variability in  carbon-14 labeled carbon dioxide.
