Abstract    :
              9305478  Luo    This is a Research Planning Grant that will allow the principal 
              investigator to attend meetings and participate in other activities  that will
              facilitate the preparation of a full proposal in the area  of ferrofluids.  On
              particular interest are the properties of  frozen ferrofluids, which are
              interesting random magnet systems.  %%%  This is a Research Planning Grant that
              will allow the principal  investigator to attend meetings and participate in
              other activities  that will facilitate the preparation of a full proposal in
              the area  of ferrofluids.  Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of magnetic 
              particles which are of great interest both fundamentally and  technologically. 
              They are used in magnetic clutches and can also  serve as friction reduction
              and cooling media in loudspeaker coils.  ***
