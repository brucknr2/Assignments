Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial support for operating the Purdue              
              Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory (PRIME Lab), an accelerator                
              mass spectrometry facility making use of an FN (8 megavolt) tandem             
              accelerator to measure extremely small concentrations of rare                  
              cosmogenic radioactive nuclides of beryllium-10, carbon-14,                    
              aluminum-26, silicon-32, chlorine-36, calcium-41, and iodine-129.              
              The accelerator mass spectrometry technique is uniquely capable of             
              analyzing these isotopes, and PRIME Lab is operated as a national              
              resource for such analyses on behalf of the U.S. geochemical                   
              research community. Accurate measurements of these nuclides in                 
              natural samples enable determination of ages and can also be used              
              as tracers to reconstruct the migration of volumes of the solid                
              earth, oceans, ground and surface waters, and the atmosphere. In-              
              house and outside user projects needing such analyses include                  
              researchers in solid earth sciences, planetary sciences,                       
              atmospheric sciences, ecology, archeology, and a wide range of                 
              applications directed at global change research.
