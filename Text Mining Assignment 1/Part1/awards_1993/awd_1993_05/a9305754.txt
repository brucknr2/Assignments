Abstract    :
                   Assani will investigate problems of multiple recurrence and               
              nonconventional averages introduced by Furstenberg.  He will                   
              study pointwise and norm convergence of these non-conventional                 
              averages.  He will study the Wiener-Wintner versions of return                 
              times theorem which were used by Furstenberg in his proof of                   
              Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progressions.                                
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics" can              
              be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                          
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
