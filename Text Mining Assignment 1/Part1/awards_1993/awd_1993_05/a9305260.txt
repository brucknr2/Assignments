Abstract    :
              9305260  BASS, Jay D.       This is a program of measuring acoustic velocities
              and, hence,  elastic moduli of minerals and high-pressure silicates of 
              geophysical interest by Brillouin light scattering experiments.   The main
              thrust will be measurement of velocities and elastic  moduli at high pressures
              in diamond cells, and at high  temperatures.  The high P - T studies will
              emphasize minerals which  are important to the Earths mantle.  These
              experiments will yield  the pressure and temperature derivatives of elastic
              properties, and  will allow the properties of mineral assemblages to be
              calculated  for actual conditions within the Earth with much greater 
              confidence.
