Abstract    :
              9305745  Ramachandran       The proposal is concerned with geometric questions 
              pertaining to complex manifolds.  Specifically, the investigator  will study an
              interaction between invariants of the covering  group of a compact Kaehler
              manifold and function theory of the  covering.  This will lead to questions
              concerning the fundamental  group of quasiprojective varieties.  The techniques
              and expected  results may have applications to algebraic geometry and other 
              areas of mathematics.
