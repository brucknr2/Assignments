Abstract    :
                                   Abstract      P.I. Clark Larsen  SBR-9305391    It has
              become a truism that the Spanish Conquistadores had a devastating effect on the
              health of Native Americans throughout the New World, as documented in various
              locales by dramatic population declines.  However, the extensive findings to
              date from Spanish Florida (La Florida) indicate that, although the catastrophic
              effects of Old World pathogens on native populations were important and very
              common consequences of contact, these effects should be viewed as a single
              facet of a complex, multifaceted problem. Equally important for understanding
              the contact issue are questions relating to how native populations responded
              and adapted to great social, dietary, and behavioral changes in a number of
              settings over relatively long periods of time.  Besides the immediate declines
              in many areas due to epidemics, in many regions, generations of survivors
              continued to respond to new and novel challenges despite deteriorating
              circumstances.  It is essential to move away from single cause explanations of
              population change to reach a broad-based understanding of decline in health,
              diet, the social fabric of Native American groups after 1492.    This study
              will undertake detailed and extensive bioarchaeological analyses of remains
              from a large region of La Florida, and over a long time interval.  In
              particular, the impact of European arrival and the establishment of missions
              will be studied, along with how native populations accommodated new demands
              associated with changes in activity (eg. demands for labor) and died (eg. more
              reliance on maize as a dietary staple) .  ***  P:\anthro\jfried\9305391.abs
