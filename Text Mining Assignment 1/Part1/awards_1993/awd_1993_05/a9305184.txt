Abstract    :
              9305184  Brearley  The principal objective of this project is to study in 
              detail the mechanisms of  the high pressure mantle phase  transformations of
              Mg2SiO4 and (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 under a wider  range of PT conditions relevant to the
              model mantle geotherm  and subducting oceanic lithosphere.  The study will
              continue  our efforts to delineate the pressure-temperature regimes  over which
              different transformation mechanisms may operate  in the Earth's mantle and
              identify what factors may cause  changes in the transformation mechanism (P,T,
              degree of  overstepping etc.).  In particular we will concentrate on  the
              mechanisms of transformations involving the    polymorph  of  Mg2SiO4 and
              (Mg,Fe)2SiO4.  We will examine the role that  water may play in transformations
              involving    -phase and  examine in detail the nature of order-disorder 
              transformations in    -phase and how they may influence the  stability of    
              -phase in the mantle.  The results have  important geological implications for
              upper mantle dynamics,  especially the rheological behavior of subducting
              oceanic  slabs and the mechanisms of deep focus earthquakes.  The  project will
              involve high pressure kinetic experiments using  a multi anvil high pressure
              apparatus coupled with detailed  microstructural studies using optical and
              electron  microscopy.  Special emphasis will be placed on the use of 
              transmission electron microscope techniques, particularly  electron diffraction
              and high resolution electron microscopy  to elucidate the transformation
              mechanisms.
