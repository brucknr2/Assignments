Abstract    :
              In applications like image analysis, signal detection and  ecological spatial
              data smooth and non-smooth parts for curves  and surfaces occur simultaneously.
              In the higher dimensional  case, isolated discontinuities occurring in
              otherwise smooth  surfaces correspond to boundaries or "break curves". Methods
              for  analyzing break curves and to estimate smooth-non-smooth surfaces  and
              regression functions will be developed, using curve  estimation, least squares
              and (local) maximum likelihood  techniques.  Applications include confidence
              regions for break  curves and isoklines, edge detection in image analysis, the 
              Poisson forest problem, and dimension reduction techniques for  high
              dimensional regression.  Many phenomena in biological, environmental and
              economic sciences  can be described by the occurrence of sharp changes when
              either  time or location varies. Statistical tools will be developed for  the
              analysis of data describing such changes. These will be of  particular interest
              for the detection of edges in images and for  parsimonious descriptions of
              high-dimensional data.  In this  context, confidence regions will be
              constructed which allow for  instance to find "safe" areas where pollutant
              levels are below  critical levels. The proposed methods will work under minimal
               assumptions on the nature of the data.
