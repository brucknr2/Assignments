Abstract    :
                      9305165  Bedinger    Plant cell walls are dynamic structures that both
              determine  morphological structure and mediate cell-cell interactions in plant 
              development. Cell wall proteins are likely to participate actively  in both
              roles. The relatively simple structure of pollen and the  known pollen
              "recognition partners" for cell-cell interactions  (stigma and stylar canal)
              make pollen an ideal system for the study  of plant cell wall proteins and
              cell-cell recognition. Dr. Bedinger  has identified two novel classes of
              extracellular matrix proteins  specific to pollen. One class of proteins is
              tightly associated  with the outer pollen wall, or exine, and may be involved
              with  establishing the species specific pattern of exine ornamentation,  or in
              pollen-pistil recognition. The second class of protein(s) may  be structural
              components of the pollen tube wall, or may act as  sexual agglutinins to
              mediate the interaction of the pollen tube  with female tissues. Dr. Bedinger
              proposes to isolate full length  genes encoding these proteins, localize the
              proteins within the  pollen or pollen tube, and investigate the role of the
              proteins in  male-female recognition. The data obtained from the proposed 
              studies will enable us to propose testable models for the functions  of these
              proteins in plant reproduction.  ***
