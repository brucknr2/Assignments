Abstract    :
              9305425  Marzke   This award provides partial funding (57% of total cost) for
              the acquisition of components of a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer
              (NMR) system to be installed and operated in the Department of Physics at
              Arizona State University . The NMR unit will consist of a 300 MHz spectrometer
              equipped with a wide-bore superconducting magnet configured for nuclear
              magnetic relaxation and NMR spectroscopic studies in solids and liquids under
              extreme conditions of pressure and temperature.  ***
