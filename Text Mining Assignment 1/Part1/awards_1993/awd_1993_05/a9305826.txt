Abstract    :
                   The investigator will continue research on the arithmetic of              
              hyperbolic 3-manifolds begun under DMS-9108050.  His main                      
              emphasis is on the study of incompressible surfaces in hyperbolic              
              3-manifolds, representations of the fundamental groups of such                 
              3-manifolds, and the geometry and structure of closed geodesics                
              in hyperbolic 3-manifolds.                                                     
                   Since the space of everyday life is three dimensional,                    
              understanding the structure of objects of this dimension is                    
              likely to be especially relevant to the real world.  This world                
              is certainly locally Euclidean, but on a cosmological scale it                 
              may well be hyperbolic -- at issue is the behavior of light paths              
              of enormous length.  In any event the techniques invented to                   
              answer questions about hyperbolic manifolds have surprisingly                  
              many applications elswehere in mathematics and theoretical                     
              physics.
