Abstract    :
                   Misiurewicz will investigate the conjecture that the only                 
              primary cycles for disk homeomorphisms are those with entropy                  
              zero.  He will also look for pseudo-Anosov cycles of a given                   
              period with minimal entropy.  A third problem will be to                       
              investigate the pseudo-Anosov cycles of torus homeomorphisms                   
              isotopic to the identity and try to analyze their rotation set.                
                   Combinatorial dynamics is a part of the theory of dynamical               
              systems dealing mainly with existence of periodic orbits, or                   
              cycles, for various types of discrete dynamical systems.  By a                 
              type of a cycle one understands in the simplest case of interval               
              maps the way the map permutes its points.  Very often existence                
              of a cycle of a given type forces the existence of many other                  
              types of cycles for the same map.  This model situation admits                 
              numerous generalizations.
