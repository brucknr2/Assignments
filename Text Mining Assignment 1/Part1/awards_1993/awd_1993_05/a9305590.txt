Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Fried to work               
              in number theory, specifically, in the application of the                      
              monodromy method.  The monodromy method takes the following form.              
              A precise statement S about Diophantine equations translates to                
              this: Rational points on certain varieties produce a desired                   
              Galois theory situation "g".  By forgetting where the Galois                   
              theory arises, we get a group theory situation G.  The method                  
              applies the group theory to solve G.  It then eliminates                       
              geometric situations in the list of "g" that don't correspond to               
              what remains of G.  This leaves the harder problem of deciding if              
              what geometrically remains produces the arithmetic situation                   
              under investigation.                                                           
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions, such as the                
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
