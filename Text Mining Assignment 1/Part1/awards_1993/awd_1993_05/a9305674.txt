Abstract    :
                   A workshop will bring a small group of about ten continental              
              geologists and geodynamists together to discuss fundamentally new              
              avenues of interdisciplinary research.  It is now possible, with               
              a new generation of global computer models of mantle convection                
              coupled to plate tectonics, to synthesis paleogeography, sea-level             
              change, platform stratigraphy, and basin subsidence with global                
              dynamics.  A range of dynamical questions (centered around how                 
              plates are coupled to the mantle and how convection changes in                 
              time) and traditional geological questions (centered around the                
              causes of sea-level change and Phanerozoic stratigraphic                       
              architecture) may now be solvable.  The participants will consider             
              which interdisciplinary questions can now be addressed, the kinds              
              of data to be synthesized into data bases, and how the a                       
              forthcoming generation of supercomputer models could be interfaced             
              with the diverse data.
