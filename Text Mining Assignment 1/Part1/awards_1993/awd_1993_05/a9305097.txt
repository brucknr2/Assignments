Abstract    :
                   Foreland basins adjacent to long-lived orogenic belts                     
              evolved in response to sporadic or continued crustal                           
              deformation.  This evolution is recorded in the                                
              stratigraphic record and reflects the spatial and temporal                     
              variation in uplifts, the development of intrabasinal folds                    
              and faults, and basin subsidence.  This study will examine                     
              the Late Paleozoic foreland in Nevada by focusing on  a                        
              network of  long sections along the axis of the basin and                      
              the included unconformities, structures and distinctive                        
              stratal packages that record how the foreland responded to                     
              the long-lived tectonism.  Results should help delineate                       
              differences in style of orogenic processes along the                           
              foreland and through time and should provide the basis of                      
              developing a rigorous stratigraphic approach to the                            
              assessment of the tectonic histories for long-lived foreland                   
              basin systems.
