Abstract    :
              9305122  Hughes  This is a 12 month Career Advancement Award.  The award covers 
              equipment to provide an environment for studying high-speed  networking,
              including priority scheduling of multimedia traffic,  congestion control for
              ATM nodes, task scheduling in distributed  environments, and multicast
              communication and group management.   Partial support for research assistants
              is also provided.
