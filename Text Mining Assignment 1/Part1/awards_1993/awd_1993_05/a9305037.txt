Abstract    :
              9305037  Maliga  The proposed research is on the general area of
              nucleocytoplasmic  interactions:  The objective is to identify nuclear genes
              that  control the expression of single Arabidopsis thaliana plastid  genes. 
              Specific objectives of the research are: (i) Clone and  sequence the plastid
              rbcL and psbA regions from Arabidopsis.  (ii)  Test expression of reporter
              genes encoding B- glucuronidase and  luciferase under control of psbA
              regulatory sequences.  (iii)  Arabidopsis seed mutagenesis and screening of M2
              seedlings for  nuclear mutants with altered reporter gene (uidA, luc)
              expression.   (iv) Established complementation groups, determine map position
              of  mutations.  ***  Through the project, methods will be developed for the
              manipulation  of the Arabidopsis plastid genome so that plastid molecular
              biology  and genetics can also benefit from this model system.  %%%
