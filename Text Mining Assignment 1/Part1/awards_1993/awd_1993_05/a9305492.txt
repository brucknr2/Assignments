Abstract    :
              9305492  Nolan  With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and 
              Organometallic Chemistry Program provides support for  determining bond
              enthalpies of organometallic compounds by Dr.  Steven P. Nolan of the Chemistry
              Department, University of New  Orleans.  Metal-hydride, metal-alkyl,
              metal-arene, metal-diene,  metal-phosphine, and metal-metal bond energies of
              group 8  metals will be found using solution calorimetric methods.  Special
              emphasis will be placed on iron and ruthenium complexes  of interest in
              homogeneous catalysis.  For example,  tetracarbonyliron derivatives will be
              used in the determination  of olefin-iron bond strengths and
              cyclopentadienylruthenium  species will be used to investigate a series of
              diene-ruthenium  bonds.  Attempts will be made to determine bond strengths of 
              ruthenium with heterocyclic compounds which are relevant to 
              hydrodenitrogenation, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrosilation.  %%% 
              Thermodynamic data are fundamentally important for both  theoretical and
              applied research in organometallic chemistry  and catalysis, yet relatively
              little data are available on  Group 8 organometallic bond strengths.  Knowing
              the energetics  of steps in a catalytic reaction is valuable for the 
              development of new and more effective catalysts useful, for  example, in
              hydroformylation or alkene isomerization reactions  in the chemical industry.
