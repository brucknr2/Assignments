Abstract    :
              9305943  Johnston    A type of vortex generator here called VGJ (for vortex
              generator  jets) is to be investigated experimentally. Skewed jets injected 
              from a wall into the adjacent boundary layer flow are known to  generate
              streamwise vortices that can be used for boundary layer  and separation
              control. Their detailed mechanisms and range of  behavior are still poorly
              mapped out. This investigation is to  obtain detailed measurements of mean and
              turbulent velocities in  various cross-stream planes downstream if the
              injection ports. The  basic experimental tool is LDV, and the experiments are
              to be  conducted in a water flow facility. Flow visualizations will also  be
              obtained.    Such devices could be useful for the control of separation, but 
              unlike conventional solid body vortex generators they offer the  possibility of
              active control.  ***
