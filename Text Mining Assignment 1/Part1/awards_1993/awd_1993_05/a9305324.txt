Abstract    :
              9305324  DePaolo    This research comprises a field expedition to collect 
              samples of massive corals from uplifted terraces on Sumba, Nusa  Tenggara,
              Indonesia, and isotope analyses of those samples.  The  objective is to produce
              several 30-to-150 year proxy records of  seasonal climate variability in
              Indonesia for different time  intervals in the last 150,000 years.  The data
              will be used to  assess the influence of paleogeography caused by changes in
              sea  level on the intensity of seasonal climate variability, as well as  the
              frequency and intensity of El Nino events as they are  manifested in Southeast
              Asia.  The effects of the El Nino/Southern  Oscillation have important economic
              and social consequences on both  sides of the Pacific Ocean.  Data produced
              from this study will  help unravel specific mechanisms of how oceanographic
              change  affects regional and global climate change.  ***

              proposal seeks funds to conduct a field expedition to collect  samples of
              massive corals from uplifted terraces on Sumba, Nusa  Tenggara, Indonesia.  The
              objective is to produce several 30-to-150  year proxy records of seasonal
              climate variability in Indonesia for  different time intervals in the last
              150,000 years.  The data will  be used to assess the influence of
              paleogeography caused  by  changes in sea level on the intensity of seasonal
              climate  variability, as well as the frequency and intensity of El Nino  events
              as they are manifested in Southeast Asia.  Preliminary  analyses of hand
              samples collected during a reconnaissance trip to  Sumba last summer indicate
              that the proposed study is feasi ble;  massive corals on Sumba are well
              preserved, and would provide  reliable information on seasonal variability of
              salinity and sea  surface temperature.  The radiocarbon ages of samples from
              one of  the terraces on Sumba place the growth of the coral at a time when  sea
              level was 50 meters lower than it is today.  the data produced  from this study
              will help unravel the specific mechanisms of how  oceanographic change affects
              regional and global climate change  during time period with significantly
              different boundary  conditions.  ***
