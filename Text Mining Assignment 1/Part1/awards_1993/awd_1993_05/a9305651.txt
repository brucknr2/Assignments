Abstract    :
                   Propagation of electromagnetic pulses in thick optical                    
              media are investigated using numerical techniques.  The                        
              problem is to try to understand whether resonant radiation can                 
              propagate in an undistorted fashion over long distances.  The                  
              extra flexibility offered by two driving fields makes the                      
              problem interesting in optical fiber technology.
