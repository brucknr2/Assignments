Abstract    :
              9305820  Lomen  This Americas Program award will support a regional program 
              development workshop on the uses of technology in the undergraduate 
              mathematics curriculum.  The workshop, which is jointly organized by  Prof.
              David Lomen of the University of Arizona and Prof. Luis Manuel  Tovar of the
              Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN) in Mexico City, will  introduce
              participants to existing mathematical software, discuss ways in  which it can
              improve the teaching and learning of mathematics, and explore  new ways of
              using technology in the classroom.    Expected outcomes of this workshop are:
              bilingual educational materials on  the use of technology in mathematics
              instruction; development of an  Internet interest group and bulletin board
              facility to link participants and  future collaborators via existing networks
              in Mexico and in Latin America  with the U.S.; and future collaborations
              between leaders in software  development, mathematicians, and math educators of
              the hemisphere.   ***
