Abstract    :
              9305128  Zaborszky  The proposed research is in the area of dynamic theory
              underlying  the security analysis of large interconnected electric power 
              systems.  Among the expected contributions of the proposed  research are the
              resolution of certain modeling issues which  arise near singular, and a
              practical procedure for finding  homoclinic orbits.  Another objective is the
              development of a  useful theory to deal with the common problem of changes in 
              system dimension as various devices reach hard limits, or in the  case of
              structural changes.     ***
