              The aim of this research project is to further understand  the fundamental
              behavior of gravity retaining walls subject  to earthquake loading; in
              particular, the effect of coupled  sliding and tilting on a gravity earth
              retaining structure  (current design practice neglects rotational motion and
              its  effect on earth forces); the effect of obstructed motion  (that is, a
              retaining wall coming in contact with a fixed  object such as a bridge abutment
              and a bridge deck); and  the effect of repeated loading.  The focus is on
              gravity  retaining walls, as these can provide the basis for  understanding
              more complex earth retaining systems.    The specific objectives are to:    1.
              Complete the data reduction and analysis of a prior  centrifuge modeling study
              that focused on the tilting  behavior of gravity retaining walls;    2. Conduct
              a new study on gravity retaining walls with dry  sand backfill that is capable
              of coupled sliding and  tilting, obstructed motion, and repeated loading
              behavior.  This involves experiments on a scale-model retaining wall  mounted
              on a geotechnical centrifuge which is capable of  simulating earthquake strong
              motions.    These studies will be used to assess the utility of  currently
              proposed techniques for describing coupled sliding  and tilting, obstructed 
              motion and repeated loading  behavior of earth retaining structures.  ***
