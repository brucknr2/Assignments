Abstract    :
              9305348  Williams  This support will enable the California Academy of Sciences
              to curate and computerize a recently discovered collection of molluscs that
              includes specimens from the 1905-1906 Galapagos Expedition and other early
              1900s expeditions to the Indo-Pacific.  This collection has historical
              importance in studies of the changes in mollusc diversity and the causes of
              those changes.  Computerizing the collection will make the data more readily
              available to researchers and students and will greatly increase its use in
              biodiversity research and education.  %%%  A historic collection of molluscs
              was recently discovered at the California Academy of Sciences, one of the
              premier institutions that house and maintain research collections of organisms
              and make them available for research and education to professionals and
              students.  These molluscs were collection in the early 1900s during expeditions
              to the Galapagos Islands and the Indo-Pacific.  Studies of these molluscs can
              reveal historical trends in changes in biodiversity of these groups and the
              possible causes for those changes.  Computerization of this collection will
              make the collection and its data much more accessible to researchers and
              students nationwide.  ***           2 ~          \ @          ~            ?~
