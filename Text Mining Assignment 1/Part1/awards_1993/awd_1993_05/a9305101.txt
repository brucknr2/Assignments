Abstract    :
                   The nature of deformation hear the base of accretionary                   
              wedges likely involves extensive transport by fluids of                        
              silica and other components, brittle crack-seal veining and                    
              rock fabrics such as cleavage.  However, estimates of  the                     
              magnitude of fluid interactions and the scale over which                       
              they are operative is highly controversial.  This project                      
              will examine the distribution, orientation, geometry,                          
              texture and geochemistry of quartz veins in a well-exposed                     
              and well-understood forearc complex on Afognak Island,                         
              Alaska.  Coupled with measurements of volume change in wall                    
              rocks and oxygen isotopic analyses the plumbing system in                      
              rocks buried to depths of  8-12km will be reconstructed and                    
              used to infer the mechanisms of silica transport and the                       
              extent and nature of fluid flow near the base on an                            
              accretionary wedge.  Results will be relevant to the study                     
              of accretionary, wedge development and to the study of the                     
              origins of rock deformation fabrics.
