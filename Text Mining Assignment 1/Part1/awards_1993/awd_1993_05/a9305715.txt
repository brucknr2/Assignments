Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with classifying semisimple,                    
              braided tensor categories that are generated by a single object X              
              with a prescribed decomposition of the tensor square of X with                 
              itself.  The principal investigator will also work on the                      
              question of strictness of braided categories and their                         
              characterization in terms of balancing phases.                                 
                   A category is a collection of objects, together with a                    
              collection of maps and a rule of composition of maps.  One                     
              example is the set of functions on subsets of the real line using              
              the usual composition of functions.  Categories were originally                
              defined to fill a foundational role in mathematics.  However,                  
              current research in category theory is concerned with categories               
              with structure.  This area has potential impact on a number of                 
              different areas of mathematics, as well as theoretical physics.
