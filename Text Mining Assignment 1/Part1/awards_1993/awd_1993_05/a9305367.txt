Abstract    :
                   Large volume strain has been reported from several                        
              studies involving deformed thrust wedge packages, but little                   
              is known about the mechanism of mass transport.  This                          
              project will use stable isotope geochemistry and whole-rock                    
              composition data to assess the role of fluid flow and to                       
              determine the direction and quantity of flow.  Results                         
              should further quantify volume strain in the late Cretaceous                   
              San Juan-Cascade nappes of western Washington and provide                      
              insight into the direction and magnitude of fluid flow                         
              responsible.
