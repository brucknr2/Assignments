Abstract    :
                   Diamond-bearing rocks of the Dabie Shan metamorphic                       
              province of South China are                                                    
              among the most unique rocks exposed on the surface of the                      
              earth and present a major challege to tectonicists in terms                    
              of explaining their origins.  Mineralogy of these rocks                        
              indicate that they originated at the surface, were then                        
              subjected to enormous pressures by burial, and finally                         
              exhumed to the surface.  Although  much attention has been                     
              paid to the petrologic character of the affected rocks,                        
              little work has been concentrated on the structures that are                   
              ultimately responsible for their unique history.  This                         
              project is geared to conducting such  studies and will                         
              attempt to establishe the geometry and kinematics of the                       
              structures and will establish timing and cooling relations.
