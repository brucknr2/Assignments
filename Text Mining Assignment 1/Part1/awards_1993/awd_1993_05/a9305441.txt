Abstract    :
              9305441  Seebaugh       Measurements of aerosol made from aircraft sampling
              platforms  are essential to study the ozone depletion and climatic effects of 
              airborne particles.  Current aircraft aerosol inlets fail to  achieve samples
              which are representative of the aerosol in the  ambient atmosphere.  The
              difficulty arises from the degree of  slowing required between the free air
              stream and the entrance to  the sampling device or instrument.  Done
              incorrectly, this slowing  can lead to significant inertial enrichment of the
              aerosol or to  significant losses due to turbulent deposition within the inlet.
                      During the initial portion of this project diffusers with  useful area
              ratios will be built and turbulence will be controlled  with boundary layer
              suction.  Aerosol deposition studies will be  done to demonstrate that the
              reduced turbulence in the inlet is  accompanied by increases in particle
              transmission through the  diffuser.  In the second year, an aerodynamic pumping
              system to  provide the needed suction will be designed.  The basis for this 
              design will involve either contouring the leading edge of the inlet  to provide
              insensitivity to angle of attack or adding a shroud  around the diffuser.  Wind
              tunnel experiments will be used to  verify that the internal and external flows
              behave as expected.   The product will be an inlet that is ready for testing on
              aircraft.  ***
