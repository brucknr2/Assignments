Abstract    :
                   P.I. will study some free interface problems modeling                     
              combustion and phase transitions which generate complex dynamics               
              even in 1-D evolution. He will prove global in time existence of               
              classical solutions and stability for Hopf bifurcation. He will                
              obtain numerically a complete dynamical portrait including                     
              sequences of period doubling and transition to chaos, infinite                 
              period bifurcations, Silnikov type dynamics etc. Finite-D system               
              modeling entire variety of their dynamics will be derived and                  
              studied. P.I. will also study numerically and analytically                     
              dynamics  generated by a number of invariant surface evolution                 
              equations.  The equations model basic instabilities in flames and              
              demonstrate formation of nontrivial patterns such as cellular                  
              structures, self-turbulence, spiral waves etc.                                 
                   P.I. will study rigorously and numerically several problems               
              modeling propagation of flames, solidification fronts and laser                
              induced evaporation.  These processes are known to generate                    
              complex dynamical patterns, both temporal and spacial. P.I will                
              obtain numerically a complete dynamical portrait of a variety of               
              regular and chaotic pulsating regimes associated with plane                    
              evolution.   P.I. will also study numerically and analytically                 
              dynamics generated by a number of surface evolution equations.                 
              The equations model basic instabilities in flame propagation and               
              demonstrate formation of nontrivial patterns such as cellular                  
              structures, self-turbulence, spiral waves etc.
