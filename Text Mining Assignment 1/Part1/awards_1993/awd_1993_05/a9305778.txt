Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona will  purchase a Sun
              Microsystems SPARC center 2000 computer which will  be dedicated to the support
              of several research projects in both  applied and pure mathematical science. 
              Specific projects  include: (1) mesoscopic modeling of large-scale
              hydrodynamics;  (2) computational nonlinear optics; (3) numerical PDEs with 
              complex geometrical boundaries; (4) algebraic manipulation of  polynomial and
              topological invariants; and (5) computer-assisted  proofs for chaotic dynamics.
               These projects are major efforts  towards solving leading problems in
              Computational Fluid Dynamics,  Nonlinear Optics, and several fundamentals
              issues in pure  mathematical science.  They have common need for a more
              powerful  local computing facility.
