Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistical Science at Southern Methodist University will 
              purchase a departmental file server, a graphics workstation and related UNIX 
              equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
              mathematical  sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including  construction and analysis of phylogenies based on DNA
              sequence data, statistical  analysis of data related to global temperature
              variation, geometrical approaches  to ranked data, and bandwidth selection in
              nonparametric function estimation.
