Abstract    :
                   The investigator intends developing his recent                            
              generalization of the Duistermaat-Heckman formula which is an                  
              integral formula for the exponential of the square of the moment               
              map on symplectic manifolds.  The generalization is to the case                
              of non-abelian groups.  Using the method of stationary phase,                  
              applications of this formula to quantum field theory are                       
              envisaged.
