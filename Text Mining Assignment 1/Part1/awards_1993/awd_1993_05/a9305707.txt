Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at The Ohio State University intends  to purchase a
              high-resolution color workstation and imaging  system to be dedicated to the
              support of research in the  mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used
              in several new  and ongoing research projects, including in particular: 1) 
              Graphical Methods for High Dimensional Stochastic Dynamical  Systems by L. Mark
              Berliner 2) Dynamic Analysis of Hierarchical  Bayes Models by Mario Peruggia
              and Thomas Santer 3) Dynamic  Graphical Predictions in Multistate Survival
              Models by John Klein  4) Confidence Ellipsoids for Bioequivalence by Jason Hsu 
               All Four projects require the use of a high-resolution color  graphics system
              with the ability to make, display and record  animated sequences and still
              images.
