Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Rochester will purchase  some
              computer and software which will be dedicated to the support of research  in
              the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for the following  five
              research projects:  (1) Computational homotopy theory (Frederick R. Cohen  and
              Douglas C. Ravenel)  (2) Simulations of stochastic processes (Michael  Cranston
              and Carl E. Mueller)  (3) Evolution of curves and surfaces (Michael  E. Cage) 
              (4) Inverse problems for partial differential equations (Adrian I.  Nachman) 
              (5) Ramanujan graphs and number theory (Arnold K. Pizer)  The  Principal
              Investigators are Arnold K. Pizer and Douglas C. Ravenel.
