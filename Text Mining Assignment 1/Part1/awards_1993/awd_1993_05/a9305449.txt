Abstract    :
                   Developmental instability (DI) is the failure of an organism              
              to develop normally, in ways ranging from physical anomalies and               
              disease to abnormal behavior.  The causes of DI include genetic                
              and environmental factors and their interactions.  In man, DIs                 
              include cleft lip, congenital heart disease, schizophrenia and                 
              chromosomal abnormalities as well as exposure to teratogens such               
              as alcohol and isoretinoin.  However, despite extensive                        
              theoretical explanations, it is not known how developmental                    
              homeostasis breaks down to produce abnormal phenotypes.                        
                                                                                             
              This award supports a workshop titled "Developmental Instability:              
              Its Origins and Evolutionary Significance".  This conference will              
              discuss ways to measure developmental instability, genetic and                 
              developmental origins of instability, human health and phenotypic              
              variation, and DI's relevance to population biology and evolution              
              in general.  The coonference breaks new ground and has a strong                
              interdisciplinary approach, joining the fields of evolutionary                 
              and developmental biology.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
                   DI has far-reaching implications for population biology,                  
              environmental biology and human health.  DI is reported to                     
              increase in populations of organisms whose habitats are polluted               
              or otherwise altered, as well as in those experiencing                         
              bottlenecks and subsequent inbreeding.  Despite this lack of                   
              knowledge, DI is already employed as the basis for decisions                   
              regarding whether species are endangered or humans are at risk.
