Abstract    :
                   Understanding the growth and development of faults is                     
              one of the classic problems of geology,  rock mechanics, and                   
              engineering geology.  Existing theories are based mainly on                    
              short-term, lab bench size laboratory experiments that are                     
              then scaled to geologic time-scales and map scales.  This                      
              approach has been far from satisfying.  This projects seeks                    
              to continue theoretical and field studies directed at                          
              developing models that describe the growth and development                     
              of faults.  Creation of successful models will have                            
              tremendous implications in terms of allowing for the                           
              prediction of the location of fractured hydrocarbon                            
              reservoirs, the direction of propagation of fractures along                    
              loaded fault segments, and analyzing ancient fault motions.
