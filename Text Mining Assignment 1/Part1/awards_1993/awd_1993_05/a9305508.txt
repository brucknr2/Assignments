Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial support for the operation and                 
              maintenance of the ion microprobe facility in the Department of                
              Geology and Geophysics at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.            
              The facility is operated mainly to apply the ion microprobe                    
              technique toward the analysis of trace elements and isotopic                   
              compositions in geological samples. Access to the capabilities of              
              the instrument is provided by the Woods Hole ion microprobe                    
              laboratory for a national community of U.S. researchers in                     
              geochemistry.
