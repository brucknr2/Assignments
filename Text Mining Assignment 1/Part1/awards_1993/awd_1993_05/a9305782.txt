Abstract    :
              9305782  Yelon       This research explores high performance rare
              earth/iron-based  magnets.  Systematic changes in compositions are explored,
              band  structure calculations made, and neutron diffraction used to  determine
              atomic site preferences.  A comprehensive study of site  substitution in two
              types of magnetic structures are examined,  R2Fe17 and RFe12-xTMx, where R
              refers to the rare earth elements and  TM to the transition metals.  The
              materials are synthesized, with  first and second transition row elements along
              with Al, Si, Ga and  Ge with an aim of optimizing average bond lengths. 
              Properties are  characterized by bulk magnetic measurements and structure by
              X-ray  and neutron diffraction.  In selected cases band calculations are 
              carried out.   %%%       The ultimate goal is to determine new compositions for
              these  materials that display superior magnetic properties for use in a 
              variety of applications.  ***
