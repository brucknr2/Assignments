Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Southern Methodist University  will purchase a
              computation file server, X-windows stations, X-  window emulators, and software
              which will be dedicated to the  support of research in the mathematical
              sciences.  The equipment  will be used for several research projects including
              in  particular:  1) Numerical Models of Laser Arrays 2) Development  of ODE
              codes 3) Fast Solution to Large, Structured Discrete Ill-  Posed Problems 4)
              Foam Rheology
