Abstract    :
              9305389  Bujarski     The long term goal of this research is to understand the
              molecular  mechanism of RNA-RNA recombination in brome mosaic virus (BMV), a 
              single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. A unique heteroduplex  driven
              recombination system capable of directing a cross between  engineered 3'
              non-coding region of the mutant BMV RNA-3 and the  wild type virus has been
              developed in our laboratory. We will use  this recombination system to study
              the involvement of BMV replicase  proteins in recombination. Effects of
              mutations in 1a and 2a  proteins on the frequency and symmetry of crossovers
              and on the  incorporation of nontemplated nucleotides will be determined. These
               studies should allow us to map the recombinationally active  replicase
              sequences.  %%%  These experiments will provide novel insight into an
              understanding  of the basic nature of recombinational events in BMV and other
              RNA  viruses.  ***
