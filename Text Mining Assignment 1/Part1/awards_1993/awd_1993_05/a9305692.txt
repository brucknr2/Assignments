Abstract    :
              9305692  Berger       This award provides 60% of the cost of improving the 
              laboratory equipment in the thermoluminescence (TL) dating  laboratory in the
              Department of Geology at the Western Washington  University. The University is
              committed to providing the remaining  funds needed for the equipment upgrade.  
                  Thermal luminescence chronology uses the fact that mineral  grains act as
              dosimeters of natural radiation capable of storing  a portion of the energy
              from low-level environmental ionizing  radiation (alpha, beta, gamma rays)
              which they absorb while at or  near the surface. Because daylight empties
              light-sensitive electron  traps and heating empties all electron traps (i.e.,
              thermally  stable defect sites) the time of last exposure to daylight of 
              unheated samples or the last heating of volcanically heated  materials can be
              dated with TL methods. At earth surface  temperatures the storage of radiation
              energy can be accommodated  for up to about one million years, making the TL
              method especially  useful for timing events in the Quaternary period. The
              improved  capabilities of the Western Washington University lab will be used 
              in research projects which require dating of Quaternary samples.  ***
