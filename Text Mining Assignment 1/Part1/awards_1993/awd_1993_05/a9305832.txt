Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in three areas of commutative                
              algebra.  The first part of this work is directed at studying                  
              linkage.  The principal investigator will study a numerical                    
              condition on the graded resolution that might imply that an ideal              
              is licci.  He also will study the relation between several                     
              possible definitions for a local ring to be licci.  The second                 
              part of his work is concerned with symmetric algebras of modules               
              and Vasconcelos' Factorial Conjecture.  The third part of his                  
              work is aimed at understanding reduced and irreducible projective              
              curves in terms of their general hyperplane sections.                          
                   This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of              
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
