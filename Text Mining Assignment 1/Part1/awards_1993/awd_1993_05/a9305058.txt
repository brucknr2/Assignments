Abstract    :
              9305058  L'Hernault    Motile cells can move toward a target site, where they
              interact  with other cells found at this new location.  Sperm migration and 
              subsequent sperm-egg interactions in the nematode Caenorhabditis  elegans
              offers an attractive model system in which to study the  genetic control of
              these phenomena.  There are mutations in seven  known genes which result in
              motile spermatozoa that are incapable  of fertilization.  Mutations in three of
              these spermatogenesis-  defective genes are known to produce cytologically
              normal sperm  that are motile, but defective in sperm migration toward the
              normal  site of fertilization and in sperm-egg interactions at that site.  
              These genes will be subjected to detailed cell biological, genetic,  and
              molecular analyses.  Specifically, mutants will be analyzed by  electron
              microscopic and other cell biological techniques to reveal  any obvious
              alterations in either sperm structure or sperm  interactions with oocytes. 
              Additional alleles will be recovered  and the null phenotype will be defined
              for these three genes.   Alleles that will aid in the molecular cloning of
              these genes will  also be sought.  Cosmid transgenic rescue will be employed to
               localize one of these genes on the available C. elegans physical  map and
              permit its molecular cloning.  These studies should reveal  how sperm recognize
              their location in the reproductive tract, move  towards oocytes, and
              subsequently fertilize them.  ***
