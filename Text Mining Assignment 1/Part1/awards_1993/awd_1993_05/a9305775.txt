Abstract    :
                   The Department of Statistics at Penn State University will                
              purchase workstations for use in computationally intensive                     
              statistical research and in the Department's network, and several              
              items for work in color graphics.  The equipment will be used in               
              several research projects, including:                                          
                   (1)  Statistical Analysis and Visualization of Space                      
                   (2)  Posterior Simulation and Imputation in Large-
