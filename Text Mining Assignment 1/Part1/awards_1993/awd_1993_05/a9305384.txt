Abstract    :
              9305384  Lovera  This research project will continue theoretical  investigations
              of the multi-diffusion domain (MDD) behavior  of the K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar
              system.  The results will  ultimately find application in research that
              elucidates the  tectonothermal evolution of the lithosphere.  The goals of  the
              proposal are to investigate all fundamental assumptions  of the MDD model, to
              generalize the model to account for  episodic loss and heating/cooling, and to
              develop an  automatic inversion of the thermal history content of K- 
              feldspars.  Techniques to be utilized include laboratory  annealing experiments
              and numerical analysis.
