Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Rhizobium-legume symbiosis offers a model system for the                       
              examination of plant microbe interaction and plant developmental               
              regulation. Many bacterial polysaccharides have been shown to be               
              important factors in successful nodulation of the host plant,                  
              particularly LPS and EPS. This project is aimed at furthering an               
              understanding of the infection and nodulation process.  R. meliloti            
              Rm1021 EPS- mutants are unable to infect the normal host plant;                
              however strain AK631 (EPS-) produces a non-LPS, 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-             
              octulosonic acid (Kdo) containing polysaccharide that appears to               
              substitute for the EPS in the nodulation of alfalfa. The Kdo-rich              
              polysaccharide is novel to rhizobia and is analogous to a class of             
              K-antigens from E. coli. A form of this polysaccharide  has been               
              found in all R. meliloti strains examined to date. Preliminary data            
              indicate that the lpsZ gene and the fix-23 gene region are involved            
              in the synthesis and modification of this polysaccharide; mutation             
              of these genes result in strains that  are unable to nodulate the              
              host plant and are defective in the production of this                         
              polysaccharide.  In addition, the incorporation of the lpsZ gene               
              into R. meliloti Rm1021 EPS- mutants results in the modification of            
              the Kdo polysaccharide and the restoration of the Fix+ phenotype.              
              The objectives of this project are: 1) the structural                          
              characterization of the wild type polysaccharide from R. meliloti              
              AK631; 2) the characterization of the polysaccharides from fix-23              
              and lpsZ mutants of R. meliloti AK 631; 3) the purification of                 
              bacterial surface components for use in biological activity                    
              studies; and 4) the determination of the biochemical effect of lpsZ            
              in Rm 1021. Biological nitrogen fixation offers a cost effective               
              and environmentally sound alternative to chemical fertilizer, where            
              applicable. This research constitutes a significant contribution to            
              the broad base of scientific knowledge required for advancements in            
              the areas of plant-microbe interaction, plant developmental                    
              regulation, and biological nitrogen fixation in agriculture.
