Abstract    :
              The principal objective of this research project is to                         
              construct a metamorphic fluid flow budget for a portion of                     
              the Grenville Province of southern Ontario.  The results of                    
              the study will provide information on metamorphic rock                         
              permeabilities and on the potential for heat and mass                          
              transport by metamorphic fluids, and thus will ultimately                      
              find application in constraining models for fluid flow in                      
              mid-crustal settings.  The study will be based upon field                      
              mapping and results obtained from mineral thermometric                         
              calculations and stable isotope analysis.  Aspects of                          
              interest include metamorphic temperatures and thermal                          
              gradients, metamorphic fluid compositions, the nature of                       
              fluid fluxes and flow paths, and the mechanisms of fluid-                      
              rock interactions.
