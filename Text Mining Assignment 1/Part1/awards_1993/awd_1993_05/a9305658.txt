Abstract    :
                   Research will be performed in three areas: (i) stability,                 
              finite time blow-up, decay rates, and asymptotics of life span of              
              solutions to reaction-diffusion equations in the whole space;                  
              (ii) locations and rates of blow-up of solutions to spatially                  
              non-uniform nonlinear heat equations (model equations including                
              the ones arising in the channel flow problem); (iii)                           
              concentration phenomena of solutions of semilinear elliptic                    
              equations (including Schrodinger equations and the equations                   
              arising in chemotaxis and binary mixture problems in biology and               
              physics).                                                                      
                   The problems proposed are of mathematical, physical and                   
              biological importance.  Some of the equations in the project have              
              been well-known to mathematicians for years, yet new and                       
              challenging questions about these equations remain unanswered.                 
              The solutions for these problems will not only deepen our                      
              understanding of these concrete models, but also have impact on                
              the understanding of and resolution to other related problems in               
              the fields of mathematics, physics and biology.
