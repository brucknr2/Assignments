Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              American scientists and students will participate in an                        
              international conference on brain development entitled 'Specificity            
              in Neural Development.'  Normal function of the nervous system                 
              depends on a precise pattern of connections between nerve cells.               
              In the adult brain, this pattern of connections is very complex,               
              with some nerve cells communicating with other nerve cells over a              
              meter away.  The mechanisms by which this complex pattern of                   
              connections develops are unknown, but considerable insight into                
              these mechanisms has been gained through recent investigations.                
              This conference will bring together many of the world's scientists             
              working on this problem.  These scientists will share their                    
              knowledge and through discussion chart the future directions of the            
              field.
