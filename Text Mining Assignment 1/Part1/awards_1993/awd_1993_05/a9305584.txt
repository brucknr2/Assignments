Abstract    :
              9305584  Bradshaw       Darwinian fitness is achieved through high survival,
              fast  development, and prolific reproduction.  Ideally, an organism  would
              produce a large number of offspring, each with a high  probability of
              surviving, on the day it is born.  Clearly,  organisms do not achieve this
              ideal; rather, the life cycle of  organisms is a compromise between fast, safe
              development of  reproductive age and number and quality of offspring produced. 
               The pitcher-plant mosquito appears to circumvent this compromise:  fast
              developing mosquitoes are prone neither to early death nor  to reduced
              fecundity.  Dr. Bradshaw's plans to determine whether  evolution of a mosquito
              that is capable of faster, safer  development and higher fecundity could occur.
               Mosquitoes that  achieved high Darwinian fitness under good conditions may be
              less  able to survive and reproduce under stressful conditions than are  normal
              mosquitoes.  If this proposition proves to be true, then  fitness in the real
              world represents a compromise between  maximizing gain in fitness under ideal
              conditions and minimizing  loss to fitness under adverse conditions.  %%%      
              Studies such as these may indicate which portions of  mosquito life cycles are
              adaptively rigid in response to adverse  conditions, allowing more effective
              targeting of sensitive  developmental stages to biological or chemical control.
