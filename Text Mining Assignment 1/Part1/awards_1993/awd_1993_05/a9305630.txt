Abstract    :
              9305630  Kimia  This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The 
              research addresses the problem of shape description to support the  recognition
              of objects from their two-dimensional profiles.  Classically,  object
              recognition is plagued with problems due to  variations of the projected
              objects from the ideal model due to  partial occlusion, movement of object
              parts, degradation due to  noise, changes in viewpoint and viewing direction,
              shadows, and  other effects.  This project addresses these problems with a 
              general purpose representation for shape which embeds these  variations in the
              form of deformations and is derived from first  principles.  An object
              recognition system will be implemented based  on this framework. The
              theoretical effort is focused on extending  the framework to the analysis and
              representation of surfaces in  three-dimensions.  The final result should
              support object  recognition for the complex problems that arise in industrial 
              applications in addition to those that arise in more general  machine vision.
