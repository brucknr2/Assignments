Abstract    :
              9305852  Gehring       This project is concerned with mathematical research on 
              geometric problems associated with classical complex analysis and  its more
              modern derivatives of quasiconformal mapping and Mobius  groups in two and
              higher dimensions.  The work on groups focuses  on questions related to the
              geometry of discrete two generator  groups with an elliptic generator.  It is
              possible to study the  groups through triples of complex numbers derived from
              the traces   of the generators.  But not all triples come from two-generator 
              groups and efforts to determine description of the sets  which determine
              discrete groups or the sets arising from  elliptic generators of order greater
              than three will be  undertaken.  Applications of this work are made to the
              study of  three- dimensional complete hyperbolic orbifolds.  In  particular
              substantial improvements in known lower bounds for the  volume of these
              orbifolds has been found.  The primary goal of  this project is to show that
              the volume of every hyperbolic  orbifold is the same as those for which the
              corresponding group  contains an elliptic element of order greater than three. 
              This  value is approximately .03905... Work in quasiconformal mapping 
              continues on the basic issue of determining when a domain in  dimension greater
              than two is quaiconformally equivalent to the  unit ball of the same dimension.
               Sufficient conditions are known  through Schoenflies type theorems.  If
              necessary conditions are  found, they will probably have to be formulated in
              certain types  of k- connectivity of the domains.  Finally, students supported 
              by this award will consider how classical function theory  relations discovered
              by Hardy and Littlewood carry over to  bounded quasidisks.        Studies in
              geometric function theory focus on how domains  are mapped into one another by
              smooth functions on which  various distortion restrictions are placed. 
              Questions of which  domains can be transformed into one another arise naturally
              and  this point of view automati cally leads to group theoretic  questions of
              fundamental consequence.  ***
