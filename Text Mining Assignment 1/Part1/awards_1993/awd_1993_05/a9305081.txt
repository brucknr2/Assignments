Abstract    :
                This research continues work aimed at understanding the low-                 
              frequency radiation from large earthquakes in the frequency band               
              from 1 to 15 millihertz, a frequency range previously unrecorded               
              by high-gain seismographs.  Preliminary analysis of 30 large                   
              earthquakes has shown that most earthquakes are ordinary in the                
              sense that their low-frequency source spectra are consistent with              
              the moment, origin time, centroid time, and duration estimated from            
              higher-frequency data and standard scaling relations.  Some                    
              earthquakes, however appear to be compound sources; that is, in                
              addition to a fast, "jerky" rupture with a characteristic duration             
              of tens of seconds, they comprise an episode of slow, smooth                   
              deformation with a duration of hundreds of seconds or longer.  In              
              addition, for some of these events, the slow component must involve            
              substantial moment release prior to the beginning of the fast                  
              component.  The assertion that slow precursors exist for some large            
              earthquakes has significant implications for models of earthquake              
              nucleation and strategies for short-term earthquake prediction.                
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
