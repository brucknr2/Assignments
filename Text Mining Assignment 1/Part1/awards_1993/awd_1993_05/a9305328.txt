Abstract    :
              9305328  Jordan     This research is a continuation of a collaborative effort of
              four  universities to use the PASSCAL portable broad-band seismometer  array
              facility for a comprehensive imaging study of the lateral  transitions in
              mantle structure beneath the Rocky Mountain Front.   Field work was completed
              under the first grant and this will  complete the analysis and synthesis of the
              data.  The Front Range  of the Colorado Rockies marks the eastern boundary of
              heavily  tectonized western North America and the western physiographic 
              boundary of the stable continental interior.  Earlier studies show  that there
              is a major lateral transition in seismic velocities  across the Front Range
              transition, but its details are poorly  understood.  Understanding this
              transition will provide constraints  on models of western U.S. dynamics and
              evolutionary models of the  North American craton.    ***
