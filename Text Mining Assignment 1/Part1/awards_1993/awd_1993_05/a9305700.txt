Abstract    :
                   The Department of Statistics at William Marsh Rice                        
              University will purchase a multi-processor computational server                
              which will be dedicated to the support of research in the                      
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several                 
              research projects, including in particular:  (1) Statistical                   
              Methods for Tuning Complex Computer Codes to Data; (2) Estimation              
              for Stochastic Processes by Simulation; (3) Computer Modeling of               
              Amplified Genes and Other Repetitive DNA Sequences; (4) Problems               
              in Multivariate Testing and Estimation; and (5) Problems in                    
              Adaptive Estimation, Cross-Validation, and Mode Testing.
