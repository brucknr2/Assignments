Abstract    :
                   The occurrence of large dominantly felsic plutons not                     
              obviously associated with a distinct tectonic event or                         
              "orogeny", particularly in deeply eroded Precambrian                           
              terranes, has long been problematic in the plate tectonic                      
              puradym.  This project will examine widespread plutonism in                    
              the Southwest at 1.4Ga to evaluate the kinematic and                           
              metamorphic history of these intrusion.  The work will focus                   
              of selected 1.5Ga plutons in Arizona and Colorado .  These                     
              data will supplement ongoing studies in New Mexico and                         
              provide a regional database from which to evaluate the                         
              nature of the 1.4Ga tectonism, and particularly test the                       
              current competing tectonic models of 1, anorogeny-a                            
              stationary Laurentian supercontinent insulated its mantle                      
              and induced mantle upwelling,  underplating and resulting                      
              granitoid plutonism, 2. extensional tectonism or 3.                            
              contractional tectonism.  Each model predicts different                        
              regional-scale kinematics, timing and thermal histories                        
              thereby providing the basis for a test of the hypotheses.                      
              The results are expected to resolve the tectonic setting of                    
              these plutons and to shed light on the origin of the                           
              anomalous "anorogenic" tracts in general.
