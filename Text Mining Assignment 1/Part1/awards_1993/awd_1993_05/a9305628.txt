Abstract    :
              9305628  Newman    The proposed research represents a collaborative project
              entitled  "Physical Mechanisms of Morphogenesis".  Tissue morphogenesis is  the
              process by which the form of the body and its various organs is  established in
              the embryo, and by which normal and abnormal changes  in the adult, such as
              wound healing and tumor invasion, are brought  about.  The two PIs on this
              collaborative project, Stuart Newman  (New York Medical College) and Gabor
              Forgacs (Clarkson University)  propose to continue a program of
              interdisciplinary studies on the  idea that 'generic' physical properties of
              tissue, such as surface  tension, interfacial tension, and viscosity contribute
              importantly  to the tissue's morphogenetic behaviors.  Model mesenchymal tissue
               containing suspended cells, or  cell-sized latex particles with  specific
              surface coatings, will be analyzed with respect to the  dependence of their
              surface and interfacial tension and viscosity  on the composition and
              macromolecular concentration of the matrix,  as well as the number per volume
              and surface characteristics of the  suspended cells or particles. 
              Interfacially-driven cell transport  in model matrices ('matrix-driven
              translocation') will be used as  a tool to study the dependence of
              morphogenetic properties on  physical and compositional variables.  The ability
              of living  mesenchymal tissue derived from avian embryos to mix, or to form 
              boundaries of immiscibility, will be correlated with the presence  of networks
              of extracellular fibers and the experimental disruption  of such networks.  A
              theoretical framework will be developed for  interpreting the relationship
              among physical, compositional, and  microscopic morphology of model tissues,
              and their capacity to form  interfaces, to flow, and to exhibit other
              morphogenetic changes.  ***
