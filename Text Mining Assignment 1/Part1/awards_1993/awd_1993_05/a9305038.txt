Abstract    :
              9305038  Welch       This project is an investigation of decoding procedures for
               cyclic codes and algebraic geometry (AG) codes with the following  objectives:
                    1. To obtain efficient and fast decoding procedures for the  decoding of
              cyclic codes up to the best known lower bound of the  minimum distance and to
              achieve the decoding of binary cyclic codes  of considerable lengths (for
              example codes of lengths less than  255) up to the actual minimum distance.    
                 2. To achieve the decoding of AG codes up to the designed  minimum distance
              with complexities to rival those of BCH codes and  Reed Solomon codes        G.
              L. Feng will be a post-doctoral researcher on the project.  The investigators
              have shown a universal method of determining the  minimum lower distance
              bounds. The have investigated the  possibility of decoding linear codes of
              considerable length up to  the bound obtained and  decoding binary cyclic codes
              up to their  actual minimum distance using a generalized majority scheme. They 
              have discussed the modified  Gauss elimination for Hankel matrix  and
              block-Hankel matrix which may result in lower complexity  in the decoding of AG
              codes.  These algorithms will be investigated  in order to reduce the
              complexities.  ***
