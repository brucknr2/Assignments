              x             9305925 Lipscomb          During the past two decades many
              ultrastructural; descriptions of ciliate genera provided new information that
              inspired reviews and revisions of ciliate systematics.  However, there have
              been only a few publications on the ultrastructural morphology of ciliates in
              the order Prostomatida, and no work at all on the suborder Prostomatina. 
              Because these ciliates have been proposed to be among the most primitive
              ciliates, a thorough morphological and taxonomic analysis of them is necessary
              before a stable classification of the phylum Ciliophora can be achieved.  The
              primary objective of this proposal is to extend the taxonomic scope of the PI's
              previous studies on the ciliates to include the prostomate family Metacystidae
              Kahl 1926 by focussing on an ultrastructural description of all the genera in
              the family, a description of the morphogenesis of a species of the genus   
              Metacystis   , and a cladistic phylogenetic analysis of the family's
              relationship to other prostomial ciliates.  The cladistic analysis will allow
              testing of hypotheses about the supposedly primitive evolutionary position of
              prostomate ciliates.  The broader significance of the proposed investigation is
              that understanding the diversity and phylogeny of ciliate groups will provide
              insight into basic evolutionary principles acting on both the single eukaryotic
              cell and on microbial organisms.  In analyzing the complex ultrastructural
              features o f these ciliates, problems and limitations of various methods for
              ordering multistate characters will be explored.  Details of this
              methodological exploration should be of broad value to systematists working
              with different groups of organisms and confronting problems with multistate
              character ordering. %%%          Ciliate protozoa play an important role in
              temporate costal wetlands as predators on bacteria, algae, other protozoa and
              small invertabrates in the decomposer food chain.  But the relationships of
              most of these ciliates are poorly understood.  This project will utilize
              detailed ultrastructural analysis to address questions of relationships of the
              family Metacystidae, a group considered to be very basal and therefore critical
              in understanding relationships of these important protozoa.
