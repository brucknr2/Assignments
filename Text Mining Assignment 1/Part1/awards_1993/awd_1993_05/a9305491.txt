Abstract    :
              The focus of this research involves a systematic                               
              reinvestigation of the mechanism of the Pauson-Khand reaction                  
              which will give a better understanding this important process.                 
              Second, the Pauson-Khand reaction will be used as a key step in                
              the synthesis of the natural product asteriscanolide and,                      
              third, Professor Krafft will probe electrophilic addition to                   
              unactivated alkenes.

              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Marie E. Krafft of the                          
              Department of Chemistry at Florida State University.  Professor                
              Krafft will focus her work on the chemistry of cobalt-alkyne                   
              complexes.  Both mechanistic studies and synthetic applications                
              of the the Pauson-Khand reaction will be carried out in order                  
              to develop new strategies for the construction of carbon-carbon                
              bonds.
