Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan               
              will purchase Unix workstation upgrade equipment which will be                 
              dedicated to support research in the mathematical sciences.  The               
              equipment will be used for several research projects, including                
              in particular:  Markov Chains Twisted by a Parameter and other
