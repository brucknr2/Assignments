Abstract    :
              9305453  Southworth    In flowering plants, the process of fertilization
              underlies  production of seeds and fruits.  Although the structural events of 
              double fertilization have been described, little is known about the   molecular
              mechanisms of fertilization.  Plant sperm are embedded in  pollen grains and
              move down the growing pollen tubes.  Near the  egg, the pollen tube releases
              two sperm: one fuses with the egg to  form the embryo, the other fuses with the
              central cell adjacent to  the egg to form the endosperm that supports growth of
              the   developing embryo.  A major unanswered question in plant  reproduction is
              how the sperm recognizes the egg or central cell,  adheres to it, and fuses
              with it.  Recognition molecules may be in  or on gamete membranes.  Monoclonal
              antibodies to sperm cell  surfaces are the first step in identifying unique
              sperm molecules.   The goals of this project are (1) to identify unique sperm
              membrane  molecules by screening monoclonal antibodies to isolated plant  sperm
              cells and (2) to involve undergraduates in a pioneering  research project.  The
              antibodies will be obtained from fusions of  splenocyte of mice immunized with
              sperm cells from Brassica.  The  results will further our knowledge of basic
              developmental  mechanisms that function in plant reproduction and will lead to
              a  basic understanding of fertility and sterility in plants.  Such  information
              can be used to produce hybrids from incompatible  species and inhibit
              fertilization where male sterility is required  to prevent self-crossing. 
              Undergraduate students will gain  valuable insight into active research by
              solving problems and  assisting in attainment of goals.  The research
              experience will  facilitate their development as scientists.  ***
