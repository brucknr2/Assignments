Abstract    :
                   The Pacific-North America plate boundary evolved from a                   
              continent-ocean convergent margin to a transform-dominated                     
              rift margin to a transform-dominated rift margin with the                      
              passing of the Rivera triple junction in late Miocene time.                    
              Baja California, Mexico is one of  the areas where the                         
              differing roles of extension and strike slip faulting can be                   
              documented throughout the evolution of a successful                            
              continental rift.  This project includes mapping, structural                   
              studies, stratigraphic and geochemical studies and Ar/Ar                       
              geochronology of Miocene and younger rocks in the southern                     
              Sierra Juarez, Baja California.  Results will provide                          
              insights into the role of continental extension during the                     
              transfer of continental crust to an oceanic plate during the                   
              transition from a convergent to transform-dominated rift                       
              plate boundary.
