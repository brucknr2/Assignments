Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and the Center for Applied  Mathematics and
              Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of  Technology will purchase color
              monitors, tape drive, disk,  compiler and statistical packages:  S-Plus, IMSL
              Fortran and  SYSTAT which will be dedicated to support faculty and students 
              research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be  used in support
              of several projects, including in particular:  .Evaluation of Multitype Repair
              Strategies by M.C. Bhattacharjee.  . A Minimum Distance Estimation Procedure
              and Bivariate Geometric  Models by Sunil K. Dhar.  . Biomedical Studies in
              Cardiology, Gynecology/Oncology, and  Neurology by R. Dios.  . Multivariate
