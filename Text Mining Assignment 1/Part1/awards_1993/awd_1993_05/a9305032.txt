Abstract    :
              Funding is requested to conduct synthetic fluid inclusion                      
              studies of geochemical processes applicable to ore-forming                     
              environments.  Synthetic fluid inclusions will be used to                      
              determine PVTX properties of fluids in the H2O-NaCl-KCl                        
              system to 10 kbars and 1000oC.  The product of this study                      
              will be a computer program and graphics describing the PVTX                    
              properties of H2O-NaCl-KCl that can be used to interpret                       
              micro thermometric data obtained from natural inclusions.  A                   
              second study will investigate the implications of hydrogen                     
              gain/loss by natural fluid inclusions.  Synthetic fluid                        
              inclusions will be made at known fO2 conditions and then re-                   
              equilibrated at known but variable fO2  conditions in order                    
              to quantify the rate of hydrogen fucacity change as a                          
              function of temperature, fugacity gradient and depth below                     
              the mineral surface.  This information will then be used to                    
              plan experiments to determine the effect of hydrogen                           
              gain/loss on (1) speciation of inclusion fluids and possible                   
              post-trapping changes, (2) the Hydrogen (D/H) isotopic                         
              composition of inclusion waters and (3) the solubility of                      
              various  daughter minerals that are commonly observed in                       
              natural fluid inclusions.  These data may then be used to                      
              estimate post-entrapment histories (uplift paths)                              
              experienced by natural fluid inclusions.
