Abstract    :
                   A collection of problems in stochastic adaptive control will              
              be investigated in this project. Stochastic adaptive control is                
              the optimal ergodic control of an unknown system and includes                  
              identification and control. For finite dimensional, continuous                 
              time, unknown linear stochastic systems the research will improve              
              existing results for completely observed systems and result in a               
              better conceptual understanding of partially observed systems.                 
              For unknown stochastic linear distributed parameter systems the                
              initial work on adaptive control of systems described by analytic              
              semigroups with boundary or point control will be expanded to                  
              stochastic hyperbolic systems. For unknown, finite dimensional                 
              nonlinear stochastic systems the results for almost self-                      
              optimality and self-optimality will be improved. The adaptive                  
              control of unknown stochastic distributed parameter systems will               
              be initiated for families of semilinear equations with                         
              cylindrical noise.                                                             
                   Most physical systems require the intervention of control                 
              mechanisms for their optimal performance. Typically the system is              
              not completely known and often contains random and unknown                     
              perturbations. The control of an unknown system subject to                     
              unknown random perturbations is called stochastic adaptive                     
              control. Most controlled systems require stochastic adaptive                   
              control in order to meet system performance criteria. This                     
              project will investigate problems in stochastic adaptive control               
              that are motivated by potential applications to physical systems.              
              It is anticipated that significant improvements in the conceptual              
              understanding of adaptive stochastic control processes and their               
              applications will be obtained .
