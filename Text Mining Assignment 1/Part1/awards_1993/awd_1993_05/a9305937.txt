Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, is concerned with the surface chemistry of                  
              small alkyl radicals on well characterized surfaces.  Professor                
              Stair has developed a novel radical source which is used to                    
              produce and deposit alkyl radicals on well characterized solid                 
              surfaces of molybdenum and iron.  The oxidative and radical                    
              coupling chemistry of the adsorbed species will be explored                    
              using a variety of ultra-high vacuum spectroscopic probes.                     
              Studies of the detailed dynamics of radical adsorption will                    
              also be carried out.

              One approach to the understanding of the complex surface                       
              chemistry of hydrocarbon catalysis is to investigate the                       
              detailed surface chemistry of possible reaction intermediates.                 
              This research project uses this approach by preparing radical                  
              alkyl intermediates and depositing them on a well characterized                
              surface.  The chemistry of these intermediates is then                         
              examined, providing a detailed understanding of the mechanism                  
              of hydrocarbon catalysis.
