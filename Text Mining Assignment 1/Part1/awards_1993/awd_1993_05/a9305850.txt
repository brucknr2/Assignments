Abstract    :
              9305850  Gidaspow    It is proposed to calibrate and extend the area of
              application of  a numerical approach for three-dimensional, transient,
              fluidized  bed simulation.  Comparisons to experimental results in bubbly, 
              gas-solid circulating, and three-phase fluidized beds will be  performed. 
              Validation tests for grid generation, constitutive  relationships and limit
              flow patterns are planned.  Reference  experiments will performed in
              collaboration with another group at  IIT to determine phase distributions and
              velocities by using a  gamma-ray densitometer, a X-ray densitometer, and
              radioactive  particle tracking.  It is expected that more reliable, accurate, 
              simulations for both gas-solid and three-phase fluidized systems  will be
              available at the end of the project.  Close collaborations  with industry and
              national laboratories are also planned.    The proposed computational approach
              will permit better design and  scale-up of gas-solid and gas-solid-liquid
              fluidized beds used in  chemical manufacturing, oil industry, and
              biotechnology.
