Abstract    :
                This research is to analyze seismic data collected during and                
              after the eruption of Pinatubo Volcano, Luzon, Philippines.  This              
              cataclysmic 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo was among the largest                
              volcanic eruptions of the century, with profound effects on the                
              people, landscape, and economic infrastructure of the Philippines              
              and the climate of the world.  The eruption was also one of the                
              best recorded natural disasters in history, providing a rich and               
              voluminous collection of seismological data that can be used both              
              for understanding the dynamics of an explosive volcanic system and             
              as a basis for predicting future volcanic eruptions.  The primary              
              objectives are to study the pre- and post-eruptive seismicity                  
              patterns, including the ongoing 1992-93 volcanic crisis; to study              
              the wave-form characteristics of seismic events; to relate these               
              studies to volcanic processes including the 1991 phreatic and                  
              paroxsysmal eruptions, the 1992 dome-forming event, secondary                  
              explosions on the pyroclastic flows, lahars, and steam jetting.                
              The research involves close collaboration between scientists at                
              Indiana University, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and                
              Seismology, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other groups involved              
              in volcanological research at Mt. Pinatubo.  This research is a                
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
