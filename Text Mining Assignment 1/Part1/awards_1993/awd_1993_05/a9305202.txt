Abstract    :
              9305202     Atkins  The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop 
              strategies and methods for the production of patterned arrays of  proteins in
              one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices.  Specific   aims include: (1) To
              determine the molecular mechanisms of metal  ion-induced assembly of "protein
              tubes" from bacterial gluatmine  synthetase (GS) dodecamers.  (2) To manipulate
              the exterior  "stacking" surface of GS and construct mutant proteins that 
              preferentially "stack" with other mutants rather than with  identical
              dodecamers.  (3) To alter the metal ion specificity of  the "stacking"
              reaction.  (4) To determine which subunit interfaces  are disrupted and
              reformed during the pressure-induced dissociation  and reassociation of GS and
              pyruvate dehydrogenase.  %%%  Development of patterned structures on a
              nanometer size-scale is  widely believed to hold promise for new developments
              in materials  research and manufacturing (nanofabrication).  One approach to 
              creating such structures involves utilization and modification of  naturally
              occurring processes, such as protein self-association.   By introducing
              modifications into the surface charge and structure  of several target
              proteins, the investigator intends to determine  the "rules of the game" which
              specify the types of two and three  dimensional aggregates which form.  ***
