Abstract    :
              9305856  Trench       A square matrix is said to  be persymmetric if reversing
              the  orders  of its rows and  columns produces the  transpose of the   matrix. 
              Toeplitz matrices, in which the elements along each  stripe parallel to the 
              main diagonal are  constant, are  the  most  important persymmetric matrices. 
              Reversing the order  of  the elements  of an eigenvector  of a Hermitian
              Toeplitz matrix   produces the  conjugate of  the eigenvector.   A  real
              symmetric  matrix of  order 2n (2n+1)  has n (n+1)  linearly independent 
              eigenvectors such that reversing the order of their elements  leaves the
              eigenvectors unchanged,  and n  linearly independent   eigenvectors such that
              reversing the order of  the elements is  equivalent to  multiplying the
              eigenvector by -1.   The sets of  eigenvalues associated  with these two kinds
              of eigenvectors  are  called the even  and odd spectra of the matrix, 
              respectively.     The   polynomials  having  the  elements of eigenvectors as  
              coefficients are  called the  eigenpolynomials of the matrix.   The
              investigator studies the interlacement properties  of  the   even  and  odd 
              spectra of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices,  the   location  of  the  zeros 
              of  the  eigenpolynomials of Hermitian   Toeplitz  matrices,   numerical 
              solution  of   the  inverse  eigenvalue problem for real symmetric Toeplitz
              matrices, and   analogous problems  for  more  general  Hermitian  persymmetric
               matrices and real symmetric persymmetric matrices.       Structured  matrices 
              of  the  kind  considered  here  have    important applications  in  statistics
               and  signal  processing.    The  matrices occurring in these applications are
              usually very  large.  This research attempts to exploit the peculiar  structure
               of these matrices in  order to solve problems in these areas  efficiently. 
              The main applications of the results will be  in  the area of  signal
              processing, the science  of extracting  information  from transmitted signals.
