Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the investigation of the chemical                
              and biochemical basis for methylation of bacteriochlorophyll-c                 
              and -d pigments which enables the pigments to adapt to low                     
              light conditions. The biosynthesis of the two pigments will                    
              also be explored to determine the branch point from                            
              chlorophyll-a biosynthesis.  A chemical synthesis of                           
              chlorophyll-a and its 4-vinyl analog, the conversion of the                    
              former into the latter, and a biomimetic ring-cleavage of                      
              chlorophyll derivatives to enable the synthesis of                             
              photochemically active bilins will be carried out.  Chiral                     
              chlorophyll derivatives will facilitate synthesis of chiral                    
              N-alkylporphyrin ferrochelatase inhibitors and the synthesis of                
              a number of porphyrin derivatives will be attempted.

              With this Accomplishment Based Renewal award, the Synthetic                    
              Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kevin M.                     
              Smith of the Department of Chemistry at the University of                      
              California, Davis.  Professor Smith will focus his work on a                   
              broad-based study of synthesis, biosynthesis, chemistry and                    
              spectroscopy of chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls.                         
              Chlorophylls are the catalysts in the vital process of                         
              photosynthesis, and are involved in light gathering and the                    
              process of charge separation.
