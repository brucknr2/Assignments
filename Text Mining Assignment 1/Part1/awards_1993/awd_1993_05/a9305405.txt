Abstract    :
              9305405  Clarke  Precise three-dimensional structures allow proteins to carry
              out  their architectural, catalytic, and signalling roles.  However, a  number
              of spontaneous processes occur under physiological  conditions, including
              oxidation, glycation, isomerization,  racemization, deamidation, and cleavage
              reactions, that lead to  changes in structure that can alter protein function. 
              Asparaginyl  and aspartyl residues represent two of the major sites for such 
              reactions, where intramolecular reactions can result in the  generation of L-
              and D-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl derivatives, as  well as peptide bond
              cleavage.  These studies are aimed at  furthering our understanding of the
              factors that determine the  susceptibility of specific aspartyl and asparaginyl
              residues in  specific proteins to these non-enzymatic reactions.  %%% 
              Spontaneous reactions which occur after formation of proteins can  have
              significant effects on function and biological half-life.  The  studies
              proposed here investigate the mechanism of several  spontaneous processes which
              alter the half-life of hemoglobin.  ***
