Abstract    :
                   Late-stage contractional orogenesis commonly involves a                   
              component of extensional collapse, due to crustal                              
              overthickening, but extension is thought to affect primarily                   
              the upper parts of the system.  The Grenville province of                      
              southern Ontario exposes deeper structural levels of a mid                     
              to late Proterozoic collisional orogeny, and recent results                    
              indicate that this deeper portion also underwent significant                   
              late-stage extension.  This study will examine additional                      
              ductile shear zones that occur in the Grenville in this area                   
              in order to test the idea that late-stage extension is a                       
              fundamental component of  Orogenic architecture in both                        
              shallow and deep structural positions.
