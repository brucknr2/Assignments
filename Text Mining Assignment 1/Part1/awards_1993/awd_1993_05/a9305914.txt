Abstract    :
                   The research entails geometric methods of partial                         
              differential equations applied to variational principles.  This                
              in particular involves the study of classes of harmonic maps from              
              the n-sphere to Riemannian manifolds and their Dirichlet                       
              integral.  Group actions and scalar curvature equations are also               
              intended to be studied.  This research may have potential                      
              applications to configurations of static liquid crystals.
