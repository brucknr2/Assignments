Abstract    :
              9305224  Ochs  This award will support the efforts of the investigator to 
              transfer his database on metabolic pathways and the graphical  user interface
              to the workstation (i.e. UNIX) computer  environment.  Under previous award the
              investigator has developed  databases and related program which present
              metabolic pathways as  a computerize map.   These tools are available to the
              research  community over Internet.  Version of the code run under DOS and 
              Microsoft Windows.  In addition, the current award will allow the 
              investigators to add new functionality of manipulation of  metabolic trees.
