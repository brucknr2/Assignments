Abstract    :
              This award will support the continued development of the                       
              Nucleic Acid                                                                   
              Database, a database of three-dimensional structures of                        
              nucleic acids and                                                              
              their intermolecular complexes.  The goal is to devise an                      
              easily accessible and                                                          
              user friendly resource that serves a broad group of nucleic                    
              acid researchers.  It                                                          
              is anticipated that the users of the database will include                     
              not only structural                                                            
              analysts such as crystallographers, theorists, and NMR                         
              spectroscopists, but                                                           
              also physical chemists who study macroscopic phenomena and                     
              molecular                                                                      
              biologists who focus on the biological properties of these                     
              molecules.                                                                     
              Substantial progress has been made in meeting the goal set                     
              three years ago in                                                             
              establishing the database;  the available crystallographic                     
              data have been                                                                 
              assembled, software has been developed to process and access                   
              the data, and                                                                  
              the information is distributed electronically. The focus now                   
              is to make the                                                                 
              database into a powerful research tool by providing methods                    
              for structure                                                                  
              validation and structure prediction while at the same time                     
              making the primary                                                             
              and derivative data available to the scientific community.
