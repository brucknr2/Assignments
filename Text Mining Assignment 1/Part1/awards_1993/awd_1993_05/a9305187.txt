Abstract    :
              9305187  Mackwell       Only from an understanding of the way in which hydrous
              species  partition at upper mantle conditions will it be possible to  interpret
              mechanical property measurements.  This program will  include static
              experiments on aggregates of mantle minerals under  high pressure and
              temperature conditions, infrared measurements to  characterize the partitioning
              of water-derived species between the  phases, and Mossbauer spectroscopy
              measurements to monitor changes  in the iron valence during uptake of water. 
              This last technique  is particularly important in that it may allow us to use
              iron ionic  ratios and infrared spectroscopy on minerals exposed at the Earth's
               surface to infer water contents and water partitioning at depth.   Finally,
              the inferred effects of this partitioning behavior will  be investigated by
              performing deformation experiments on multiphase  aggregates under wet
              conditions.  ***
