Abstract    :
              The Institute of Statistics and Decision at Duke University will  purchase a
              four processor, 400 MIP, 512 megabyte computer with a  one gigabyte disk, a
              high resolution color printer, and systems  personnel support.  These items
              will be dedicated to the support  of research in the mathematical sciences. 
              The equipment and  services will be used for several research projects,
              including in  particular:  Statistical Image Analysis, Markov Chain Monte Carlo
               Strategies, Multivariate Mixture Models, Optimal Sequential  Designs and
              Stochastic Optimization, and Bayesian Partial  Differential Equation Models.
