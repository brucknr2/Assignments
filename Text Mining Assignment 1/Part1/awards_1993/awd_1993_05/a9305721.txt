Abstract    :
              9305721  Honeycutt    A new telescope will be installed and equipped with
              advanced  instrumentation for automated photometry and spectroscopy.  
              Information on the time variability of astronomical objects is  often critical
              to understanding the nature and evolution of stars  and galaxies.  This new
              telescope will provide a way to acquire  data on a variety of time scales in an
              efficient manner that does  not require the astronomer's presence at the
              telescope.  This is a  new capability for stellar spectroscopy whose
              feasibility has only  recently been demonstrated.  The objects to be studied
              include  cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs).  
              Members of the CV class include dwarf novae and novae.  This new  telescope
              will provide a long-term photometric and spectroscopic  monitoring of several
              kinds of CVs.  Such observations bear  critically on poorly-understood
              evolutionary relations between the  numerous CV types.  The optical variability
              of AGNs and other kinds  of high energy source will also be monitored with the
              new  telescope.  These observations will be correlated with measures at  other
              wavelengths and with particle detector experiments.  The  methods to be
              employed in this work are charge-coupled-device (CCD)  photometry and CCD
              echelle spectroscopy.  The instrumentation will  be carefully matched to the 
              telescope and to the detectors to  provide optimized sensitivity.  The
              completed telescope will also  be used extensively for student training in
              astronomical research,  in astronomical techniques, and in low-light-level
              instrumentation.  ***
