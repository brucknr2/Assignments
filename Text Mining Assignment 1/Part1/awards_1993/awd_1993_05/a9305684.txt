Abstract    :
              9305684  Kreidenweis       This study is aimed at development of an improved 
              understanding of the importance of clouds and cloud processes upon  aerosol
              transport and transformations on both the local and global  scales.  A
              two-dimensional Eulerian cloud domain model study of the  impact of deep
              convection on tropospheric aerosol distribution and  production, with
              particular attention to the upper troposphere,  will be performed. 
              Descriptions of gas- and cloud-phase chemistry  will be coupled with
              mixed-phased quasi-explicit microphysics.   This new model of aerosol formation
              and evolution will be employed  to study the effects of chemistry and transport
              upon aerosol number  and size concentrations.  From this initial work, a 
              parameterization for use with the NCAR Community Climate Model  (CCM2) will be
              developed.  Aerosol optical depths from the climate  model runs will then be
              compared with available satellite  measurements, with a particular view toward
              understanding the role  of clouds in seasonal and latitudinal variations on
              this property.   This work will lead to improved understanding of the
              magnitudes of  cloud effects, and will assist in the prediction of global
              effects  that may occur due to changes in aerosol distributions,  anthropogenic
              emissions or in cloud type and amounts.
