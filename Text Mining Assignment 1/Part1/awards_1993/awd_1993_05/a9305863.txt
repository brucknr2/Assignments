Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics of the University of                        
              Connecticut will purchase equipment which will be dedicated to                 
              the support of research in the mathematical sciences.  The                     
              equipment will be used for several research projects, including                
              in particular:                                                                 
                   .  Structured equations, iterations and applications                      
                      to physics.                                                            
                   .  Geometric problems arising in combinatorial                            
                      notions of dimension and in the mostly graphical                       
                      questions in mathematical physics, analysis and                        
                      number theory which relate to hyperbolic                               
                      manifolds.                                                             
                   .  Nonlinear problems in partial differential                             
                      equations arising generally from engineering                           
                      applications and their numerical computation and                       
                      their visualization.                                                   
                   .  Sampling problems arising in statistics, tomography and                
                      wavelet theory.                                                        
                   .  Algorithmic computational problems in low-                             
                      dimensional topology including normal surface                          
                      decompositions and automatic structures on braid                       
                      groups.
