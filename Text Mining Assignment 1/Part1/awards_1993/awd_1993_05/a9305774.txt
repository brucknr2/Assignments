Abstract    :
                   The Department of Statistics at the University of                         
              Pennsylvania will purchase three Hewlett Packard 9000/735                      
              workstations which will be dedicated to the support of research                
              in the mathematical sciences.  Each will be configured with the                
              necessary hardware and software to provide a distributed cost-                 
              effective floating-point computing system.  This system will be                
              used for the following four research projects:  (1) Hidden Markov              
              Models, Symbolic Computation and Stochastic Calculus, and                      
              Combinatorial Optimization; (2) Surveys, Observational Studies,                
              and Matching; (3) Computational Problems in Statistical Finance;               
              and (4) Time Series Analysis.
