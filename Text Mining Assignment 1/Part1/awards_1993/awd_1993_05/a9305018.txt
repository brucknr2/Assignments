Abstract    :
              9305018  Agrawal       The principal objective of this research is to
              investigate the  role that feedback can play at the cell level control in ATM 
              networks to affect explicitly the amount of excess traffic released  into the
              network.  The thesis is that feedback based schemes can  achieve better
              throughput -- packet loss/delay tradeoffs than  schemes that are essentially
              open-loop at the cell level.  A  layered framework does require the network
              elements to provide  feedback on their congestion level to the access
              regulators.  In  that sense the schemes explored in this research augment the 
              currently emerging framework.  The principal investigator describes  a precise
              mathematical framework for the work and identifies  several time constraints
              and parameters critical in assessing the  efficacy of feedback based schemes.
