Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson University will purchase 
              workstations and a tape backup system.  This equipment will support
              mathematical  modeling and simulator development in the environmental areas of
              subsurface flow,  transport, and hazardous waste remediation.
