Abstract    :
              9305840  Lurie       This research will develop a direct approach to the 
              relaxation of nonselfadjoint problems of optimal design.  The  associated
              min-max problems are investigated applying the notion  of quasi-saddle behavior
              of integrand as the necessary and  sufficient condition for the existence of
              min-max.  We also  develop an alternative approach to the problem reducing it
              to a  standard minimization after the Legendre transform is applied to  the
              adjoint field.  %%%       The goal of the research is to develop a methodology
              for the  determination of optimal structural characteristics of elastic  bodies
              designed for work in a variety of external conditions  (load, static and
              dynamic response, loss of stability,) or under  the action of combined physical
              fields (stresses and temperature,  electric and magnetic fields, etc.)  The
              analytic results will be  implemented in a new numerical technique to compute
              optimal  designs using advanced composites.  This technique will give  truly
              optimal designs as compared to existing methods.  ***
