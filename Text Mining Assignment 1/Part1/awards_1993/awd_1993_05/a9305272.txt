Abstract    :
                9305272     Bralower    In this collaborative, interdisciplinary study, PIs
              will  investigate biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy  and
              stable isotope stratigraphy of a middle Cretaceous marine  sequence in
              northeastern Mexico, representing a time of rapid  global change.  Issues to be
              addressed include:  1) presence of  correlative oceanic anoxic events, 2)
              appropriateness of an oxygen-  minimum-zone model for this sequence, 3)
              potential correlation of  organic-rich sedimentation with sea-level
              fluctuations, 4)  relationship of organic-carbon burial events to record of
              carbon  isotopes, 5) significance of a brief magnetic reversal during this 
              time, 6) are orbital periodicities recorded in this sequence?, 7)  how does the
              expression of cyclicity change along the basin  margin?, 8) timing of evolution
              of planktonic forams during this  time, and 9) how do nannoplankton and
              planktonic forams respond to  events around this time period?  Potential
              drilling sites for  Apticore/Albicore will be evaluated.  ***
