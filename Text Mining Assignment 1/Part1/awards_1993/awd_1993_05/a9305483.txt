Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Hawaii will purchase computer
               equipment and software which will be dedicated to the support of research in
              the  mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects,  including in particular:  Differentiation and the Distribution of
              Zeros of  Functions; Lattice Theory; Learning, Generalization and Model
              Construction in  First-Order Logic; and Symbolic and Numerical Analysis of
              Ordinary and Partial  Differential Equations.  The first project is concerned
              with the effect of differentiation of the  distribution of zeros of polynomials
              and certain other functions.  New techniques  involving geometric mapping
              properties will be employed to study several well--  known conjectures.  The
              second project will use recent advances in free and  finitely presented
              lattices to study unsolved problems in lattice theory,  including solving
              equations in free lattices and finding the covers of finitely  generated
              lattice varieties.  The third project will study various aspects of  mechanical
              theorem proving.  The fourth project will search for normal forms and  natural
              geometric structures associated with control systems.
