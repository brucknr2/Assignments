Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Houston will  purchase, at an
              estimated price of $69,781, a computer system  that will act as a graphics,
              file and compute server dedicated to  support research projects in the
              mathematical sciences.  The  specific projects that will make use of and be
              supported by this  system include:  1) Computing in nonlinear dynamics. 3) The 
              numerical simulation of certain physical processes.  4) Shock  capturing
              methods for reacting flows. 5) Knowledge-based  algorithms.
