Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial support for the 1993 Nuclear                       
              Chemistry Gordon Research Conference, to be held at New London,                
              New Hampshire, 5-9 July.  This year the conference will deal with              
              topics in Nuclear Structure where new large detector arrays and                
              recent advances in radioactive beam techniques have provided new               
              interesting data and corresponding increases in theoretical                    
              activity.
