Abstract    :
                   All statistical procedures result in an inference, a                      
              statement that is based on both the observed data and the assumed              
              model.  Since there are often model assumptions that are                       
              difficult (or impossible) to check, it is desirable for                        
              inferences to be robust against model assumptions.  The                        
              inferences that we are most concerned about are post (data                     
              accuracy measures for confidence sets and hypothesis tests.  Such              
              measures are often derived through decision theoretic or Bayesian              
              arguments, hence are based on assumptions about sampling                       
              distributions, loss functions, and prior distributions.  Here we               
              want to investigate the performance of accuracy estimators, using              
              both frequentist and Bayesian criteria, as the underlying                      
              assumptions are relaxed.  We are most interested in procedures                 
              constructed from default priors, for these tend to perform well                
              under both frequentist and Bayesian scrutiny.  One way that we                 
              will address the sampling robustness is to combine the default                 
              priors with an empirical likelihood to obtain a (somewhat)                     
              automatic inference robust procedure.  Robustness of inference                 
              will be judged using a variety of criteria such as ranges of                   
              posterior probabilities, multiple and distance penalizing loss                 
              functions and a new (and promising) theory of dilation of                      
              probabilities.
