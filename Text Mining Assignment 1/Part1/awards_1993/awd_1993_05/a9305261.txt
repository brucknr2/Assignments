Abstract    :
              9305261  Bogue         The goal of this project is to document the variation of
              the  ancient geomagnetic field intensity during a normal-to-reverse     (N-R)
              polarity transition that occurred approximately 4 million  years ago.  An
              existing sample collection from 28 superposed  basaltic lava flows from the
              Hawaiian island of Kauai provides a  paleomagnetic record of this reversal. 
              Paleointensities of these  samples  will be determined using a modified version
              of the        classic double-heating experiment.  Finally, this study will 
              continue an ongoing effort to improve the efficiency of the  paleointensity
              experiment by letter identifying samples that are  likely to undergo serious
              thermal alteration in the lab.  Research  will focus on low-temperature
              demagnetization, both in preliminary  rock magnetic experiments and during the
              paleointensity experiment  itself.  Undergraduate students will play a central
              role in this  research.  ***
