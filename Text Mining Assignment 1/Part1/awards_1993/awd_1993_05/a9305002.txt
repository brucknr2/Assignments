Abstract    :
              9305002  Biltonen  A study of the activation of the phospholipase A2 from
              Agkistrodon  piscivorus piscivorus will be undertaken utilizing site directed 
              mutagenesis and a variety of biophysical techniques.  It is  hypothesized that
              dimerization is required for full activation of  the interfacial enzyme. 
              Multidimensional NMR, calorimetry, thermal  denaturation, and fluorescence
              kinetic studies will be involved.  %%%  Major controversy surrounds the
              mechanism of interfacial catalysis  by phospholipase A2s.  These enzymes are
              involved in a wide variety  of physiological responses.  The studies planned
              here will test the  hypothesis that the enzyme functions as a homodimer. 
              DIrect  physical characterization of the physical state of the enzyme will  be
              used to answer this question.  ***
