Abstract    :
                   Proposed research will continue to develop and apply the                  
              methods of nonlinear dynamics to atomic absorption spectra.                    
              Quantum signatures of bifurcation, the limits of closed-orbit                  
              theory and applications to semiconductor microjunctions will                   
              be studied.
