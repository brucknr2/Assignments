Abstract    :
              Major mountain systems are in part the result of large                         
              infusions of magma bought on by the interaction of plates at                   
              subduction zones.  A classic problem in geology has been the                   
              "room problem", namely how are large volumes (thousands of                     
              cubic miles) of magma physically accommodated in the earth's                   
              crust, i.e., how is the requisit space created.  The                           
              investigators have recently proposed a mechanical model that                   
              explains how space for magmas can be created via P-                            
              fractures.   This project will test this hypothesis by                         
              gathering field data and by conducting computer experiments.                   
              This project also has the potential of providing insights                      
              into the structural controls on ore deposits that may lead                     
              ultimately to improved strategies for exploration.
