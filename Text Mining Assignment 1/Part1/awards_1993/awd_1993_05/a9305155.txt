Abstract    :
              9305155  Wong       This award provides partial funding to construct a servo- 
              controlled pressure generation system and to purchase equipment to  upgrade an
              experimental facility for the study of brittle rock  deformation under
              confining pressure. The upgraded testing  apparatus is to be installed and
              operated in the Department of  Earth and Space Sciences at the State University
              of New York in  Stony Brook. The University is committed to providing the
              remaining  funds needed for the equipment upgrade.       The apparatus is
              needed for research in the Principal  Investigator's laboratory on the
              mechanism of rock rupture as the  cause of earthquakes.  ***
