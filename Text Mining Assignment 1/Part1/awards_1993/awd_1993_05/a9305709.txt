Abstract    :
              The long-term goal of PI, collaborating with Canadian and African              
              colleagues, is to develop a sequence stratigraphic framework for               
              the Neoproterozoic succession in northwest Namibia.  In this pilot             
              project, PI will develop a stratigraphic transect across the Kaoko             
              Belt and Northern Platform, as well as establish the areas having              
              the most complete sections in more deformed belts to the west.                 
              This work will form the basis for hypothesis development with                  
              regard to the pre-Pan African depositional and tectonostratigraphic            
              evolution of the region.
