Abstract    :
              9305115     Ammar       A significant obstacle to achieving heterogeneous system
               interconnection is the need to maintain compatible network  protocols on all
              communication systems.  Protocol standardization  and profiling has long been
              viewed as a way to overcome this  obstacle.  The exclusive nature of this
              approach, however, presents  certain limitations.  Among them are exclusion of
              sometimes  superior technology and the necessity for strict agreement among 
              systems.  This research will consider an inclusive approach for  achieving
              inter-operability based on the use of multi-protocol  architectures, that is
              systems with a mixture of protocols from  different standards families. 
              Inter-operability in these  architectures is achieved by 1) providing
              sufficient overlap in the  protocols that systems implement and 2) equipment
              systems with the  mechanisms that can be used to determine this overlap.  The
              work  will have two major components:  a model building activity which  will
              help focus the work and help in identifying problems and  solutions and a
              parallel implementation activity based on a case  study of Internet and OSI
              protocol suites.  ***
