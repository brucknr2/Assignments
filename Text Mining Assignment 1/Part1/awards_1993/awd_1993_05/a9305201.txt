Abstract    :
              9305201  Hervig       The secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS or ion
              microprobe)  at Arizona State University will be modified to improve the 
              performance of the primary ion beam (smaller diameter and, hence,  better
              analytical spatial resolution). A better vacuum will also  be achieved,
              resulting in a lowering of detection limits,  especially for light volatile
              elements. The instrument  modifications will be designed, built and tested
              in-house by the  Principal Investigator and colleagues. The improved ASU ion 
              microprobe will be available to on-campus and off-campus  researchers, and will
              be used primarily in earth sciences projects  to determine isotope and trace
              element compositions of geological  and meteorite samples with a spatial
              resolution on the order of  several micrometers.  ***
