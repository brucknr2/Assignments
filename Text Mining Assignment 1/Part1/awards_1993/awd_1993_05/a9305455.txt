Abstract    :
              9305455  Yu  The overall objective of this research is to elucidate the role of 
              supernumeral subunit IV (Mr = 14,384), in the cytochrome bc1  complex of a
              photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides.   Although previous studies
              indicate that subunit IV is an integral  part of this bacterial bc1 complex and
              is involved in Q-binding,  the structure and other function(s) of this subunit
              are yet to be  established.  The PI intends to investigate the role and
              structure-  function relationship of this protein through gene deletion, 
              complementation, and site-directed and/or random in vitro  mutagenesis in
              concert with physical, chemical, and biological  characterizations.  %%%  The
              success of this project will increase understanding of the  structure-function
              and mechanism of this photosynthetic bacterial  bc1 complex.  The knowledge
              gained from this research will provide  a better understanding of energy
              transduction mechanisms in the  photosynthetic apparatus, and thus improvement
              in photosynthetic  efficiency and herbicide design, and will enhance
              understanding  of mitochondrial bioenergetics.  Such an understanding could
              lead  to increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis and thus increase  the
              renewable energy sources.  ***
