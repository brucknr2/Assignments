Abstract    :
              Kanade         This project is building and deploying an intelligent  imaging
              sensor for road following.  The sensor generates the  heading information
              required to steer a robotic vehicle by  watching the road.  On-chip processing
              is performed by a neural  network trained to drive autonomously on public
              highways.  The  circuitry which performs the neural computations is integrated 
              with a photosensor array in order to directly sense road-image  information. 
              The photosensor array includes analog signal  processing in each cell and
              binary optics for better photon  statistics, decreased transducer size, and
              less interference.
