              Berger will carry out a program of computational research on classical and
              quantum gravitation.  Although Einstein's general theory of relativity is an
              experimentally verified description of observed gravitational phenomena, its
              classical equations generically develop singularities from regular initial data
              and are inconsistent with the principles of quantum mechanics.          In the
              context of the early Universe, studies of the quantum mechanics of cosmologies
              and of the properties of the most general cosmological spacetimes might suggest
              how to overcome these intrinsic limitations of general relativity.  Quantum
              cosmology serves as a theoretical laboratory within which to test both
              approaches to quantum gravity and possible quantum gravitational effects in the
              early Universe.  The application of standard quantum Monte Carlo simulation
              methods to quantum cosmology (and ultimately to quantum gravity) allows
              realistic universes with many degrees of freedom to be studied. ***
