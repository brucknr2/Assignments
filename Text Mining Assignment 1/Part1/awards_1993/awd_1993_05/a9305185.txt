Abstract    :
              A series of experiments will be undertaken on clays under differing            
              silica, aluminum, and potassium concentrations, at temperatures                
              from 25oC up to 300oC.  The new experimental technique for the                 
              proposed research has been thoroughly tested.  It incorporates the             
              dual pumping of solutions through two feeder-bombs containing                  
              quartz or boehmite which provide, by their equilibrium solubilities            
              at controlled temperatures, fixed but adjustable silica and                    
              aluminum concentrations in the input solutions.  In the proposed               
              experiments, the narrowly sized clay samples will be suspended as              
              fluidized bed within the reactor.  Samples of both the solid and               
              the solutions will then be extracted during each run to track the              
              reaction progress, and a variety of analytical techniques will be              
              used to evaluate compositional changes in the fluids and solids and            
              the structural state of the illite/smectite sample.  The results of            
              these experiments will be important in several respects.  First,               
              they will provide kinetic data for modeling fluid-flow and                     
              diagenesis on a basin scale.  In such models the release of water,             
              reduction in porosity, and change in fluid chemistry and pressure              
              associated with illitization are important processes that have to              
              date been highly parameterized.  Secondly, they should resolve the             
              mechanism of the smectite to illite transformation.  An active                 
              controversy persists as to whether illitization proceeds via a                 
              solid-state or a dissolution-reprecipitation path.  In our                     
              experiments, the ability to control the fluid composition and flow             
              rate (hence "closedness" of the system) allows us to assess whether            
              these factors affect the rates and energetics of the reaction and              
              whether they are dominated by mass transport of surface kinetics               
              through an elemental reaction or through multiple pathways.  In                
              addition to its significance to the kinetics of illitization, the              
              work proposed here will extend the valuable equilibrium solubility             
              results of May et al.  (1986)and of Aja et al.  (1991a, b) on the              
              stabilities of phases in the K2O-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O system.  The               
              experimental results should also resolve whether the fundamental               
              particle explanation is solution or a mixture of multiple phases               
              (e.g., Tardy and Fritz, 1981; Aagaard and Helgeson, 1983; Nadeau et            
              al., 1984; Garrels, 1984; and Altaner, 1988).
