Abstract    :
                9305930  Goldstein       The investigator intends to continue his analysis of
              Bohmian  mechanics, which defines a deterministic dynamical system  involving a
              novel combination of ordinary and partial  differential equations having
              remarkable properties.  The  proposed research involves the analysis of several
              rather  distinct components: 1) the basic mathematical properties of the 
              system itself, such as existence and uniqueness of the dynamics;  2)
              phenomenology, such as the emergence of the quantum formalism  and of the
              classical limit; and 3) extensions to relativity and  covariant gravitation. 
              %%%       The importance of the proposed research lies in the  following
              observations.  1) The foundations of quantum theory  continue to be mired in
              confusion and incoherence some sixty five  years after its inception.  2)
              Bohmian mechanics is the natural  embedding of Schroedinger's equation -- the
              mathematical core of  almost all interpretations of quantum theory -- into a
              clear,  precise physical theory, emerging if one merely insists that the 
              Schroedinger wave function be relevant to the motion of  particles.  3) An
              appreciation of Bohmian mechanics can be the  source of flexibility and clarity
              when one attempts to apply  quantum theory in new directions -- for example, to
              understand  the implications of macroscopic interference effects -- and to  new
              domains, such as quantum gravity.  ***
