Abstract    :
              This project will focus on fluid evolution in the upper part                   
              of the hydrothermal system at the Archean Wiluna lode-gold                     
              deposits.  The mixing of surface and deep-seated ore fluids                    
              may be an important precipitation mechanism for gold and                       
              other metals.  The goal of this study is to constrain                          
              surface water components in the Wiluna deposits, and to                        
              quantify fluid fluxes in the metasomatic zones.  This will                     
              be the first to study the nature and role of surface waters                    
              in Archean lode-gold systems.  The surface water components                    
              of the fossil hydrothermal system will be quantified by                        
              GC/IC, PIXE-probe, and noble gas analyses on fluid                             
              inclusions, and stable isotope analyses on homogeneous                         
              groups of fluid inclusions and alteration minerals.  Mass-                     
              transfer modeling will quantify fluid flow through channel                     
              ways and wallrock, and will quantify fluid mixing as a gold                    
              precipitation mechanism in the upper parts of the lodes.                       
              This research will be conducted in collaboration with the                      
              Key Centre for Strategic Mineral Deposits, Perth and the                       
              Bureau of Mineral Resources, Canberra.
