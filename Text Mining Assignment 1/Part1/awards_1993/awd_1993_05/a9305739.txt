Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University                 
              in the purchase of an x-ray diffractometer and an associated                   
              data analysis system.  This new instrumentation will enhance                   
              greatly research in a number of areas including the following:                 
                                                                                             
              1)  Solid state reactions of metal complexes,                                  
              2)  Sterically encumbered ligands,                                             
              3)  The conformational analysis of type I and type II B-turns                  
              in model polypeptides,                                                         
              4)  Ion pair structures,                                                       
              5)  Applications of organometallic chemistry to materials                      
              science and organic synthesis.  From molecular wires to                        
              enantioselective reagents,                                                     
              6)  Development of new synthetic methods and their application                 
              of total synthesis.                                                            
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The x-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise                  
              measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a                      
              molecule.  The information obtained gives the precise values of                
              all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and                 
              it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of                 
              that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
