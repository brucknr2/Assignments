Abstract    :
              9305060  Stixrude         The PI's will investigate the physics of the core's
              most  abundant constituent, iron, at high pressures and temperatures, 
              including its sub-solidus phase relations, the thermo-elasticity of  its solid
              and liquid phases, dynamic properties of the melt and the  iron melting curve. 
              The properties of face-centered cubic,  hexagonal close packed and body
              centered cubic crystalline  structures are investigated with first principles
              solutions of  Schrodinger's Equation based on density functional theory.  They 
              will construct parametric model Hamiltonians to represent the  theoretical
              results and use this model in molecular dynamics  simulations of the equation
              of state, structure and viscosity of  liquid iron.  The model Hamiltonian will
              also be used in high  pressure cluster simulations of iron melting.  The aim of
              the  project is to predict and provide a firm theoretical basis for a 
              discussion of the temperature distribution in the core, the  composition of the
              solid inner core and liquid outer core and the  crystal structure of the inner
              core.  ***
