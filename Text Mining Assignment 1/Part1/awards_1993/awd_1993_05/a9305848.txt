Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for investigation of geometric evolution                 
              processes such as might model dendritic growth of a crystal                    
              freezing from its melt.  The mathematical setting is that of                   
              geometric measure theory in which crystals are sets of finite                  
              perimeter and temperature and concentration fields are functions               
              belonging to appropriate Sobolev spaces.  The final evolution is               
              a limit of discrete time approximations in which crystal                       
              geometries are determined by solving variational problems and                  
              fields evolve by diffusion equations.
