Abstract    :
                   Adaptive sampling designs are designs in which the procedure              
              for selecting the units to include in the sample may depend on                 
              observed values of the variable of interest.  In previous                      
              research supported by NSF grants DMS-8705812 and DMS-9016708, the              
              methodology of adaptive sampling was advanced to the point where               
              now there are a number of practical adaptive designs, giving                   
              remarkably high efficiencies for sampling rare, clumped, or                    
              aggregated populations compared to conventional designs of                     
              equivalent sample size.  Theoretical results suggest, however,                 
              that greater potential still exists.  It is proposed to further                
              develop the basic theory of adaptive sampling and look for new                 
              classes of adaptive sampling designs.                                          
                   Adaptive sampling designs are designs in which the procedure              
              for selecting the units or sites to include in the sample depends              
              on observations made during the survey.  For example, in a survey              
              to estimate the abundance of a rare animal species, additional                 
              observations may be made in the vicinity of sites with high                    
              observed abundance.  In a survey of an environmental pollutant,                
              additional observations may be made in the vicinity of discovered              
              ``hot spots.''  For such surveys, adaptive sampling designs can                
              provide estimates of far greater precision than can be obtained                
              with conventional designs of equivalent sampling effort.                       
              Research is proposed to develop the theory and methods of                      
              adaptive sampling. The proposed research  has immediate,                       
              important applications to many fields, including environmental,                
              ecological, and natural resource studies.
