Abstract    :
                   The proposal covers a scope of research by an active geometry             
              group.  The group is active in several areas:  geometric analysis,             
              algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.  Such research would              
              have applications to soliton theory (e.g. telecommunications and               
              signals) and other areas such as vortices and quantum field theory.            
              The proposal requests support for graduate students and related                
              instructional activities.
