Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The wing of Drosophila is a relatively simple but highly ordered               
              tissue. It contains a limited number of histologically identifiable            
              cell types arranged into a precise pattern of structures. The                  
              decision to form a particular cell type is made for the most part              
              during the latter stages of the growth of the wing imaginal disc               
              and Dr. Blair is examining the mechanisms underlying these events.             
              He here proposes to look at the problem of patterned formation of              
              wing veins. The specific aims are as follows: 1) To isolate and                
              characterize cell-specific vein markers which will allow him to                
              follow the process of vein formation in detail; screening known                
              genes as well as new enhancer trap lines, has already led to the               
              isolation of markers which are specific for preveins, mature veins,            
              and the posterior cross vein, 2) To use these markers to follow the            
              effects of different classes of venation mutations during                      
              development. Newly developed techniques will allow an investigation            
              of the effects of both viable and embryonic lethal mutations and               
              future studies will also make use of techniques for the localized              
              over expression of genes. The purpose of these studies is to                   
              identify critical steps in the venation process and the genes                  
              required for each. Also addressed will be issues of cell autonomy              
              of such mutations and the roles played by genes during the cell-               
              cell interactions critical to the patterning process, 3) To                    
              initiate the genetic and molecular characterization of novel and               
              previously characterized vein-pattern genes, and 4) To perform                 
              surgical manipulations to the disc in order to better understand               
              the cell-cell interactions required for vein patterning.
