Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Adolphson to                
              work in number theory.  This project will explore the connections              
              between exponential sums over finite fields and toric varieties.               
              Two major topics will be pursued.  The first topic is the study                
              of the p-adic differential equations that arise from the                       
              variation of cohomology of families of exponential sums.  The                  
              second topic is the study of the p-adic cohomology of complete                 
              intersections.                                                                 
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
