Abstract    :
              The major focus of this research is a detailed investigation                   
              of the atomic and electronic structures of oriented, single                    
              crystal surfaces of several geochemically and                                  
              environmentally  important oxide minerals (alpha-SiO2, alpha-                  
              Al2O3, and alpha-Fe2O3).  The samples will be studied before                   
              and after reaction with water and electrolyte solutions by                     
              surface-sensitive synchrotron radiation methods including X-                   
              Ray Standing Waves, Surface Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine                     
              Structure, and core level photemission techniques.  The                        
              results of these studies will ultimately find application in                   
              the environmental geochemistry field in understanding how                      
              water and aqueous metal ions interact with mineral surfaces.                   
              A second focus of this project is the continuation of a high                   
              temperature x-ray absorption spectroscopy study of silicate                    
              liquids.  Data collected on Ni2+ and Ge in Ni-germanate                        
              liquids and on Ni in silicate liquids will be used to obtain                   
              quantitative information on the local environment of these                     
              cations as a function of temperature.
