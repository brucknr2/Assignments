Abstract    :
              The main objective of this research is the study of computational  and
              constructive aspects of orthogonal polynomials.  Special  attention is to be
              given to the development and analysis of  constructive methods for generating
              orthogonal polynomials of  Sobolev type, i.e., polynomials that are orthogonal
              with respect  to an inner product involving derivatives.  These have originally
               been introduced to approximate functions and their derivative  simultaneously,
              and have since received a considerable amount of  attention but largely from
              approximation-theoretic and algebraic  points of view and with little regard to
              computational aspects.  Other topics to be considered involve the question of
              computing  polynomials orthogonal relative to a Hermite weight on a finite 
              interval and the analysis of the remainder terms of special  quadrature rules. 
               Orthogonal polynomials are basic tools of approximation.  They  provide
              orthogonal expansions and least square approximations to  functions and
              contribute to a variety of quadrature processes. In  addition they are used
              extensively in the numerical solution of  ordinary differential equations and
              in the application of  iterative methods for solving systems of linear
              algebraic  equations.
