Abstract    :
              9305708  Prave       PI will construct an outcrop-based sequence stratigraphic 
              framework for upper member Crystal Spring Formation and Stirling  through Wood
              Canyon formations section of the Proterozoic-Cambrian  sequence in the Death
              Valley region.  Goals include:  1) testing  conflicting hypotheses with regard
              to tectonic setting of  deposition; 2) correlation to a better-dated
              succession; 3)  attempting to determine if regionally significant bounding
              surfaces  indicate significant hiatuses; and 4) testing paleogeographic 
              consequences of palinspastic reconstructions.
