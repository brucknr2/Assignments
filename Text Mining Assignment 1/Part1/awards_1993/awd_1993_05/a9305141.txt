Abstract    :
              The principal objective of this research project is to                         
              conduct laboratory experiments that will provide the                           
              foundation for quantitative prediction of mineral-water                        
              reactions.  This research will ultimately find application                     
              in studies of groundwater aquifers and of fluid-mediated                       
              processes both at the Earth's surface and at depth.  The                       
              proposed experiments involve measurement of dissolution                        
              rates, leaching, and hydrogen penetration for plagioclase,                     
              olivine and pyroxene.  Leaching experiments will be                            
              conducted up to 800oC and over a pH range of 1 to 7.                           
              Techniques used to measure surface hydrogen and metal cation                   
              inventories include SIMS, RNRA, XPS, and Auger electron                        
              spectroscopy.
