Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Research Planning Grant will concentrate on developing                    
              techniques for measuring the growth rate of calcareous algae in                
              carbonate reefs of Panama.  It has been hypothesized that these                
              algae may contribute a substantial amount to the total amount of               
              carbon fixed into calcite in reef settings. The author will monitor            
              the growth rate of individual algae and calculate the number of                
              calcite particles produced and their ultimate fate--whether they               
              are preserved in the sediment, thus burying carbon in the sediment             
              or altered, thus releasing carbon back into the water.  The long-              
              range goal is to determine whether atmospheric levels of CO2 might             
              be affected by changes in algal production resulting from sealevel             
              variations.
