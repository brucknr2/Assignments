Abstract    :
              9305376  Gerla       This project involves the problem of supporting
              connectionless  service in an ATM network.  The urgency of this problem stems
              from  the need to interconnect LANs and MANs (typically, operated in a 
              connectionless mode) to the connection oriented ATM.  The problem  is quite
              challenging because the ATM network requires that users  set up connections and
              declare in advance the expected traffic on  each connection.  The network then
              uses this information to  allocate bandwidth to individual users. 
              Connectionless sources, on  the other hand, are by their nature unpredictable,
              thus eluding  the ATM bandwidth allocation strategy, and potentially
              compromising  network efficiency.   In this project, a scheme - the 
              Connectionless Server (CLS) overlay network - is investigated. This  scheme
              permits efficient handling of connectionless traffic in ATM.   Various design
              options (topology connectivity, bandwidth  allocation, buffer management, etc.)
              are examined, and performance  models and criteria for their selection are
              developed.  The CLS  scheme will be compared with other connectionless support
              schemes   (Bandwidth Reservation and On-the-Fly Transmission) and the 
              respective pros  and cons will be evaluated.  Finally, a hybrid  scheme
              combining features of al of the schemes will be examined in  an attempt to
              combine their benefits while avoiding their pitfalls.  ***
