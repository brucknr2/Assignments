Abstract    :
              This SGER project will examine the feasibility of generating ice               
              in the decompression region of a supersonic jet, followed by a                 
              supersonic ice-blasting abrasion for the removal of paint and                  
              corrosion from a broad variety of industrial structures.  This                 
              approach will replace sand blasting abrasion, which has                        
              significant environmental and economic drawbacks.  The ability                 
              to generate at the desired location ice crystals of appropriate                
              size for abrasive purposes has to be demonstrated.  Various                    
              abrasive particles, that become residue immediately after                      
              abrasion, are replaced by water that is available at almost any                
              location.  A simplified analytical model for flow and heat                     
              transfer around small particles entrained by a supersonic jet                  
              indicates that water droplets will be formed.  The proposed                    
              experiments will test the model assumptions, identify other                    
              related phenomena, and finally test the feasibility of the                     
              approach.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This exploratory research is relevant to environmentally benign                
              manufacturing (e.g. abrasive blasting of nuclear power                         
              facilities  or coated mills) and to maintaining the civil                      
              infrastructure (e.g. cleaning of the lead-based paints from                    
              bridges, large structures and equipment, as well as toxic                      
              sandblasting storage).
