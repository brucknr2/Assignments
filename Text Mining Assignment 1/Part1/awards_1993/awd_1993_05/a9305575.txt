Abstract    :
              9305575  Klein    This is an experimental and theoretical study of phase
              separation,  ordering, and crystallization kinetics in metal alloys.  Research 
              on kinetics of martensitic transformations emphasizes simultaneous  ordering
              and shape change reactions occurring in copper/gold  alloys.  The research also
              includes time-resolved studies of  quasimartensitic kinetics in which the
              martensitic reaction is  slowed by heat diffusion.  The crystallization
              kinetics near  spinodals is a focus in the theoretical and simulation effort.  
              Both homogeneous and heterogenous nucleation are considered.  The  concept of
              liquid forming a "clump" phase at a spinodal point is  examined.  Ordering is
              examined in FeAl and FeCo alloys.    %%%  This research expands our knowledge
              base on the kinetics associated  with several phase transformations.  Phase
              transformations play an  essential role in the processing and properties of
              technologically  important materials.  ***
