Abstract    :
                   Crystal equilibrium and growth problems involving                         
              anisotropic surface energy and/or mobility will be investigated,               
              with and without diffusion.  New theoretical frameworks for                    
              considering such problems will be developed, as will new                       
              algorithms and computer programs for computing their solutions.                
              In particular, the crystalline approach will be further developed              
              and applied to new problems.  In this context, variational                     
              problems often become finite dimensional, and parabolic partial                
              differential equations for surface motion become systems of                    
              ordinary differential equations.  The general context for                      
              this work is geometric measure theory.
