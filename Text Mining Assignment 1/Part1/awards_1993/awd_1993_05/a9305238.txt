              and theoretical investigations of nuclear                                      
              structure for A=130 transitional nuclei is                                     
              proposed by physicists from SUNY Stony Brook and                               
              the University of Warsaw.  Electromagnetic                                     
              transition probabilities and .-ray spectroscopy                                
              studies are to be employed to examine the                                      
              participation of shape degrees of freedom in the                               
              structure of these nuclei.  Collaborative                                      
              experiments will be carried out using heavy-ion                                
              beams from the Stony Brook superconducting LINAC                               
              along with the BGO-suppressed Ge-detector array.                               
              Data analysis and theoretical interpretation will                              
              be carried out on computers both in Stony Brook                                
              and Warsaw.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project in physics fulfills the program                                   
              objectives of advancing science by enabling                                    
              leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine                              
              complementary talents and pool research resources                              
              in areas of strong mutual interest and
