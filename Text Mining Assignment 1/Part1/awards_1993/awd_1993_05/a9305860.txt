Abstract    :
              9305860  Lindenfeld    This research will investigate the transition from the
              metallic,  superconducting state to the insulating, magnetically ordered state 
              in layered cuprate oxide materials, the high-Tc systems.  Thin  films from a
              few atom-layers to several unit cells in thickness  will be grown and
              characterized by a number of methods.  The  conducting properties will be
              changed by varying the composition of  the materials which are prepared by
              laser-ablation techniques.  The  evolution of spin fluctuations and magnetic
              order will be  investigated as the superconductivity disappears with
              compositional  changes.  In collaboration with colleagues, the materials will
              be  characterized by x-ray and neutron diffraction and electrical  transport
              measurements.  %%%  This project deals with the growth and characterization of
              high-Tc  films.  A major interest is how the superconducting properties  change
              or disappear as films of the materials are grown atom by  atom.  The authors
              will use structural and electrical techniques to  characterize the thin film
              materials and investigate the interplay  between magnetic and superconducting
              properties of the materials.   The results have importance for fundamental
              aspects of  superconductivity as well as technological relevance in the context
               of preparing new superconducting layered structures.  ***
