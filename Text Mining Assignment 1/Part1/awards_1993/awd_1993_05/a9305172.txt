Abstract    :
                9305172  Zeng                               This research continues successful
              theoretical developments  supported under previous NSF funding on multiple
              seismic energy  scattering.  Here, the researcher will extend the numerical 
              simulation of the multiply scattered wave in a non-uniform  absorption and
              scattering medium, explore various factors affecting  the observed seismic coda
              decay, study the effect of anisotropic  scattering processes on the seismic
              scattering wave decay,  incorporate a depth-dependent velocity structure,
              compare seismic  scattering effects between realistic heterogeneous models, and
               apply the theoretical results to real data.  The work will have  important
              application to the estimation of the coda magnitude and  site amplification, to
              the Q variation as a possible precursor to  earthquake prediction, to the study
              of crustal heterogeneity and  rheology structure and to the extension of the
              coda study to the  early strong part of the earthquake shaking which
              progressively  damages buildings.  This research is a component of the National
               Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
