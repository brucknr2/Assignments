Abstract    :
              This work is aimed at understanding the molecular basis for                    
              specific recognition of nucleic acids by proteins, and the factors             
              involved in their regulatory interactions, both in vivo and in                 
              vitro.  The work described in this grant proposal focuses on the               
              trp repressor of E. coli (TrpR), with the following goals:  1)                 
              Determination of the sequence requirements for tandem, cooperative             
              binding of repressor to DNA; 2) Determination of the binding mode              
              used by the repressor in vivo on natural operators; 3)  Measurement            
              of the bending of tandem and single operator DNA's in vitro in the             
              presence and absence of repressor; 4)  Measurement of the                      
              thermodynamic parameters associated with DNA binding in the tandem             
              and single modes; 5) Determination of the effect of crystallization            
              conditions on specific and nonspecific DNA binding affinity; and 6)            
              Determination of the folding and ligand-binding properties of a                
              fragment of TrpR.                                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              To carry out their regulatory functions, proteins exercise precise             
              recognition of nucleic acid sequences, correctly identifying their             
              true targets against a vast background of nonspecific sequences.               
              In the last quarter century, biochemical and genetic studies have              
              pointed to a high degree of chemical complementarily between the               
              protein and nucleic acid partners in specific complexes.  The                  
              current state of knowledge about the TrpR-DNA interaction suggests             
              that the distinction between specific and non specific binding is              
              due to an interplay of factors, including subtle energetic                     
              considerations.  The experiments proposed here are aimed at                    
              provided a complete picture for TrpR.
