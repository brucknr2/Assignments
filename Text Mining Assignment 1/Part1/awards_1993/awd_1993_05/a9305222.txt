Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a workshop conference that will bring together research                
              scientists and representatives from commercial firms that produce              
              instruments in an attempts to find mechanisms for producing                    
              improved sampling and analytical devices for chemical oceanographic            
              studies.  The structure of the meeting will be designed to maximize            
              interaction between commercial instrument builders and research                
              scientists and will be very different from a typical scientific                
              meeting.  Instead of set-piece descriptions of completed science               
              projects, the oceanographers will be ask to discuss the problems               
              that they face in turning technological developments in other                  
              fields into useful devices that can advance knowledge of marine                
              chemistry and chemical oceanography.  Similarly, the business                  
              representatives will be invited to talk about the problems that                
              they face in producing instruments for the rather small market that            
              is represented by the oceanographic community.                                 
                                                                                             
              After initial presentations that outline the problems and                      
              prospects, a large portions of the time will be devoted to informal            
              discussions during which it is hoped that fruitful alliances                   
              between research scientists and instrument building businesses will            
              develop.
