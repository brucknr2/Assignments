Abstract    :
              9305017  Kumar       The nonlinear Kerdock and Preparata codes have been
              something  of an enigma in coding theory since they are both Hamming distance 
              invariant and have weight enumerators that are dual under the  MacWilliams
              transform just as if they were dual linear codes.   Recent research by the
              author and other researchers has provided an  explanation for this phenomenon,
              namely that the two nonlinear  binary codes are projections under the Gray
              mapping of two  quaternary codes that are linear and which are in fact, duals!
              The  connection with quaternary codes has brought up a whole host of 
              interesting questions relating to linear quaternary codes, linear  and
              nonlinear binary codes, sequences and lattices.       In the research project,
              such questions are being  investigated.  It is expected that the research will
              have both  practical and theoretical benefits.  ***
