Abstract    :
                   The Department of Statistics at Virginia Polytechnic  Institute and State
              University will purchase equipment that will  be dedicated to support research
              in the mathematical sciences.   Additionally, support of a half-time system
              programmer/analyst  for two years.       The planned projects address issues in
              graphical  representations (visualization) and numerical methodological 
              computations and simulations.       Two of the projects involve the development
              of Bayesian  computational methods which are generally computationally 
              intensive and require state-of-the-art numerical, symbolic, and  graphical
              computing capabilities.  A second area is the area of  nonparametric density
              estimation and nonparametric regression.   Finally, interest is focused on the
              development of highly  interactive dynamic graphical methods.
