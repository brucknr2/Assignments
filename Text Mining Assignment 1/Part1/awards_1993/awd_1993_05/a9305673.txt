Abstract    :
              Two sequential annual workshops on research areas associated with              
              probabilistic methods in mechanics of materials will be held.                  
              The first workshop will occur during June 29-July 1, 1993 at The               
              Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.  The second is                
              tentatively scheduled for the last week in June of 1994 at CUA.                
              The workshops will explore the following topics: (1) Experimental              
              determination of the statistical properties of the microstructure              
              of materials.  This would include materials ranging from                       
              commercially  pure metals to composite materials.                              
              (2) Characterization of the microstructure in terms of                         
              statistical quantities.  (3) Development of theories to predict                
              the macroscopic properties of materials from the statistical                   
              properties of microstructure.  (4) Development of processing                   
              methods to obtain a material with given statistical properties of              
              the microstructure.
