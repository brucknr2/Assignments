Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proper form of a multicellular organism requires precise                   
              control of terminal differentiation events.  This research will                
              address how a single terminal differentiation event is executed                
              during the development of a simple model organism, the nematode C.             
              elegans.  The analysis will focus on the terminal differentiation              
              of lateral hypodermal "seam" cells, which terminally differentiate             
              during the final (4th) molt.  Several distinct cellular processes              
              are coordinately controlled during this terminal differentiation               
              event, including cell cycle, cell fusion, and the stage-specific               
              regulation of cuticle gene expression.  A gene called lin-29 has               
              been identified as a pivotal component in programming the execution            
              of seam cell terminal differentiation.  Loss of lin-29 function                
              causes hypodermal cells of the adult stage to reiterate                        
              indefinitely the larval program of cell divisions instead of                   
              exiting the cell cycle and differentiating.  lin-29 encodes a                  
              putative transcription factor of the (Cys)2-(His)2 class, and, thus            
              likely programs these events by regulating the transcription of                
              other genes.  The major objective of this work is to identify genes            
              controlled by the lin-29 protein.  Three approaches will be                    
              employed to identify lin-29-regulated genes.  ?1! Interactions of              
              lin-29 protein with predicted target genes:  The stage-specific                
              expression of the cuticle collagen genes, col-17 and col-19, will              
              be analyzed.  col-17 expression is transcriptionally repressed                 
              during the larval/adult switch, whereas col-19 expression is                   
              activated.  The role of lin-29 in the alternative repression and               
              activation of these genes will be tested.  ?2! Differential                    
              hybridization screens to identify genes whose expression is                    
              influenced by the presence or absence of lin-29 protein:  Genes                
              isolated in this fashion will be examined for direct regulation by             
              lin-29, and those directly regulated will be characterized further.            
              ?3! Development of a protein-DNA UV crosslinking method to isolate             
              DNA sequences bound by a specific protein in vivo:  In the future,             
              this method will be used to identify genes bound by lin-29 protein             
              in vivo, and should also be applicable to the isolation of genes               
              controlled by other C. elegans gene-regulatory proteins.  Genes                
              involved in cell cycle exit and cell fusion, as well as additional             
              stage-specifically expressed cuticle genes, should be identified by            
              these methods.  Analysis of the types of genes regulated by lin-29             
              in vivo will lead to an understanding of how a complex terminal                
              differentiation program is orchestrated at a specific time during              
              development.
