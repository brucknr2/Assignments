Abstract    :
              9305354  Slonczewski       The genetic mechanisms of resistance to extreme acid
              and of pH  homeostasis is being investigated in Escherichia coli and its close 
              relative Shigella flexneri.  Genes have been identified which are  required for
              stationary-phase induction of resistance to extreme  acid (pH 2-3).  These
              include katF and several Tn5 insertions of  unknown location.  The following
              questions are being addressed:   What are the roles of pH and anaerobiosis is
              stationary-phase acid  resistance?  Which gene products participate in acid
              resistance,  and how are they regulated?  Do some acid-resistance loci also 
              participate in pH homeostasis during growth?  Does stationary phase  also
              confer alkaline resistance response?  The objectives are:   observe pH
              dependence, if any, of stationary-phase acid resistance;  measure pHint
              homeostasis and pH-dependent growth of acid-sensitive  strains; screen E. coli
              Tn10 and lac fusion strains for acid-  sensitivity, and map the loci;
              characterize stationary-phase  alkaline resistance in E. coli.  %%%  pH is a
              major environmental parameter for bacteria, and internal pH  is significant in
              terms of bacterial physiology and energy  transduction .  This research will
              lead to an understanding of how  bacteria can survive and function in extremely
              acidic environments.  ***
