Abstract    :
              The department of mathematical sciences at Worcester Polytechnic  Institute will
              purchase computer equipment which will be  dedicated to support research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The  equipment will be used for several research
              projects.  In  particular:  1) CFD and turbulence.  2) Clear Air turbulence. 
              3) The design of high performance parachutes. 4)  Multicriteria  Optimal Shape
              Design.
