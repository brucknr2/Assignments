Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This project represents a collaborative research                               
              effort between the University of Arizona (Drs. R.                              
              Emrick and  J. Vuillemin) and Cairo University                                 
              (Dr. M. Mostafa) in Egypt. The objective of this                               
              research is to study the magnetic properties of                                
              some novel magnetic insulators; these materials                                
              not only have interesting magnetic properties,                                 
              but also interesting electrical properties.  In                                
              addition to practical device applications, they                                
              can be used to verify theoretical predictions for                              
              systems of lower dimensionality.  The work will                                
              be conducted in the laboratory facilities at the                               
              University of Arizona and Dr. Mostafa will spend                               
              one year there.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This project in materials research fulfills the                                
              program objective of advancing scientific                                      
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                   
              United States and Egypt to combine complementary                               
              talents and conduct research in areas of strong                                
              mutual interest and competence.
