Abstract    :
              Koren         This research is on design tools which can compensate for 
              manufacturing yield losses due to the complexity of the logic.   Preliminary
              results have shown that yield can be enhanced by the  technique of reducing the
              sensitivity of the chip to point  defects.  Yield optimization algorithms and
              techniques which are  applicable to the last two stages of design - 
              topological/symbolic, and physical layout are being explored.   Physical layout
              strategies for yield enhancement in the channel  routing and compaction phases
              for standard cell designs are being  investigated.  Yield enhancements in
              topological designs are  being illustrated through PLA-based designs.
