Abstract    :
              9305922  Gaines  This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and 
              Organometallic Chemistry Division, will continue studies on the  fundamental
              chemistry of boron hydride cluster molecules and  their anions.  Specific
              objectives are the elucidation of  mechanisms of 1) skeletal rearrangements, 2)
              cluster  alkylations, 3) cluster growth reactions, and 4) reactions  leading to
              nitrogen group derivatives.  These studies will  utilize regiospecific isotopic
              labeling strategies, which will  require the development of new synthetic
              routes to some  compounds, and application of multinuclear NMR techniques.  %%%
               This research is concerned with the chemical reactivity  patterns of certain
              members of the family of compounds known as  boron hydrides.  The results of
              this research may ultimately  lead to new reagents for chemical synthesis, new
              routes to high  performance materials, and better agents for neutron capture 
              cancer therapy.  ***
