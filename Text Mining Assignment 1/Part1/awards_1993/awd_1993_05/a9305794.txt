Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Pennsylvania in the purchase of an x-ray diffractometer and                    
              associated data collection and analysis system and an upgrade                  
              of an older x-ray diffractometer.  This new instrument will                    
              enhance greatly research in a number of areas including the                    
              following:                                                                     
                                                                                             
              1)  Transition metal complexes of organosilicon compounds:  New                
              structures and catalysts,                                                      
              2)  Catalytic dehydrogenative coupling of alkylsilanes to                      
              carbosilanes,                                                                  
              3)  Natural product structure determination, synthesis and                     
              organic photochemistry:  Hitachimycin (a.k.a. Stubomycin), a                   
              novel antitumor agent,                                                         
              4) Bioorganic chemistry:  Non-peptidal peptidomimetics,                        
              5)  Materials chemistry and inorganic catalysis:  New polymeric                
              precursors to boron-based ceramics,                                            
              6)  Ferroelectric metal-oxo polymers and metal-insulator                       
              transitions in metal-oxo polymers,                                             
              7)  Organometallic reactivity of metallomacrocyclic complexes,                 
              8)  Strategies for synthesis of anti-tumor compounds.                          
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The x-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise                  
              measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a                      
              molecule.  The information obtained gives the precise values of                
              all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and                 
              it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of                 
              that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
