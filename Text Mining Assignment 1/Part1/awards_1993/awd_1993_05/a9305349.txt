Abstract    :
              9305349  Brandon       This award provides one-half the funds needed to acquire
              a  research optical microscope and a cathodoluminescence (CL) system  to be
              used in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at Yale  University. Yale
              University is committed to providing the remaining  funds needed for the
              acquisition.       The optical microscope and the CL system will be used 
              primarily in geological research projects where mineral textures  and
              compositions need to be studied in reflected, transmitted, and  induced
              fluorescent light.  ***
