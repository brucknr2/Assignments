Abstract    :
                   This award provides 64% of the funds required to purchase                 
              equipment items for the purpose of upgrading the cryogenic                     
              superconducting magnetometer operating in the Paleomagnetism and               
              Rock Magnetism Laboratory of the Department of Earth and Planetary             
              Sciences at the University of New Mexico. The institution is                   
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed for this                     
              equipment upgrade. The laboratory upgrade is needed primarily in               
              research using measurements of magnetism in rocks to gain a better             
              understanding of ancient tectonism and thermal conditions in the               
              crust.
