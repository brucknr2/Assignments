Abstract    :
              9305931  Real    This research project investigates the biological basis of
              decision-making.  All  people and other animals are faced with having to make
              choices about alternative  actions where the outcomes of their choices are not
              certain.  The dominant model  for human decision-making under uncertainty has
              recently been extended to  include aspects of human information-processing and
              cognition.  People often  misperceive the probabilities associated with
              alternative outcomes and, therefore,  appear to act "irrationally" in certain
              choice situations.  Dr. Real is exploring the  biological basis and ecological
              implications of animal information-processing under  uncertain choices and
              gambles.  He will carry out experiments to determine if  animals are similar to
              people in their perceptions of probabilities, and to  determine if the patterns
              of information-processing that generate misperception  can be explained as a
              result of the evolution of organisms for efficient use of  resources.
