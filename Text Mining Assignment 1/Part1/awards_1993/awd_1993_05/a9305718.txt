Abstract    :
              9305718  Bilham       This award provides one-half the funding required for the 
              purchase of new Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers that will  be used in
              a time-sharing mode by the Principal Investigator's  research group in the
              Cooperative Institute for Research in  Environmental Sciences at the University
              of Colorado and the  University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO) in Boulder,
              Colorado. The  University of Colorado is committed to providing the remaining 
              funds necessary for this acquisition.       The receivers will be used mainly
              in field research projects  aimed at detecting crustal motion and requiring
              accurate  determination of position by GPS (centimeter range over 100 
              kilometer baseline).   ***
