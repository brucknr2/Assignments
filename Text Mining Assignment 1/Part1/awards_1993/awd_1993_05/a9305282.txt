Abstract    :
              9305282  Lerner-Lam         This research is a continuation of a collaborative
              effort of  four universities to use the PASSCAL portable broad-band 
              seismometer array facility for a comprehensive imaging study of the  lateral
              transitions in mantle structure beneath the Rocky Mountain  Front.  Field work
              was completed under the first grant and this  will complete the analysis and
              synthesis of the data.  The Front  Range of the Colorado Rockies marks the
              eastern boundary of heavily  tectonized western North America and the western
              physiographic  boundary of the stable continental interior.  Earlier studies
              show  that their is a major lateral transition in seismic velocities  across
              the Front Range transition, but its details are poorly  understood. 
              Understanding this transition will provide constraints  on models of western
              U.S. dynamics and evolutionary models of the  North American craton.  ***
