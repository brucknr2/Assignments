              Abstract  ATM-9305750  Brenner, Mark  Title:  Paleoclimate of Southwest China:
              Development of the Asian  Monsoon    This award suports a study of sediment
              cores from four Yunnan lakes  which will be used to reconstruct the
              paleoclimate of southwest  China from late Pleistocene to present .  Long,
              14C-dated sections  (>10kyr BP) have been obtained.  Contrary to "predictions"
              from  general circulation models, pollen, diatom and geochemical data  indicate
              a shift from wet late Pleistocene to drier early Holocene  conditions.  The
              sediment record also suggests lake-level shifts  during the Holocene. 
              Chronologic resolution of paleoclimatic  records will be enhanced by
              close-interval sampling and AMS dating.   Stable isotope and trace metal ratios
              in sedimented ostracod shells  will be used to test previous paleoclimatic
              inferences and  establish whether late-Pleistocene, high lake levels were a 
              consequences of glacial meltwater input.  Paleoenvironmental  reconstruction
              will also be based on stable isotope signals in  carbonates and organic matter.
               Proxy paleoclimatic data from  southwest China will shed light on the
              development of the Asian  monsoon system and can be used to test moisture
              simulations from  general circulation models.
