Abstract    :
              9305166  Low  This proposal describes experiments that will examine the roles of
               DNA methylation patterns in regulating Escherichia coli gene  expression and
              physiology.  Although most of the 18,000 "GATC"  sites in the E. coli
              chromosome are methylated at the N-6 position  of adenine by the deoxyadenosine
              methylase (Dam), eleven  nonmethylated GATC sites (NM-GATC sites) have been
              identified and  cloned.  Two of these sites, NM-GATC 76 and NM-GATC77 located
              at 76  and  77 min on the E. coli chromosome respectively, require the 
              presence of leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) for  methylation
              protection.  Additional Lrp-dependent NM-GATC sites  have been identified and
              will be isolated by direct cloning from  CHEF gels.  The objective of this
              research are to identify and  characterize the genes controlled by
              Lrp-dependent NM-GATC sites  and to determine the roles of DNA methylation in
              regulating gene  expression in response to environmental stimuli and growth
              state.  %%%  These experiments will have a significant impact on our knowledge 
              regarding the mechanisms by which E. coli responds to environmental  stimuli
              and coordinates gene expression.  Methylation pattern  formation provides a
              mechanism by which multiple genes can be  controlled coordinately in response
              to environmental signals.   ***
