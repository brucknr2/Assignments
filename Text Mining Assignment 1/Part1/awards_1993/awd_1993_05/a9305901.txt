Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For 20 years, studies of microwear patterns on teeth of humans                 
              and other primates has promised to reveal new ways of discerning               
              dietary habits of those animals and also fossil ancestors, since               
              dental microwear patterns are recoverable.  However, because of                
              the complexities that researchers uncovered, this early promise                
              has gone largely unfulfilled.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project will be the first to study microwear patterns on                  
              teeth and relate those patterns to observed patterns of eating by              
              the particular animals concerned.  The physical traits (eg                     
              hardness) of the foods consumed will be established and related                
              to these and other findings.  This study will be of importance to              
              physical anthropology, animal behavior, and dentistry.
