Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland, College Park, will 
              purchase equipment and personnel to support research in the mathematical 
              sciences.  The equipment will be used to study:  (i) Systems of Conservation 
              Laws, Computational Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence,  (ii) Polyhedra in non- 
              Euclidean geometries.
