Abstract    :
              9305123  Kennedy    This U.S.-Hungary research project on "Living Carbocationic
              Copolymerization of Select  Olefins" is between Dr. Joseph P. Kennedy of the
              University of Akron and Dr. Tibor Kelen  of the Institute of Applied Chemistry,
              Kossuth University, Budapest.  The researchers intend  to synthesize, by living
              carbocationic copolymerization, three series of novel random  copolymers:
              isobutylene/styrene (IBu/St), isobutylene/indene (IBu/Ind), and styrene/indene 
              (St/Ind).  In the process, they will develop conditions to demonstrate living
              random  copolymerizations by kinetic experiments and then, describe the
              composition, molecular  weight and molecular weight distribution of their
              products.  Building upon their findings, Dr.  Kennedy and Dr. Kelen also will
              investigate compositional heterogeneity as a function of  molecular weight. 
              Once they feel they have optimized the syntheses of random living  IBu/ST,
              IBu/Ind copolymers, they will prepare sufficient quantities of promising
              copolymer  products for study of structure/property correlations.  Results
              should yield new insights of  importance in future engineering applications
              such as coatings and adhesives.    This project in materials research fulfills
              the program objectives of advancing science by  enabling leading experts in the
              U. S. and Hungary to combine complementary talents and  pool research resources
              in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
