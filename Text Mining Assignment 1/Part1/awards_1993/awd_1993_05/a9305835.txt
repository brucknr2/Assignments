Abstract    :
              Methods of  Markov chain Monte Carlo are attracting great                      
              interest in many areas of Statistics.  They provide                            
              realizations from probability distributions known only up to                   
              a normalizing constant, and thus from intractable                              
              probability distributions of latent variables conditional                      
              upon observed data.  These realizations can be used to                         
              obtain Monte Carlo approximants too therwise intractable                       
              likelihood functions and posterior probability                                 
              distributions.  The methods permit exploration of large and                    
              complex hypothesis spaces of models and parameters.                            
              Estimation of genealogical structure from genetic data is a                    
              long-standing problem, recently attracting renewed interest                    
              with the advent of new types of data that are potentially                      
              much more informative. The availability and quantity of such                   
              data are increasing rapidly.  The estimation of genealogies                    
              becomes of increasing practical importance with the                            
              increasing necessity to evaluate detailed population                           
              structure in the severely numerically restricted populations                   
              of  highly endangered species. The major problem in a                          
              coherent statistical analysis of genealogical structure lies                   
              in the plethora of alternative genealogical hypotheses that                    
              could relate a set of individuals. The development of the                      
              use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods towards the                            
              inference of genealogies and the estimation of population                      
              structure offers a solution of this complex problem. The                       
              current award will support research that is both                               
              methodological and computational.  Markov chain Monte                          
              CarloMethods are very flexible;  developing an effective                       
              method for a particular class of problems is not routine.                      
              Methods will be developed and evaluated.  Software to                          
              implement the methods will be developed, and will be applied                   
              in the context of some available data sets.  This award is                     
              being supported by four programs:  Statistics and                              
              Probability, Computational Mathematics, Systematics and
