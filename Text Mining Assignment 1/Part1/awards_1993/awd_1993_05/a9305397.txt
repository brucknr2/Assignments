Abstract    :
              Constructed Civil Infrastructure Systems (CCIS) is one of the                  
              largest components of the civil engineering construction business              
              in the United States.  Development and implementation of advanced              
              and innovative CCIS technologies are pivotal for maintaining the               
              competitiveness of U.S. design and construction industries.  In                
              particular, with a "United Western European Community (EC) "                   
              beginning in 1993, potential high-volume business opportunities are            
              emerging markets in previous Soviet Block Countries.  Thus, it is              
              important to identify CCIS state-of-the-art in Western Europe,                 
              forecast technology trends, and gain an understanding of the highly            
              effective R&D mechanisms being developed and used successfully by              
              western European countries for promoting and implementing                      
              innovation into practice in Western Europe.  ASCE's Civil                      
              Engineering Research Foundation (CERF) and the National Science                
              Foundation (NSF), in conjunction with the World Technology                     
              Evaluation Center (WTEC)/Japanese Technology Evaluation Center                 
              (JTEC), are organizing an International Task Force trip to selected            
              sites in Western European countries.  //
