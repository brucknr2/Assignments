Abstract    :
              9305573  The proposed research is to study efficient ways of applying maximum
              likelihood  (ML) inference to complex survey data.  The methodology we intend
              to apply is  based on the ideas of weighted distributions.  It consists of
              expressing the  joint probability density functions (pdf) for units in the
              sample as products of  the sample inclusion probabilities, expressed as
              functions of the observed data,  and the marginal pdf holding in the
              population.  These products are normalized.   ML estimators are obtained by
              maximazing the resulting weighted pdf with respect  to the unknown model
              parameters.  Survey data are often used in the social sciences and by
              government agencies to  estimate parameters of interest (e.g. cell frequencies;
              relationships among  variables).  Often the survey is complex in the sense that
              the chance that an  individual is in the sample depends on many factors.  As
              illustrated in the  statistical and econometric literature, failure to account
              for the features of  the sampling design in the inference process may yield
              misleading results.  The  significance of the proposed research is that it will
              hopefully provide a unified  approach for drawing inferences from complex
              survey data that will account for  the known features of the sampling design.
