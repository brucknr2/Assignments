Abstract    :
                  9305407  Hille    Gene expression is regulated by translational control in 
              oocytes  and eggs. Immature oocytes store inactive mRNAs, translational 
              initiation factors, and ribosomes, to be used during maturation of  the oocyte
              and during the early cleavage stages of embryogenesis.  On hormonal
              stimulation, immature oocytes undergo meiosis,  translational rates increase,
              and the translational specificity  switches from mRNAs that support growth to
              those that undergo rapid  cell divisions. In many animals, including mammals,
              frogs, and  starfish, meiosis and fertilization are coordinated with 
              fertilization occurring in meiosis II, after the first polar body  is extruded.
              Dr. Hille's previous research focused on elucidating  mechanisms that activate
              the translational apparatus during  maturation. She has shown that initiation
              factor eIF-4E is  phosphorylated 20 minutes after addition of the maturation
              hormone  to starfish oocytes, at the same time that the translation rate 
              increases. She now proposes to clone starfish eIF-4E so she can  determine the
              amino acid site that is phosphorylated. With the  cloned substrate in hand, she
              will move backward in the cascade of  meiotic events, searching for kinases
              that phosphorylate this  initiation factor. This search will have two prongs:
              purifying  starfish cytoplasm in collaboration with Dr. Steven Pelech and 
              testing for eIF-4E kinase activity, and trying to screen expression  libraries
              for a kinase that phosphorylates the starfish eIF-4E. The  cloning of the
              starfish eIF-4E kinase is of general interest since  the kinase responsible for
              phosphorylation of eIF-4E in vivo is not  known for any organism. This proposal
              is a prototype of a signal  transduction pathway that initiates growth and
              development of cells  and will increase our basic understanding of how
              translation is  activated through eIF-4E after environmental stimulation, and
              our  general understanding of hormone activation of animal oocytes.  ***
