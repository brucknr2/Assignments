Abstract    :
                      9305007  Dunn    Floral homeotic genes from Arabidopsis thaliana and
              Antirrhinum  majus have been shown to share considerable sequence similarity 
              with transcription factors from yeast (MCM1) and humans (SRF). all  of these
              putative transcription factors contain a highly conserved  DNA binding domain
              called the MADS box and are responsible for  transducing environmental signals
              influencing organ development. To  address the possibility that a member of
              this class of  transcriptional regulators may be active in alfalfa root nodule 
              development, degenerate oligonucleotides were designed to conserved  sequences
              flanking the MADS box domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana  ap3 homeotic gene.
              Preliminary data suggests that alfalfa root  nodules express a MADS box gene
              localized primarily in the infected  cells of the nodule. This factor is likely
              to play a role in both  receiving signals originating from the bacteria and in
              transmitting  the environmental cue to a cellular response. The first part of 
              this project characterizes the alfalfa MADS box gene and examines  its
              expression in several tissues. The second part of the project  addresses
              questions about the function of this gene. The alfalfa  MADS box domain will be
              inserted in place of the homologous region  of the MCM1 deletion. The target
              genes of the alfalfa MADS box  protein will be investigated by examining its
              specific binding to  nodule specific plant promoters. The information produced
              from this  study will be used to further examine the interaction of the MADS 
              box protein with both plant promoters as well as bacterial factors  required to
              bring about the desired symbiotic response.  ***
