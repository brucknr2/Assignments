Abstract    :
              9305271  Rich   This grant is focussed on increasing our understanding of RNA.  
              The major approach used in this work is x-ray diffraction studies  of single
              crystals of RNA components, as well as RNA binding  proteins.  X-ray
              diffraction studies allows one to determine the  three-dimensional structure of
              the molecule.  The major  experimental challenge in this work is to obtain
              crystals that  have suitable degrees of regularity, so that the analysis can be
               carried out to uncover fine details of molecular structure.  %%%  RNA plays a
              very important role in biological systems.  Not only  does it act to convey
              information from DNA that results in  directing the synthesis of proteins, but
              it also forms a number  of structural elements that form part of the machinery
              of the  cell.  The goal of this research is to crystallize segments of  RNA
              that contain various structural motifs.  These elements  determine the way that
              RNA folds upon itself or forms in a number  of different conformations.  RNA
              has recently been shown to have  enzymatic activity.  The structure of these
              "ribozymes" will also  be studied. In general, understanding the
              three-dimensional  structure of the RNA may lead to an enhanced awareness of
              how the  molecule functions in its biological context.  Knowing the  structure
              of proteins that bind to RNA and the manner in which  they specifically
              interact also enhances our understanding of its  role.  ***
