Abstract    :
              The proposed studies apply classical phage genetic approaches to               
              the screening of massive combinatorial primary structure libraries             
              related to the leucine zipper of yeast transcription factor GCN4.              
              The object of these studies is to define sequences which can form              
              heterodimers with wild type GCN4 leucine zippers, and to                       
              characterize primary sequence requirements for heterodimerization.             
              %%%                                                                            
              The roles of amino acid side chains in protein dimerization                    
              processes will be evaluated by altering the primary sequence                   
              randomly of a simple leucine zipper structural motif.  The                     
              functional significance of each new structure (there will be                   
              millions of such structures) will be screened, in a genetics based             
              system, in terms of ability to dimerize.  Two types of populations             
              will be sequenced: (1) those molecules which can form heterodimers             
              with the wild-type GCN4 leucine zipper, and (2) those molecules                
              which form stable homodimers, but not heterodimers (with the wild-             
              type leucine zipper).  Such studies will shed considerable insight             
              into the structural constraints involved in peptide-peptide,                   
              protein-protein interactions.
