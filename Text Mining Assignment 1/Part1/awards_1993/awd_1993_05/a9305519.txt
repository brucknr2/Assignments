Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Utah State                
              University will enhance the capabilities of an existing                        
              workstation system by purchasing a CPU upgrade, network co-                    
              processing board, network traffic software, larger disks, and                  
              peripheral video I/O equipment at an estimated cost of $53,014 to              
              allow researchers to better visualize the results of their work                
              by significantly increasing the performance of the existing                    
              system.  The equipment will be used for the following research                 
              projects.
