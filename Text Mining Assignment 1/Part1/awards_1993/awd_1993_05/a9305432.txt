Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are awarded to support the travel of speakers invited to the             
              52nd annual symposium of the Society for Developmental Biology                 
              (SDB), which will be held June 17-19, 1993 at Brown University,                
              Providence, RI and Woods Hole, Mass.  This year's symposium is                 
              organized by David McClay, current President of the SDB.  The title            
              of the meeting will be "Annual Meeting of the Society for                      
              Developmental Biology" with a broad range of topics selected for               
              the six platform sessions.  Topics will include "Gamete                        
              Morphogenesis, Fertilization and Egg Activation", "Cell                        
              Interactions", "Pattern Formation", "Transcriptional Regulation in             
              Development", "Axial Organization of the Embryo," and "New                     
              Approaches Being Applied in Model Developmental Systems".  Each                
              session will include several different animal and plant model                  
              systems in order to show the diverse mechanisms for solving a                  
              variety of developmental problems.  In addition, several                       
              minisymposia are being planned on plant developmental genetics.  In            
              the past five years the meeting has been of medium-size (300-400               
              registrants) with a single platform session (about 30 speakers                 
              total) and 60-80 posters presented at two sessions.  This year, the            
              last day of the meeting will be held at Woods Hole, a short                    
              distance from Providence, RI.  The symposium on the last day will              
              celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Woods Hole Embryology                   
              Course, a course that has had a strong role in the training of                 
              developmental biologists in the United States and around the world.            
              The meeting is attended by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,            
              and senior researchers.
