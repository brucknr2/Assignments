Abstract    :
              The primary goals of this proposal are:  1) to determine the                   
              formation conditions of a Carlin-type gold deposit, and 2)                     
              to either link or separate in time the Getchell gold system                    
              and an adjacent 90 Ma granodiorite intrusion and related                       
              mineralization.  These goals will be accomplished by 1) a                      
              detailed petrographic and fluid inclusion study of the gold                    
              system to constrain formation pressures and temperature and                    
              aqueous fluid chemistry, and 2) a detailed petrographic and                    
              fluid inclusion study of quartz veins and tungsten skarn                       
              mineralization related to the granodiorite intrusion, to                       
              obtain similar constraints.  Fluid inclusions will be                          
              evaluated by microthermometry and microanalyses including                      
              Raman spectroscopy, quadrupole mass spectrometry, and ion                      
              chromatography.  The Getchell system provides a unique                         
              opportunity to examine, in detail, the physical/chemical                       
              evolution of a Carlin-type deposit.  Preliminary results                       
              demonstrate that fluid inclusions present are suitable for                     
              microthermometry, Raman spectroscopy, and quadrupole mass                      
              spectrometry.  This study will document the                                    
              physical/chemical conditions conducive to gold precipitation                   
              and the relationship between gold mineralization and igneous                   
              activity in Carlin-type systems.  Results will link or                         
              separate in time the gold- and intrusion-related                               
              mineralization and may place important constraints on the                      
              age of gold mineralization in a Carlin-type deposit.
