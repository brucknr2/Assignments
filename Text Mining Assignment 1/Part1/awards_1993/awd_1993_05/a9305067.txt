Abstract    :
              Wolfson  The research entails the study of minimal surfaces in Kaehler- 
              Einstein manifolds.  Of particular interest are those of the  stable kind where
              the second variation of the energy of the map  is positive definite.  It
              intended to show that there exist  stable minimal surfaces in Ricci-flat K3
              surafces which are non-  holomorphic for any compatible complex structure. 
              This research  may have applications to other areas of mathematics such as 
              algebraic geometry as well as to some branches of modern  mathematical physics.
