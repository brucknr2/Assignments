Abstract    :
              9305219  Jeanloz      This award supports a 2-year collaborative research
              program  intended to elucidate the elastic properties of majorite, the 
              garnet-structured high-pressure phase of pyroxene that is an  important
              constituent of the transition zone in the Earth's  mantle.  The study would
              check previous measurements that are  controversial, resolving whether or not
              the properties of  majorite are anomalously sensitive to details of
              composition,  crystallographic structure, ordering or origin.  Resolving this 
              issue is critical to understanding the geophysical properties of  the mantle
              transition zone.  The work would also provide a  significant cross-check
              between two laboratories and between two  methods of determining elastic
              properties on polycrystalline  aggregates, Brillouin spectroscopy and static
              compression.  For  the first time, natural samples of transition-zone
              high-pressure  phases would be made available to the community for
              complementary  studies through modern techniques of chemical and physical
              micro-  analysis.  ***
