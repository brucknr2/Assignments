Abstract    :
              9305728  Kuzyk  This proposal seeks partial funding for an international
              conference  on the topic of organic nonlinear optics with meeting headquarters 
              at Val Thorens, France.  NSF funds are requested for travel support  of U.S.
              invited speakers and Ph.D. students.  The purpose of the  meeting is to bring
              together top researchers-whose expertise spans  material design, material
              characterization, device fabrication, and  integrated device architectures-to
              the intimate setting of a small  mountain town to discuss and assess progress
              in the field.  This  upcoming conference is motivated by a small NSF-supported 
              conference that was held in Pullman, Washington in the summer of  1992.  At the
              demand of workers in the field who feel that such a  small forum is lacking, a
              future series of such conferences are  planned in 18 to 24 month intervals and
              will be held in those  countries that are active in this field.  ***
