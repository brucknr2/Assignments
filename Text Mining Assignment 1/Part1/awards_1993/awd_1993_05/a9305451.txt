Abstract    :
              9305451  Karato       This award provides partial funding for the upgrade of the
               high-pressure rock deformation laboratory in the Department of  Geology and
              Geophysics at the University of Minnesota. The funds  are to be used to
              construct equipment for triaxial deformation  studies under conditions of up to
              2 GPa and 1700K (a so-called  Griggs apparatus) and a piston-cylinder unit for
              studies up to 6  GPa and 2500K. The University of Minnesota is committed to 
              providing the remaining funds needed for this equipment  construction project. 
                   Specific research topics that will be carried out with the new  facilities
              include the rheological properties of minerals at high  temperature and
              pressure, the solubility and diffusivity of water  in minerals and its effect
              on physical properties, the partitioning  of elements between silicates and
              iron alloys, the wetting  relationships between molten iron alloys and solid
              silicates, and  the kinetics of microstructure developments in minerals found
              in  ultradeep xenoliths. All of these studies bear significantly on 
              understanding the structure and evolution of the Earth's dynamic  interior.
