Abstract    :
              9305331  Dantzig  This research concerns stochastic  programming techniques, in 
              particular the combination of  importance sampling and Bender's  decomposition.
               It is becoming  possible to solve really large  practical models.  Problems 
              analyzed so far include the  important class of two stage  stochastic linear
              programs with  some extensions to the multistate  case.  ***
