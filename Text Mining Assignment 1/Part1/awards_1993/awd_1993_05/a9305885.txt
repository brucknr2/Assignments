Abstract    :
                   A coordinated and integrated management of the Manufacturing              
              Logistics function is essential for the success of any                         
              manufacturing enterprise.  Manufacturing Logistics (ML) is defined             
              as that part of a business enterprise engaged in the planning and              
              control of inventory and production.  The activities of                        
              manufacturing logistics range from aggregate production planning               
              to detailed shop floor scheduling and control and include the                  
              typical materials management functions of inventory planning,                  
              production planning and scheduling, purchasing, and material                   
              control.  These manufacturing management functions interact with               
              each other and hence proper coordination between them is critical.             
              The practice of Manufacturing Logistics management is in dire need             
              of improvement.  In spite of major advances in technology,                     
              inventory turns (a measure of ML performance) for US manufacturers             
              has seen no significant improvement over the last four decades.                
              While the practice of ML continues, the research effort in ML is               
              conducted largely by the academic community.                                   
                   This workshop will address three dichotomies among the ML                 
              researchers and practitioners.  These are:  (1) academic versus                
              industry points of view, (2) engineering versus business point of              
              view, (3) operations research versus information systems point of              
              view.  If major advances in the practice of ML are to take place               
              then a long run and coherent point of view will be needed with an              
              eye toward focussing research talent/efforts to the best advantage.
