Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The NSF-owned Research Vessel OCEANUS, operated under a charter                
              party agreement by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, has               
              operated continuously for 17 years.  The average projected life                
              of a research vessel is 30 years.  This project will make major                
              modifications and upgrades to the vessel to prepare her for the                
              second half of her operational life.                                           
                                                                                             
              The viability of an oceanographic research vessel to conduct the               
              changing needs of ocean science research diminishes with time.                 
              The modifications and upgrades will modernize the OCEANUS and                  
              equip her to be as effective and reliable as when she was                      
              originally delivered for service in 1975.                                      
                                                                                             
              The improvements focus on three major areas.  Improvements to                  
              increase and enhance the ability of the ship to conduct ocean                  
              science research; upgrades to improve the day to day operation                 
              and maintainability of the ship; and refinements to improve the                
              habitability of the ship.  Attention to all these areas will                   
              result in a vessel well equipped to continue a long standing                   
              tradition of good service to the community of ocean science                    
              research.
