Abstract    :
                   In April 1992, a team consisting of David Applegate of                    
              AT&T Bell Laboratories, Robert Bixby of Rice University, Vasek                 
              Chvatal of Rutgers University, and William Cook of Bellcore                    
              established a new world record by solving ten previously                       
              unsolved problems, with sizes ranging from 1,060 to 3,038                      
              cities, from a standard library of test data called TSPLib.                    
              (In particular, the 3,038-city problem is the largest TSPLib                   
              instance ever solved.)  The task of writing up an exposition                   
              of the new algorithm is overwhelming: the program, developed                   
              by four people in the course of four years has some 50                         
              thousand lines not counting the part that implements the                       
              simplex method.  The award is so that Chvatal can buy himself                  
              out of his teaching duties at Rutgers for the Spring term of                   
              1993 in order to dedicate himself full-time to writing in                      
              constant consultations with his colleagues at AT&T Bell Labs                   
              in Murray Hills, NJ and Bellcore in Morristown, NJ.
