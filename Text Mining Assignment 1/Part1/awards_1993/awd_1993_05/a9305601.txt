Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with inference for longitudinal                
              data, such as of survival analysis and time series type.  Tests                
              and confidence intervals in such problems are typically based on               
              the asymptotic behavior of martingales.  This project will focus               
              on more accurate ways of setting critical points in such                       
              inference.  One approach to this problem is to transform the                   
              martingales to create statistics more accurately approximated by               
              the asymptotic distribution.  Another approach is to look for                  
              better approximations to the law of the martingale, via Edgeworth              
              or saddlepoint expansions, or bootstrapping.                                   
                   The research is intended to improve the way statisticians                 
              interpret data from processes that evolve over time.  Main cases               
              are (1) long term medical data, where patients are followed over               
              a period of time, and (2) economic data.  These quite different                
              types of settings can be studied with a relatively unified                     
              technology, which relates to the theory of fair games.                         
              Substantial gains in how data are interpreted can be obtained by               
              further exploiting this connection.
