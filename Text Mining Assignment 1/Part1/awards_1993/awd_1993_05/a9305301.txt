Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds required for the                   
              acquisition of an atomic absorption spectrometer and an ion                    
              chromatograph unit that will be installed and operated in the                  
              Department of Geology and Geological Engineering at the University             
              of Idaho. The University is committed to providing the remaining               
              funds that will be needed for the acquisition.                                 
                   The instruments will be used primarily in the research and                
              teaching programs of the Principal Investigator and colleagues that            
              require chemical analyses of major and trace elements in natural               
              water and rock samples. The equipment will also be open to other               
              researchers on campus as well as regional users from nearby                    
              research institutions.
