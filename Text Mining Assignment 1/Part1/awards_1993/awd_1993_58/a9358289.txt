Abstract    :
              9358289  Kovacs  This NYI award will support two projects.  The first project is
              the continued development of a micromachined heavy metal ion sensor for
              detecting contamination in groundwater.  This work should have considerable
              impact in the monitoring of drinking water and process chemicals, as well as
              providing "early warning" signals to prevent irreversible environmental damage.
               Preliminary work has shown sensitivities as high as one part per billion, but
              considerable work remains to be done to improve the capabilities of the devices
              and to integrate control circuitry.  The second project is the development of
              process technology for implantable, micromachined neural prostheses.  Using
              preliminary devices, neural signals have been recorded at extended periods
              after implantation in mammalian and amphibian nerves.  Further work would allow
              the designs to be refined, and amplifier circuits to be incorporated into the
              implants themselves.  The ultimate goals of this work are to provide a direct
              interface between an amputee's limb stump and a prosthesis, and to provide a
              new tool for the study of signal encoding in peripheral nerves.  ***
