Abstract    :
              9358351  Liu  The initial research project is to characterize harmonics in power
               systems by developing an integrated probabilistic harmonic flow  algorithm
              that considers the nonlinear dependency of harmonic  voltages and currents, and
              random variations of operation modes and  switching status of nonlinear loads. 
              An additional topic is to  develop intelligent diagnostic methodologies to
              detect incipient  failures and assess the remaining life of power equipment
              using  adaptive pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural  networks.
               Finally an effort will be made to develop and simulate  different out-of-step
              relaying algorithms to be implemented at the  Florida and Georgia interface for
              real time tie-line operation  control upon the detection of potentially
              unstable conditions.  The  accurate representation of the different sections of
              a power system  is a critical issue in achieving such a goal.  This study will 
              continue to look for an optimum equivalence strategy tailored for  system
              out-of-step identification.   ***
