Abstract    :
              9358284  Sanders  Future advances in the power electronics field are likely to
              come  from two directions: theoretical understanding and technological 
              application.  This research combines these disciplines, research  on analysis,
              modeling, control, and simulation of power  electronic systems is proposed. 
              Increasingly complex power  electronic systems are being designed, and
              simulation is emerging  as an essential design step for these systems.  To
              address these  simulation challenges, novel techniques including parallel 
              computation, multi-parameter homotopy, and others are to be  explored.    Novel
              approaches for building the next generations of power  supplies are also
              proposed.  The proposed power supply  technologies offer very high power
              density, high efficiency, and  simplified manufacturing processes.  With the
              current trends of  miniaturization and portability of electronic equipment, the
              need  for integrated power supply systems is critical.  To this date,  there
              has been no successful design of an integrated power supply  that handles a
              significant power level.  One of the reasons for  this is the difficulty in
              building integrated magnetic  components.  New approaches for fabrication of
              integrated  magnetic devices are to be pursued.   ***
