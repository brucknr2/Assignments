Abstract    :
              9358268  Martin  This is a National Science  Foundation Young Investigator award
               to support research to be performed  by the Principal Investigator who  was
              selected through procedures  contained in NSF 92-116, Young  Investigator
              Awards FY93 Program.   The PI will perform research to  develop a simplified
              method of  predicting lateral movements in  liquefied sands using laboratory
              and  in-situ test data and case  histories.  The case histories will  involve
              sites where lateral  movements in liquefied sands were  measured following
              earthquake  shaking.  This research will help in  a more accurate estimation of
              the  damage potential of sites and built  facilities due to liquefaction 
              caused by earthquakes for a better  land use planning.  ***
