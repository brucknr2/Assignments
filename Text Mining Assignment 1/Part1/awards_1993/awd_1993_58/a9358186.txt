Abstract    :
              9358186  Engelhardt  This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
              award to  support research to be performed by the Principal Investigator  who
              was selected through procedures contained in NSF 92-116,  Young Investigator
              Awards FY93 Program.  The PI will perform  research in two areas: (1)
              Development of an improved moment  connection for seismic-resistant steel
              framing.  This work will  address a serious deficiency in U.S. seismic practice
              and codes.  (2) Development of basic experimental and behavioral data on 
              explosive powered fastening for application in the repair and  strengthening of
              existing steel structures.  ***
