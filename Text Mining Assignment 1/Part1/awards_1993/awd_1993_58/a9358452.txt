Abstract    :
              9358452  Curtis                              This award will focus on the
              scale-up of chemical  production from plant tissue cultures.  The potential  of
              plant tissue cultures as sources of biologically  active chemicals is
              exemplified by taxol, an  anti-cancer drug recently approved by the FDA for 
              treatment of ovarian cancer.  Taxol is isolated from  the bark of the Pacific
              yew tree.  The yields from this  tree are relatively low and several trees are
              required  to treat a single patient.  The tree is also slow  growing, ie., it
              requires 100 years to mature, and has  a very limited area of distribution. 
              Plant cell  cultures may provide an alternative for the production  of taxol as
              well as other plant derived products, and  thus provide a means of overcoming
              limitations in  natural resources.  ***
