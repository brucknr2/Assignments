Abstract    :
              9358209  Davis  This is an award to support  research through a National Science
               Foundation Young Investigator Award  to be performed by the Principal 
              Investigator who was nominated and  selected through procedures  contained in
              NSF 92-116, Young  Investigator Awards FY 1993  Program.  This investigator's 
              research plan includes an  investigation of the use of  photocatalytic
              oxidation processes  to destroy contaminants of water  that are recalcitrant to
                destruction by use of conventional  processes.    The contaminants of water
              this  investigator plans to work on  include organic-complexed metals, 
              pesticides and residues from  production of dyestuffs and  explosives. 
              Successful application  of photocatalytic oxidation toward  their oxidation may
              provide an  efficient, low-cost/maintenance  process for engineering design of 
              systems to decontaminate water  containing these substances.
