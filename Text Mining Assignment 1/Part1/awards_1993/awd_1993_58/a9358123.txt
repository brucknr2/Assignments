Abstract    :
              9358123 Maniatty          The purpose of this research is to develop numerical
              tools to analyze common forming process used in manufacturing in order to
              better predict material behavior during and subsequent to these operations. 
              Specific processes of interest include rolling, drawing, and extrusion.  In
              such processes, where the material undergoes large deformations, the properties
              of the material change as the deformation proceeds.  For example,
              polycrystalline metals exhibit both strain hardening and induced anisotropy as
              they are deformed.  In addition, after the deformation process is complete, the
              workpiece still retains residual stresses.  The behavior of metals is
              determined by microstructural phenomena, therefore, using micromechanics as a
              basis can lead to a model which more accurately characterizes the material
              behavior.          It would be of value to many industries to be able to
              predict, via inexpensive numerical simulations, both the material properties
              and the residual stresses resulting from a given deformation process under
              given conditions, as these characteristics are directly related to the quality
              of the product.  In the past, these processes could not be accurately analyzed
              due to the inherent complexity.  Now with the increasing power and capabilities
              of computers, numerical analysis of these process is becoming a reality.  Such
              capabilities would enable a manufacturer to investigate, at low cost, the
              effect on the quality of their product of certain changes in their forming
              process before actually implementing the changes.  In addition, it could also
              be used as a tool to aid in the design of new processes.
