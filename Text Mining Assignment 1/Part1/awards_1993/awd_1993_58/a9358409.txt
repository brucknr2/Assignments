Abstract    :
              9358409  Bonnecaze    Fundamental mechanisms and phenomea of transport and
              mixing of  dense particulate flow will investigated using tomographic  imaging,
              advanced micromechanical models and numerical  simulations.    His research on
              two-phase flow materials with random  microstructure has applciations to
              electrorheological fluids,  multiphase processes and materials production.  ***
