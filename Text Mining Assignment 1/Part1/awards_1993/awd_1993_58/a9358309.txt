Abstract    :
              ECS9358309  Zhu  The Principal Investigators research focuses on the magnetic
              aspects of future ultra-high capacity magnetic data storage systems.  Combining
              supercomputer aided micromagnetic simulation studies with experimental
              fabrication techniques, they are developing magnetic thin film media with
              advanced microstructures which are capable of storing data at densities of two
              order of magnitude higher than that in current high-end hard disk drives.  The
              P.I.s have developed a technique which uses a magnetic force microscope as a
              micromagnetometer with superior magnetic sensitivity to directly measure
              magnetic switching properties of a single nano-scale magnetic particle for the
              first time in this field.  They are using this new technique to study
              ultra-fine magnetic particles for developing the medium in future Tera-Byte
              magnetic data cartridge.  ***
