Abstract    :
              9358288  Rotea  As in other areas of engineering, design of control systems 
              involves tradeoffs among competing objectives.  The basic problem  is to find a
              controller that optimizes several competing  performance and robustness
              requirements associated with one  dynamical system.  Good tracking of reference
              inputs vs low  sensitivity to sensor noise, robust stability vs performance,
              are  just a few examples of these tradeoffs.  Clearly, it is important  to
              develop tools to help the designer understand how the various  competing
              objectives conflict with each other.  One goal of this  research is to obtain
              design procedures for the synthesis of  controllers that meet several design
              specifications in the  presence of uncertainty in the plant description.     
              It is intuitively obvious that the performance of a given system  may be
              greatly improved if the plant to be controlled and the  controller are designed
              simultaneously rather than designing the  plant first and then the controller. 
              Unfortunately, in some  cases of engineering relevance, an integrated
              plant/controller  design is not feasible due to the large number of variables
              and  design objectives.  However, there are some challenging aerospace 
              problems for which such an integration is not only feasible but  also
              desirable.  Another goal of this research is to develop a  methodology for the
              design of systems (i.e. both plant and  controller are to be designed) that
              satisfy multiple design  specifications of practical significance.      This
              research has three main components: (1) the development of  new theoretical
              results for the analysis and synthesis of robust  feedback systems with
              multiple design specifications, (2) the  development of computational efficient
              algorithms to implement  the theory, and (3) applications to validate the
              results.  ***
