Abstract    :
              9358093  Gao  This National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award is 
              concerned with the development of a combined theoretical and  experimental,
              multidisciplinary, research program on micromechanics  of advanced materials
              systems.  These include: (1) heteroepitaxial  thin films in various
              microelectronic, magnetic and optical  devices; (2) fracture mechanics of
              advanced composites; and (3)  earthquake fault systems.
