Abstract    :
              9358406  DePablo    The project focuses on developing a theoretical
              understanding  of the structure and equilibrium thermodynamic properties of 
              complex fluids.  The transport properties and non-equilibrium  behavior is also
              explored theoretically.  An experimental  component aimed at validating the
              results of the theoretical  work is also included in the project.  The complex
              fluids  include polymer melts and polymer solutions, especially in  confined
              geometrics such as in porous media or as in model  biological membranes.  In
              the theoretical investigations,  efforts will be made to develop further
              improvements in pair  distribution functions for the highly asymmetric mixtures
              of  polymeric fluids.  Efforts are underway to ameliorate existing 
              integral-equation methods for polymers.  The project also  involves studies to
              develop stochastic methods to mimic the  motion of flexible molecules as they
              travel through dense  media, e.g. dense polymers, underground reservoirs. 
              Another  line of investigation deals with cryopreservation of food,  plants,
              and pharmaceuticals through addition of small amounts  of cryoprotectants (e.g.
              disaccharides or polymeric molecules)  in dilute electrolyte solutions.  ***
