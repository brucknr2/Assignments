Abstract    :
              9358344  Holloway  The work carried out under this NYI  research award is
              directed to  improving our capabilities in  modeling plasmas that are either 
              collisionless or dominated by  charged particle-neutral particle  collisions,
              such as non-neutral  plasmas in high power systems and  in electrostatic traps,
              or  processing plasmas.  The algorithms  being explored are based on the use 
              of pseudospectral collocation for  the spatial and velocity  discretization of
              the kinetic  equations and Maxwell's equations,  with the discretization
              carried out  so that much of the Hamiltonian  structure of the exact system is 
              preserved in the collisionless  limit.  The resulting semi-discrete  systems
              can be made to exactly  preserve the Hamiltonian of the  original system, as
              well as some of  its Casimirs, such as number of  particles and square integral
              of  the charged particle distribution  function; methods tat exactly  conserve
              momentum at finite grid  size are also being sought.  Time  discretization
              methods that exactly  preserve these important physical  quantities at finite
              numerical grid  size are used; these methods  include explicit and nonlinearly 
              implicit methods.  The modeling of  systems with phenomena occurring  over very
              disparate time scales  (such as in processing plasmas) is  being studied by a
              combination of   asymptotic methods (multiple time  scale analysis)  and
              spectral  methods.  ***
