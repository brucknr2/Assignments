Abstract    :
              9358367  Crook  The research performed with this NSF Young Investigator Award
              involves growth by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of novel semiconductor
              structures for electronic and photonic device applications.  One current
              research program examines the synthesis and properties of interfaces,
              superlattices, and alloys formed by combing elemental and III-V compound
              semiconductors.  The Young Investigators Award will enhance this program by
              providing funding for additional experiments to examine the properties of novel
              materials such as (GaAs)1-x(Si2)x alloys and GaAs/Si short-period superlatties.
               A research program in planar devices formed by patterning of two-dimensional
              electron gas structures grown by MBE will be initiated during the period of the
              award.  Interaction with industry will be pursed for research in these areas,
              as well as on related topics such as reproducible growth conditions for MBE.  A
              course on compound semiconductor devices will be developed and first taught in
              the Fall of 1993, and other new courses will be developed in subsequent years.
