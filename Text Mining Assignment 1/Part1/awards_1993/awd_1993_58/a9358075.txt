Abstract    :
              The research activity of this project is the reliability of                    
              structural components and systems in order to predict the degree               
              of safety of the total structure.  The study of the reliability                
              of connections for steel structures is the first case study.                   
              Algorithms will be developed which combine connector reliability               
              and structural analysis with Monte-Carlo simulation, Fault Tree                
              analysis, and First-Order Second-Moment reliability methods.                   
              Research results on reliability of structures and components are               
              brought into the classroom to relate design to safety.
