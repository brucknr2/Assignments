Abstract    :
                9358236  Diamond  This award will focus on the metabolic and  genetic response
              of mammalian cells to  physical forces such as those encountered in 
              bioreactors.  The work is directed at  elucidating molecular level events which
               control mechano-biological coupling.  With  this understanding, changes in
              environmental  factors will be tested to help eliminate  mammalian
              sensitivities to externally applied  forces.
