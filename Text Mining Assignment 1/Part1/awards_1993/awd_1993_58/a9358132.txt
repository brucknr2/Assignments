Abstract    :
              9358132   Tortorelli        This program implements analytical optimization
              capabilities  for the design of nonlinear systems, specifically those
              encountered  in manufacturing processes and product design.  Ultimately these 
              capabilities will be combined to create an environment suitable   for the
              concurrent design of both the product and its manufacturing  process.  It will
              unite the disciplines of applied mechanics,   numerical methods, manufacturing
              design, numerical programming,   and product design.  The primary contribution
              to this unification  is the derivation and efficient computation of design
              sensitivity  expressions.        Currently, many excellent analysis
              capabilities exist to   evaluate the performance of products and their
              manufacturing   processes.  For example, given a design, an engineer performs a
                finite element analysis to determine if the design is acceptable  or
              unacceptable.  Two questions then arise. (1) if the design is  acceptable, how
              I can I improve it? and (2) If the design is   unacceptable, how can I make it
              acceptable?  Design sensitivity   analysis  and numerical optimization address
              both of these   questions.
