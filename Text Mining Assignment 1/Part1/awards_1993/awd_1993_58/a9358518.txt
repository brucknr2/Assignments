Abstract    :
              9358518  Ramirez    The focus of the research is to develop new knowledge and
              methods  in the area of engineering design for the purposes of effective 
              teaching and real-world application that will facilitate the  development of
              engineering judgment and design vision for new  engineers as well as
              established engineers facing new technologies.   Results from the fields of
              educational psychology and cognitive  science will be integrated and developed
              into a cohesive framework  for teaching/learning which will be
              motivationally-based, student  centered, and vectored towards structured
              experiential learning for  the development of engineering judgment.  The role
              of spatial and  functional visualization in scientific creativity will be 
              investigated.  New knowledge structures and methods will be  developed to cope
              with the intrinsic characteristics of engineering  design as well as for the
              accomplishment of the goal of innovation.  ***
