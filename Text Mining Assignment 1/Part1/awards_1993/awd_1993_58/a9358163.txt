Abstract    :
              9358163  May       The research involves applying implementation of computer- 
              integrated manufacturing (IC-CIM) techniques to two critical  fabrication
              processes used in the production of high performance  multichip modules and
              other integrated circuits: plasma-enhanced  chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)
              and reactive ion etching (RIE).   These precesses are used in the process
              sequence to deposit and  etch silicon dioxide dielectric layers.  Several
              aspects of  computer-integrated manufacturing successfully applied to other 
              etching and deposition processes.  For these applications,  traditional
              statistically-based approaches to process modeling,  control and diagnosis
              represent the predominant methods to achieve  IC-CIM objectives.  However, more
              recent efforts have shown that  neural networks offer great promise in process
              modeling.  In fact,  neural process models have been shown to be both more
              accurate and  more robust than their statistical counterparts.  This is due to 
              the high degree of parallelism and connectivity in these networks,  which
              crudely mimics the architecture of the human brian.       It is anticipated
              that the innovative use of neural networks  will also have a significant impact
              in process monitoring, control,  and equipment diagnosis as well.  This program
              of research will  investigate and implement several novel neural network based 
              approaches to the monitoring, modeling, control, and diagnosis of  RIE and
              PECVD.  These techniques will be applied specifically to  a high performance
              multichip module program, but the methodology  developed will be generic and
              readily applicable to other  electronics manufacturing processes and equipment.
