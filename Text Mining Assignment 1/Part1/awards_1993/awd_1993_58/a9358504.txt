Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT --- CTS-9358504  FLIK    The PI will attempt to solve thermal problems
              crucial for the development of electronics and opto-electronics technology.
              This will be accomplished by studying heat transfer in micro structures and
              novel materials. Attempts will be made to develop fundamental new experimental
              techniques in microscale heat transfer, e.g., for the measurement of
              temperature fields in the tens of nanometers, the measurement of thermal
              conductivity of thin films and radiative properties for thin films and small
              molecular clusters. Theoretical methods to predict these properties will also
              be pursued.
