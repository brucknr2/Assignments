Abstract    :
              The research plan focuses on incorporating fundamental knowledge               
              in micromechanics of granular media  acquired through basic                    
              research into new or improved engineering solutions and design                 
              methodologies. The plan involves the study of the arching mechanism            
              of load transfer in discrete materials. This mechanism can take                
              place within a large field or on interaction with a solid body.                
              Once understood and analyzed, the formulation of this mechanism can            
              assist in solving numerous engineering problems of granular                    
              material/structure interaction where empirical and/or simplified               
              solutions are currently employed.
