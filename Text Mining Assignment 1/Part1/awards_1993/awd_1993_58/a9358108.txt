Abstract    :
              An NYI award will support research on the deposition and                       
              properties of thin films for tribological applications.  Ion                   
              enhanced physical vapor deposition using unbalanced magnetrons to              
              improve plasma confinement will be used to deposit hard coatings,              
              such as various metal nitride, carbide and oxide compositions, as              
              well as superlattice and nanophase materials.  Deposition                      
              mechanisms will be studied and the mechanical, tribological and                
              other relevant properties of the coatings will be evaluated and                
              related to microstructure and processing parameters.
