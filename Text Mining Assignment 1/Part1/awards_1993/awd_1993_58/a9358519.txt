Abstract    :
              9358519  Resnick    During the past decade, there has been a surge of scientific
               interest in how complex phenomena can arise from simple  components and simple
              interactions.  The study of complex systems  raises not only scientific
              questions, but also educational and  epistemological questions:  Must people
              develop new ways of  thinking in order to make sense of complex phenomena?  And
              if so,  what types of tools and activities can engage students in  thinking
              about complex systems in new ways?    I propose to develop a set of new
              computational tools to enable  pre-college students to construct and explore
              complex phenomena.   I plan to focus particularly on ideas related to
              evolution.   Previous studies have shown that many students misunderstand and 
              resist the idea of evolution through natural selection.  I plan  to develop a
              set of "evolution tools" (based on computational  techniques like genetic
              algorithms) with the dual goals of:  (a)  gaining a deeper understanding of
              students' misconceptions about  evolutionary ideas, and (b) helping students
              develop new ways to  think about evolution.  ***
