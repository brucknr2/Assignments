Abstract    :
              9358419  Rutland    A program is being developed to study turbulent reacting
              flows  using direct numerical simulation (DNS) techniques coupled with 
              kinetics.  DNS will be used to understand the basic physical  processes in
              turbulent flames and to develop models from this.  A  building block approach
              will be used.  The focus of the effort will  be on DNS results, not development
              of codes.  Existing codes will  be used.  Some specific techniques and
              assumptions are:       (1)  variable density flow with heat release; low Mach
              number            no sound waves;       (2)  use of spectral methods and high
              order compact finite            difference methods;       (3)  use simple
              single step and reduced multi-step chemistry.  ***
