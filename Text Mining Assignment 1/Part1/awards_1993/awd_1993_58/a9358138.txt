Abstract    :
              9358138  Ziegert       This research project will consider the dual problems of 
              accuracy assessment and accuracy enhancement.  In principle, if the 
              positioning errors at each location in the workspace of the machine  are known
              in advance, they can be corrected in software.  To  accomplish this, the causes
              of the errors must be isolated and  studied.  These error sources include
              manufacturing tolerances of  the machine slides, deformations caused by heat,
              and deflections  due to gravity.       Software based error correction offers a
              large potential  economic payback.  Commodity grade machine tools may be able
              to  achieve substantially higher accuracy levels at a very modest cost,  thus
              making them competitive with more expensive machines  specifically designed for
              high precision work.  Successful  completion of this research project may help
              the US machine tool  companies to regain a competitive advantage.
