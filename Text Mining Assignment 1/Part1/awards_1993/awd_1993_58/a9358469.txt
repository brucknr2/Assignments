Abstract    :
              9358469  McKinley    Funded from a National Science Foundation Young
              Investigator  Award, research in Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics will be 
              conducted. The approach is experimental, through the use of  integrated
              applications of Laser Doppler Velocimetry and  Digital Particle Image
              Velocimetry. Various fluid dynamic  issues related to instabilities in the flow
              of polymers and  suspensions will be explored.    Polymer processes such as
              extrusion, spinning, and coating are  subject to various forms of
              instabilities, and a more accurate  and realistic basis is needed to predict
              and control stable  performance of these systems.   ***
