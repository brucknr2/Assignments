Abstract    :
              9358517  Philipp    knowledge for teaching has been an area of much research in
              the  past decade.  Today some of the domains of knowledge identified  include
              knowledge of subject matter, pedagogical content  knowledge, knowledge of the
              curriculum, and knowledge of  learners.  Research has shown that experimental
              teachers who have  had access to research about students' thinking within well-
               defined mathematical content domains listen to children explain  their mental
              processes used when solving problems and accept a  larger variety of strategies
              than control teachers.  These  experimental teachers also spend less time
              during class on drill  activities and more time on problem solving.  The
              research  extending this work to preservice teachers is just emerging, and  one
              area that has not yet been investigated is the relationship  between teachers'
              content knowledge, pedagogical content  knowledge, conceptions of mathematics,
              and understanding of  students' mathematical thinking.  This project will
              research the  relationship between preservice teachers' mathematics content 
              knowledge, their pedagogical content knowledge, their conceptions  of
              mathematics, and their understanding of students' mathematical  thinking at
              different points during their teacher preparation.   These findings will be
              compared to the relationship between these  forms of knowledge possessed by
              inservice teachers.  This  knowledge/belief will be operationalized through
              videotapes of  preservice and inservice teachers interviewing and tutoring 
              children.
