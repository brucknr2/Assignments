Abstract    :
              9358158 Yih          The goal of this research project is to develop and apply
              intelligent decision aids to improve system performance in high variety and low
              volume manufacturing environments.  Two critical areas to enhance the
              automation capability and intelligent decision making in such environments are
              knowledge based systems and machine learning.  Specifically, this research
              project is intended to establish an efficient channel between the knowledge
              base  and the knowledge source that may include human expert knowledge,
              simulation results, solutions from mathematical models, and experimental data. 
              To achieve this goal, a learning based approach is gather data on the
              relationship between decisions and systems behavior, and continuously modify
              the knowledge with available new information.  There are three phases involved
              in the planned research:  (1) information selection and representation;  (2)
              rule generation;  and (3) learning algorithms.  This research may results in
              intelligent decision aids that provide high quality and precise decisions in a
              timely manner to achieve production goals in manufacturing systems.         
              This research may be applied to other decision problems in manufacturing if the
              parameters defining state conditions can be digitized, equipment replacement,
              troubleshooting, maintenance, material handling equipment dispatching, job
              assignment, tool management, and facility design. ***
