Abstract    :
              9358380  West    This is a critical evaluation of electrodrodynamic (EHD)
              impedance  spectroscopy as a means of investigating anodically formed films.  
              A second objective is to establish the mechanisms of  electropolishing. 
              Alternating - current (AC) and EHD impedance  spectroscopy methods are used to
              study the electropolishing of  copper in concentrated phosphoric acid and in a
              neutral-salt  electrolyte.  It has been shown previously that a salt film forms
               on the electrode surface during electropolishing in neutral-salt  electrolyte.
               The electrical properties of these films are  determined with AC impedance,
              and transient changes in electrical  properties with film growth are monitored
              by EHD impedance; this  leads to inferences about structural properties and
              mechanisms of  conduction in the films.  In contrast, it has been established 
              whether a solid film is formed when metals are electropolished in  concentrate
              acids.  This is examined with EHD impedance, which can  also test alternatives
              mechanisms for electropolishing.    The result of this research are directly
              applicable to monitoring  and control of production processes used in the
              electronics and  semiconductor industries.
