Abstract    :
              This NYI award will fund research on interfacial and transport                 
              phenomena related to the pulmonary system.  Surfactant physico-                
              chemical properties and their influence on pulmonary mechanics of              
              obstruction clearance as well as droplet spreading on thin films               
              as a model of aerosol medication delivery will be studied.                     
                                                                                             
              This NYI award will also allow the investigator to continue                    
              teaching and developing courses that use interactive software                  
              tools as part of the courses.
