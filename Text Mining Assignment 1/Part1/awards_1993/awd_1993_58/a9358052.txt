Abstract    :
              9358052  Ferrari  Research will be conducted in the area of Micromechanics, that
              is  the stress and failure analysis of inhomogeneous materials,  including
              composites, polycrystals, granular and defective media.  The research will
              establish relationships between the  microstructure and the macroscopic
              properties of materials, their  application to the stress and failure analyses
              of engineering  materials and structures, and the design of advanced materials 
              tailored for specific engineering applications.  These general  objectives will
              be pursued by the joint use of analytical,  computational, and experimental
              methods, applied to various  materials of technological relevance.    The
              poly-inclusion method proposed earlier by the PI will be tested  against
              further exact results.  The development of additional exact  and numerical
              results, respectively for periodic and locally non-  periodic media will be
              undertaken.  On the experimental side,  ultrasonics will be used to determine
              simultaneously the effect  elasticities and the interaction function for
              specific composite  types, and to perform controlled-microstructure
              experiments.  The  ideas will be extended to other inhomogeneous engineering 
              materials, including porous and damaged media, and polycrystals.    Research in
              the area of Functionally-Graded Composites will be  conducted extending
              previous studies on the optimal distribution of  micron-size alumina particles
              in aluminum-based materials.  Micro-  Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) will be
              also studied.  A crucial  characterization technique is the Micromechanical
              Diffraction  Method, as this yields multi-scale residual stresses, the 
              mechanically relevant portion of the texture function, the local  effective
              properties, and various microdistributional data.
