Abstract    :
              Work to be done on this project combines the mathematical theories of closed   
              multiple-valued, matrix valued functions.  The underlying motivation for the 
              studies lies in the expected significant applications to systems theory and 
              functional analysis. The research can be viewed from the point of view of 
              interpolation theory and meromorphic matrix functions, or as explicit work on
              the  correspondence between the Weil divisor approach and the factor of
              automorphy  approach to complex vector bundles over closed Riemann surfaces. 
              In the former  one wants to construct meromorphic matrix valued functions
              interpolating given  points on a closed Riemann surface.  In the latter, one
              takes local solutions to  form a holomorphic vector bundle and asks for
              conditions which guarantee that the  bundle be trivial. This is where Weil's
              work enters.    The work described in this project arises in systems analysis
              where one is  interested in selecting optimal functions from classes all of
              whose members  satisfy the same conditions.  The conditions may be given as
              prescribed pointwise  values of the functions.  It then becomes essential that
              one first solve the  interpolation problem to classify all such functions
              before establishing the  optimal ones.
