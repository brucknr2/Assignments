Abstract    :
                      In phase II, the fundamental microstructure/processing/property
              relationships for ODS magnesium alloys will be investigated. Larger samples
              will be produced while key process parameters are systematically varied. These
              samples will be investigated microstructurally by optical and SEM techniques. 
              Standard elevated temperature tensile and creep testing will be performed in
              condition, the most promising samples will be further processed by hot working
              techniques and the same type of microstructural, mechanical, and physical
              property evaluations.  Successful completion of the Phase II research will
              provide the foundation for future commercialization of ODS magnesium with
              elevated temperature capability and improved modules produced by pressure
              infiltration.  Pressure infiltration is a low cost process and is expected to
              produce cost-effective ODS magnesium alloys.  Such alloys could lead to the
              development of more fuel efficient and environmentally cleaner automobiles.
