Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the work of Dr. Piatetski-Shapiro to work             
              on projects related to Langland's program.  These projects include             
              the problem of unitarity under functorial lifting and is related to            
              the failure of the generalized Ramanujan conjecture.  The second               
              project is devoted to a problem of lifting from classical groups to            
              GL(n).  The third project is devoted to modelling Langland's                   
              correspondence over a finite field.                                            
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
