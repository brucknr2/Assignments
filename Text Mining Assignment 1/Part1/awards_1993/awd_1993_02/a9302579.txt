Abstract    :
              John Schmitt and Gary Bertrand are supported by a grant from   the Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program to study   binary homogeneous nucleation. 
              In this project they will   investigate the surface formation from effects
              observed in the   binary homogeneous nucleation of two octane isomers.  An  
              expansion cloud chamber system will be used to make accurate   nucleation
              measurements over a wide range of temperature,   activity and nucleation rate. 
              The data will  test current   theory and will be used to extend to the binary
              case a   successful single component scaled nucleation theory which  
              specifically incorporates the formation of a droplet surface.    An accurate
              and proven description of the condensation of two   vapors into a liquid
              droplet, binary homogeneous nucleation,   will not only significantly advance
              understanding of the   vapor-to-liquid phase transition, but will also find
              immediate   and extensive applications in such diverse areas as formation   of
              stratospheric aerosol, condensation in turbines, and distillation.
