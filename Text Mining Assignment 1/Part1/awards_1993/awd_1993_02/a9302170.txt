Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The role that eddies and Rossby waves generated by instabilities of            
              the wind-driven circulation have in forcing the deep western                   
              boundary currents and the abyssal circulation will be studied using            
              a combination of analytical and numerical models with increasing               
              complexity.  Of particular interest are the effects of the                     
              continental rise on eddy-driven circulation beneath the Gulf Stream            
              and the weakly non-linear wave-mean flow interactions between a                
              bottom trapped current and topographic Rossby waves.
