              The Twentieth International Conference on Low Temperature Physics              
              (LT20) is a triennial conference sponsored by the International                
              Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAC). It is to held in Eugene,            
              Oregon, USA, August 4-11, 1993. The objective is to provide a forum            
              for low temperature physicists from all over the world to meet and             
              discuss new and current research. The proceedings will be published            
              in three volumes.
