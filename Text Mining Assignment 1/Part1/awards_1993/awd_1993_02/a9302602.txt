Abstract    :
              Passive chemical tracer (chlorofluorocarbon  and carbon  tetrachloride)
              concentrations will be measured along an  hydrographic section from Suva to
              Papeete in the southwest Pacific  as part of the World Ocean Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE) one-time  hydrographic survey. The goal of these measurements
              is to provide  additional estimates of the deep water mass pathways through the
               Samoan Passage and the Robbie ridge.
