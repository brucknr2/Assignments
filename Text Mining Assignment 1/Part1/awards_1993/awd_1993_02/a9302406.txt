Abstract    :
              John R. LaGraff has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                       
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. LaGraff's doctoral degree was in                 
              Materials Science from the University of Illinois under the                    
              supervision of Professor David Payne. Dr. LaGraff will continue                
              research at the University of Illinois under the sponsorship of                
              Professor Andrew Gewirth. Dr. LaGraff's postdoctoral training                  
              will provide him with skills in advanced surface science                       
              techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning                  
              tunneling microscopy (STM). Longer term, he plans to apply AFM                 
              and STM to study the interfaces and surfaces of oxides such as                 
              barium titanate in order to determine the role of local defect                 
              chemistry in controlling nanoscale and bulk property responses.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastuctural program designed to                      
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
