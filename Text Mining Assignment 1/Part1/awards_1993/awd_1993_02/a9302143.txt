Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Detailed studies of the dynamics of small-scale oceanic mixing                 
              events were pursued using a high resolution, three-dimensional                 
              numerical model.  The goal of this study is to improve                         
              parameterizations of ocean mixing by better understanding the                  
              processes taking place under various conditions such as breaking               
              internal gravity waves, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and decaying            
              turbulence.
