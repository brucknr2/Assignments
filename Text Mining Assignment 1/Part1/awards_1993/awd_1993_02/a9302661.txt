Abstract    :
              A fundamental problem in the earth sciences is understanding the                
                                                                                            
              complex dynamic interaction between lithospheric, isostatic,                   
              tectonic, and surficial processes.   This study will use                       
              quantitative tectonic geomorphic analyses of fluvial longitudinal              
                                                                                             
              profiles, coastal stratigraphy, fluvial terraces, pediments,                   
              regional denudation data, and drainage basin morphometry in a well-            
                                                                                             
              constrained setting to evaluate the dynamic interaction between                
              tectonics and topography along a convergent plate margin.
