Abstract    :
              9302182  Dawson    This award supports the Peromyscus (Deer Mouse) Genetic 
              Stock Center.  The Stock Center contains thirty well-  characterized mutant
              lines and six stocks of  "wild-type"  animals representing five species.  Two
              highly inbred  strains of deer mouse are also maintained.  Live and  preserved
              animals, fresh and frozen tissues, molecular  libraries and probes, and other
              materials derived from  Peromyscus are provided to the scientific community as
              a  resource.  Utilization of the Stock Center has nearly  quadrupled since
              1986.  A total of 3230 animals and  specimens were supplied to external
              researchers in 27 states  during the past 5 1/2 years.  Expansion of the Center
              will  include two additional species, P. truei, P. boylii, and one  or more
              inbred strains of white-footed mouse (P. leucopus).  Enhancement of the
              electronic interface capacity with  genetic data bases for other species
              requires installation  of a highspeed computer workstation.  Improved
              organization  of the reference collection of reprints, photographs and  other
              reference materials will be accomplished.  Completion  of a Peromyscus gene
              catalog and its entry into an  electronic database is projected.  The
              peromyscus Molecular  Bank will accelerate its acquisition of a wide variety of
               peromyscine unique sequence probes and diversity of DNA  libraries and promote
              their utilization.  Current services  and activities of the Stock Center,
              including publication of  PEROMYSCUS NEWSLETTER, will continue.  ***
