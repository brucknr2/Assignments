Abstract    :
              This project will examine the geochemistry of oceanic basalts by                
                                                                                            
              isotopic and trace element study to examine detailed geological                
              processes such as magma supply dynamics beneath mid-oceanic ridges,            
                                                                                             
              convection in magma chambers, and ridge-plume mixing phenomena.                
                                                                                             
              Study areas include the East Pacific Rise, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,             
                                                                                             
              and the Galapagos Islands.
