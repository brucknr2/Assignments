Abstract    :
              9302737  Hastings       This project concerns investigations into mathematical 
              problems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations.  There are  six areas
              under investigation.  They include asymptotics and  painleve transcendents
              involving solutions obtained by inverse  scattering, shooting methods applied
              to the study of chaos,  specially in the analysis of Lorenz equations, and
              self-similar  solutions of Barenblatt's fourth order model for the decay of 
              turbulent bursts.  Work will also be done expanding recent  studies of
              stability in modeling solid state diffusion  in semiconductors, asymptotics
              beyond all orders in fifth  order equations and on the smoothing of Stokes
              discontinuities in  the asymptotic expansions of analytic functions.      
              Differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical
              world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the
              equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about
              the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these
              approximations.  ***
