Abstract    :
              Problems associated with the radiocarbon dating of organic-carbon-             
              poor arctic lake sediments have limited the utility of                         
              paleoclimatic inferences drawn from these repositories.  To                    
              evaluate the role of the Arctic in the global climate system from              
              the geological record requires a network of sites, each with a                 
              secure independent geochronology.  Separation of cause and effect,             
              lead and lag times, and distinguishing climate change from                     
              vegetation migration all require temporal resolution better than               
              500 years, about the limit of previous studies.  Although the                  
              precision of 14C measurements by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)           
              has steadily improved during the last decade to its current                    
              precision of <1%, less effort has been directed at separating                  
              heterogeneous lake sediments into its constituent organic                      
              compounds.  The Paleoclimate of Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE)              
              program within the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) initiative                    
              requires both reliable radiocarbon dating and expeditious                      
              processing of samples.  This award will meet this need by providing            
              a standardized sample preparation protocol for organic-carbon-poor             
              arctic lake sediment based on the results of earlier research, and             
              prioritizing sample handling so that basal dates for cores                     
              collected under the PALE initiative will be processed within 2                 
              months of receipt.  Standardized pretreatment for PALE researchers             
              will ensure an adequate number of reliable dates for each core.
