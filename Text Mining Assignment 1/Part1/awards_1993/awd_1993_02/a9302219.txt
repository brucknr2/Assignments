Abstract    :
              9302219  Hamkalo       Two major approaches will be taken to begin an
              investigation  of the molecular basis of differential chromosome condensation
              in  higher eukaryotes.  The first explores the putative role of the  linker
              histone, H1, which exists in multiple amino acid sequence  variants, in
              differential condensation.  Antibodies generated in  the laboratory against
              human subtypes will be used to determine  subtype distribution in situ by
              immunofluoresence and to select by  immunofaffinity methods chromatin fragments
              containing individual  subtypes.  Selected fragments will be analyzed for the
              distribution  of specific DNA sequences in order to determine whether or not 
              subtypes are functionally distinguishable.  The second approach is  designed to
              evaluate a novel method for the fractionation of  specific DNA sequences as
              chromatin (nucleoprotein hybridization)  in order to select primate centromeric
              satellite enriched chromatin  fragments.  %%%  The experiments proposed are
              directed towards the identification of  proteins that underly differential
              chromosome condensation in  vertebrates.  Differentially condensed chromatin is
              a diagnostic  feature of chromosomal centromeres, telomeres and inactive genes.
                Thus, proteins involved in differential condensation may play a  structural
              role as well as a functional role in the repression of  genes.  ***
