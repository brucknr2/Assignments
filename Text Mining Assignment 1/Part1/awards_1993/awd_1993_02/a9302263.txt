Abstract    :
              This award will provide support for a workshop on Identifying                  
              Features in Biological Sequences.  The workshop will take place                
              at Aspen Center for Physics from May 24, 1993 to June 13, 1993.                
              The participants of the workshop will come from fields of                      
              mathematics and statistics, computer science, and molecular                    
              biology.  The workshop will focus on the problems of extracting                
              biological information from sequences, but with diverse enough                 
              approaches that many of the participants would not have otherwise              
              interact with each other.  This workshop is being jointly                      
              supported by the Theory of Computing and the Computational                     
              Biology Activities programs.
