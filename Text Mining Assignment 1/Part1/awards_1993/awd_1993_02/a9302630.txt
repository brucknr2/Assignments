Abstract    :
              One of the major questions with respect to volcanic activity in all             
                                                                                            
              settings is the relationship between the geometry of magma supply              
                                                                                             
              at depth and the patterns of eruption of lavas at the surface.                 
              This project is an interdisciplinary study of Kilauea's Puna Ridge             
                                                                                             
              and mid-oceanic ridges.  It will compare petrological,                         
              morphological, side-scan sonar, and photographic data in order to              
                                                                                             
              compare magma supply patterns and magmatic and structural                      
              organization in these two settings.
