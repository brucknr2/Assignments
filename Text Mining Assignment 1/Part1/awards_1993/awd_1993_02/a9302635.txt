Abstract    :
              Monazite is a rare-earth element phosphate that occurs as an                   
              accessory mineral in a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks.               
                                                                                             
              It is of interest to geochronologists because the mineral                      
              incorporates uranium into its crystal structure and can thus be                
              used in age-dating.  This project will study the temperature-                  
              dependent diffusion parameters for Pb in monazite, allowing                    
              geoscientists to utilize this potential for dating geologic events.
