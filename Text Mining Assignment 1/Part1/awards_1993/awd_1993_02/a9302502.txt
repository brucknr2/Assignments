Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs propose to develop a real-time interactive laboratory             
              permitting undergraduate and graduate students in Alaska to conduct            
              and participate in real-time experiments at the NSF Sondrestrom                
              Radar Observatory.  An example of this proposal's objective is the             
              ability in real-time to modify the radar mode to take advantage of             
              certain geophysical conditions such as an auroral riometer                     
              absorption, or PCA event.  The potential advantage of interfacing              
              the Sondrestrom data stream to the NCSA standards would be to                  
              enhance the data display and analysis capabilities of students and             
              provide a bridge to supercomputer models.
