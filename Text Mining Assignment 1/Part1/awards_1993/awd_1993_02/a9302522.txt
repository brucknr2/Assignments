Abstract    :
              9302522  Cerf       A research and development project is proposed to extend the
               results obtained in the earlier period of this cooperative project  among the
              National Science Foundation, National Library of  Medicine, and the Corporation
              for National Research Initiatives  (CNRI).  Working closely with the National
              Library of Medicine,  CNRI proposed to design and implement a prototype
              distributed  Application Gateway System (AGS) which will be situated between 
              existing and planned NLM information databases and users located on  the
              Internet.       An AGS is made up of one or more powerful network servers 
              interlinked on a high speed local area network.  The AGS can  service users
              with simple interactive terminals or it can accept  and process Knowbot
              programs which embody active search strategies  constructed at the User Agent
              but interpreted by the AGS.  Each  element of the distributed AGS system can be
              configured to provide  access to unique or replicated services.  At the
              completion of the  proposed three-phase effort, the multiple components of the
              AGS  will be manageable from a network-based management station.       To test
              the theories behind the Knowbot-based Application  Gateway System,  it is
              proposed to deploy an experimental, scalable  system on the National Library of
              Medicine campus, link it to the  Internet and to explore its functionality and
              performance in that  operational setting.
