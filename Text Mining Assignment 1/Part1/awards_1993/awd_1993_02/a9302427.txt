Abstract    :
              Scott F. Singleton has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                    
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Singleton's doctoral degree was                   
              from the California Institute of Technology under the                          
              supervision of Professor Peter Dervan. Dr. Singleton will                      
              continue research at Pennsylvania State University under the                   
              sponsorship of Professor Stephen Benkovic. Dr. Singleton's                     
              postdoctoral training will provide him with the techniques                     
              necessary for detailed examinations of the kinetics and                        
              mechanistic functions of enzymatic systems. Longer term he                     
              plans to design and synthesize proteins that will bind specific                
              electron donor-acceptor pairs which will mediate photoinduced                  
              electron transfer.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
