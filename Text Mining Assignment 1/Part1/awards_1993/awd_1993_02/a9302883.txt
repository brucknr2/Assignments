Abstract    :
              9302883  Anderson  The purpose of this project is the comprehensive experimental
              and theoretical examination of tensile-strained quantum-well-heterostructure
              lasers.  Emphasis will be on the systematic identification of physical
              mechanisms responsible for the significant performance improvements recently
              observed in these types of lasers, and application of this information to
              high-performance laser design.  Sets of strained-layer laser samples designed
              to elucidate trends in lasing properties with variations in specific
              quantum-well with the help of a detailed model of strained-layer lasers to be
              developed as part of this work.  Investigations of the effects of externally
              applied compressive and tensile uniaxial stresses will be included.  It is
              important that these studies will encompass wide ranges of well widths and
              compositions, thus spanning the range of band structure configurations
              available in tensile-strained quantum wells, and will emphasize careful
              isolation of various materials, strain, and quantum confinement effects through
              a combination of theoretical and direct experimental means.  Finally, the
              information gained form these studies will be applied to the design,
              fabrication, and testing of optimized low-threshold tensile-strained lasers and
              new structures with unique tensile-strained active regions.  Specific focus
              will be on InxGa1-xAs-InP and GaAsy-1-AlxGa1-xAs lasers.  ***
