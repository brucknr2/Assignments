Abstract    :
              D'Hondt  9302483    The PIs will use chronostratigraphic techniques to test the
              regional  and global extent of Late Cretaceous oceanographic conditions. The 
              oceanographic response to Milankovitch forcing during periods of  stability
              will be deciphered through an integrated analysis of  paleoceanographic proxies
              and development of cyclostratigraphic records  at critical sites. Magnetic
              susceptibility, carbonate and terrigenous  flux, planktonic foraminiferal and
              stable isotopic studies are planned.  The focus will be on South Atlantic and
              Indian Ocean sites.
