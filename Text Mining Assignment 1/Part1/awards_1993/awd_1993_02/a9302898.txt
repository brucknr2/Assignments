Abstract    :
                   It is now well established that zoospore-producing fungi that             
              are able to weaken fiber and disrupt lignified tissues of forage               
              are an integral part of the anaerobic microbial population of the              
              rumen of herbivores.  These fungi produce cellulases, xylanases and            
              other enzymes that break down the complex polymers of plant cell               
              wall material.  To date, isolations of anaerobic zoosporic fungi               
              have been limited to rumen fluid and feces.  However, there is                 
              ample evidence to suggest that these fungi are able to survive and             
              grow outside the host animal.  The objective of this project is to             
              isolate, examine and characterize zoosporic fungi from natural                 
              anaerobic environments such as ponds, marshes and landfills.

              Results from this project would be used to set up experiments to               
              determine the possible role of these fungi in the degradation of               
              naturally-occurring recalcitrant fibrous material.
