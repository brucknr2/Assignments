                    9302145 Chew The previous support period under the 5 year PYI grant
              enabled the investigator to make significant progress in both inverse and
              forward scattering theory.  New non linear inverse scattering methods were
              developed to account for multiple scattering effects within the scattering
              object.  The Born iterative method (BIM) and distorted Born iterative method
              (DBIM) were developed that demonstrated the inversion of objects with contrasts
              as great as 10:1 and exhibited super resolution on the order of 0.1
              wavelengths.  Another new technique known as the local shape function (LSF)
              method was developed to perform inverse scattering on metallic scatters where
              previous methods failed to produce a convergent solution due to extremely
              strong nonlinearities.  Recently it was found that the LSF method could also be
              used for the inversion of dielectric scatters and bypass the 10:1 contrast
              limitation. The need to invert very large scattering objects stimulated
              research in fast forward scattering solvers.  These fast algorithms solve the
              scattering problem exactly and achieve computational savings by exploiting
              inherent redundancies in the scattering calculations.  The first of these
              algorithms (RTMA) solved the         ? 0     scattering problem valid for all
              incidence sources in )(N   2.5   ) operations by exploiting translational
              properties of wave phenomenon.  T he next algorithm (RATMA) exploited an
              aggregation         ?       property resulting in an O(N   2   ) algorithm. 
              The new algorithm (NEPAL) instead uses the surface equivalence principle
              resulting in         ?       an O(N   1.5   ) algorithm that is amenable to
              parallel processing. The current proposal is to continue progress in developing
              new nonlinear inverse scattering theories.  We plan to move away for the Born
              type methods and exploit new ways of parameterizing the scattering object in
              order to achieve the best possible reconstruction.  We will use our progress in
              fast forward scattering solvers as building blocks to speed up the inversion
              and solve much larger objects.  Other means of solving large objects,
              particularly objects buried in a slowly varying inhomogeneous background would
              be investigated as well.  Finally, we wish to develop new experimental
              apparatus that can achieve high fidelity measurements so that the full
              potential of these new inverse methods could be achieved in a practical system.
