Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Chemical reactions can be made to occur using miscible polymer                 
              blends that offer the opportunity for the design of new material               
              systems with enhancements in properties and/or processing.  We will            
              study miscible polymer blends containing silanol and phosphonic                
              acid substituents as H-bond donors with a variety of H-bond                    
              acceptor polymers.  These systems are new types of miscible blends.            
              The specific interaction should stabilize the silanol function and             
              prevent its premature reaction with itself to give siloxane.                   
              However, at temperatures above the lower critical solution                     
              temperature, phase separation and subsequent siloxane formation                
              should occur, thereby giving fast-curing polymer networks.                     
                                                                                             
              Phosphorus-containing structures have wide use for decreasing                  
              flammability.  In some systems by enhance condensed-phase reactions            
              at elevated temperatures leading to "char" or residue enhancement              
              and decreased flammability.  This will be studied in miscible                  
              blends containing phosphonic acid function e.g., with styrene                  
              copolymers containing the hydrogen-bond donor groups in the para               
              position.
