Abstract    :
              In vitro mutagenesis has been used extensively  in probing the                 
              structure and function of ribosomal RNA from the bacterium E. coli             
              Only recently has this powerful technique been applied toward the              
              study of ribosomal proteins.  The objective of this planning grant             
              is the modification of a two plasmid, inducible expression system              
              based upon T7 RNA polymerase that was adapted for an investigation             
              of E. coli ribosomal protein L2.  This system has made it possible             
              to quickly identify dominant-negative mutations by replica plating             
              transformants at two different temperatures.  The refinements being            
              carried out in this study is the coupled expression of a mutant                
              ribosomal protein gene and an rRNA operon that codes for an                    
              antibiotic resistance.  Upon induction of the T7 RNA polymerase                
              expression system, the vast majority of de novo ribosomes will                 
              include of an antibiotic resistance marker as well as the targeted             
              mutant ribosomal protein during subunit assembly.  Wild type                   
              ribosomes assembled prior to induction will be functionally                    
              eliminated by the inclusion of the appropriate antibiotic during               
              invitro activity assays.  This will allow for mutant ribosomal                 
              subunits assembled in vivo to be characterized in vitro for their              
              activity/inactivity in the partial reactions of protein synthesis,             
              eliminating the need to physically separate the two ribosome                   
              populations.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The planning grant is testing the applicability of a new technique             
              to the study of ribosomal RNA-protein interactions.  Completion of             
              the work will help us better understand the mechanism by which                 
              proteins are synthesized in all cells.
