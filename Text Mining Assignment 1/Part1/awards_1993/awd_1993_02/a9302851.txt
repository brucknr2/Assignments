Abstract    :
              9302851  Sieradzan       This is an RUI proposal for the precision measurement 
              of atomic excited-state interactions in one-and two-electron  atoms.  The
              experiment would improve the determination of  such quantities by an order of
              magnitude with significant  implications for theoretical calculations which are
              crucial  to the interpretation of atomic parity violation  experiments.  The
              experimental approach would be a pump-  delayed-prove method to achieve
              spectral resolutions well  below the natural linewidths.
