Abstract    :
              9302379 Bluestein The purpose of the proposed research is to improve the
              physical understanding of the processes responsible for the formation and
              evolution of serve convective storms.  Special attention will be given to
              tornadic supercells initiated near the dryline and to the development of
              analysis techniques using data from an airborne Doppler radar and from a
              surface mesonetwork.  The objectives will be met in large part through the
              analysis of data from a NOAA P 3 airborne Doppler radar, from a PAM surface
              mesonetwork, and from mobile CLASS soundings collected during the cooperative
              Oklahoma Profiler Studies (COPS 91) experiment held during the spring of 1991. 
              There will also be analysis of data from the new Oklahoma Mesonet, dual Doppler
              radar data from a 1981 field program conducted by the National Severe Storms
              Laboratory (NSSL), mobile soundings, wind Profiler data, and visual
              documentation of storm features. ***
