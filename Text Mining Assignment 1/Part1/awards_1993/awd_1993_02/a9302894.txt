Abstract    :
              9302894  Cederberg         This RUI proposal concerns the measurement of
              hyperfine  structure in sequences of vibrational and rotational states  in
              small molecules using a high-resolution molecular beam  electric resonance
              spectrometer. These spectra will provide  improved values for hyperfine
              interaction constants and will  be used to determine the variation with
              internuclear  distance of electric field gradients at each nuclear site.  The
              field gradients will be compared with those obtained  from theoretical
              calculations of electron wave functions.
