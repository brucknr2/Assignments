Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will focus in on  some problems                
              involving theta functions, the Siegel-Weil formula, values and                 
              derivatives of L-functions and algebraic cycles on Shimura                     
              varieties.  A generalization of the work of Waldspurger and of                 
              Gross and Zagier will be attempted, together with problems that                
              concern the completion of the theory of the standard L-function for            
              classical groups via the doubling method of Piatetski-Shapiro and              
              Rallis.                                                                        
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
