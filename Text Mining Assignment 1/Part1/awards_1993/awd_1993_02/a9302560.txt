Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Paul Dowd at the University of                    
              Pittsburgh to study a new experimental model for the vitamin                   
              K-dependent carboxylation to further unravel its essential role in             
              the complex events of blood clotting. The oxygenation of vitamin K             
              will be studied using isotopically labeled oxygen. This will be                
              followed by other oxygenations and investigations of the nature of             
              the base(s) involved and of the effects of other strong bases on               
              activity. Intramolecular models, micelles, liposomes and                       
              environments that mimic those of the membrane locale of the                    
              vitamin K action will also be explored.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project Dr. Paul Dowd will conduct an extensive set of                 
              oxygenation studies, using labeled molecular oxygen, to unravel the            
              complex mechanism of blood clotting in which vitamin K plays an                
              essential role. Not only is a new experimental model used for the              
              action of vitamin K, but also its environment is modelled to mimic             
              the membrane locale where the vitamin is active. The influence of              
              strong bases on vitamin K's activity is an important part of this              
              study.
