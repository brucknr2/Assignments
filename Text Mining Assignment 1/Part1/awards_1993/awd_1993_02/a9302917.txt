Abstract    :
                Neural networks have gained much publicity in the scientific  and popular
              press as a new method of computation that is  superior to standard  techniques.
               Early successes with small  problem instances have generated  optimistic
              conjectures that  neural network solutions to computationally  difficult tasks 
              will scale to real-world problems.  The project focuses   on the development
              and application of techniques in computational complexity,   in order to bring
              more rigor into the study of the    scalability of neural networks to large
              problems.    In addition, this research focuses on quantifying both their 
              computational  abilities and their capacity to learn from experience.  One 
              objective is the formal analysis of neural networks whose  performance has 
              hitherto only been guessed at from  experimental evidence on small or randomly 
              generated  problems.  Specific subjects to be investigated include:  (1) upper 
              and lower bounds on the weights of linear  threshold functions, (2) the 
              complexity of popular Hopfield  network algorithms, (3) the complexity of the 
              loading  problem for analog neural networks with a fixed number of  nodes,  
              (4) mistake bounds for variants of the perception learning algorithm.
