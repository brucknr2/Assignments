Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall objective of this investigation is delineation of                  
              mechanisms of thermal destruction and product formation (major                 
              product species as well as dioxins and furans) during the pyrolysis            
              and combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) fuels at different             
              air/fuel ratios and various surrounding thermal and chemical                   
              environments.  Soot and carbonaceous particles formed during                   
              pyrolysis and combustion of various CHC fuels as well as ignition              
              delay times over a range of temperatures will also be determined.              
              Droplets/particles of CHC fuels representative of industrial                   
              hazardous wastes will be selected and their time-resolved behavior             
              during passage along the axis of controlled temperature-composition            
              reactor determined.  Information will thus be obtained on the                  
              thermal destruction, vaporization, and combustion of these fuels               
              under well-defined conditions of fuel particle/droplet size, inter-            
              particle spacing, and thermal and chemical envirionment around the             
              particle in order to guide the development of strategies for                   
              effective thermal destruction of hazardous wastes in addition to               
              determining ignition delays, combustion rates, destruction                     
              efficiencies, and formation of volatile organic compounds, dioxins,            
              furans, soot, and carbonaceous particles during combustion.  This              
              approach will yield rate and mechanistic information on the thermal            
              destruction and and product formation of CHC fuels.  Particular                
              emphasis will be place on definition of approaches for avoidance               
              of formation of chlorine, phosgene, soot, particulates, dioxins,               
              and furans during the combustion of such fuels.                                
                                                                                             
              The incentive for this research arises from the need for scientific            
              and engineering information on the combustion and pollution                    
              characteristics of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds such that                 
              large-scale hazardous chemical waste incineration systems can be               
              designed and operated more reliably and satifactorily in an                    
              environmentally acceptable manner without undue hazard to human                
              health and environment.  The lack of our present understanding on              
              the combustion characteristics of CHCs, particularly as regards                
              thermal destruction and production of various toxic products, has              
              resulted in the use of highly empirical methods for design of                  
              incinerators.  This research program is aimed at development of a              
              better understanding of the thermal destruction and product                    
              formation mechanisms, as well as determination of information                  
              regarding formation of soot and particulates and ignition delay                
              times associated with these species during the incineration of                 
              hazardous chlorinated wastes.
