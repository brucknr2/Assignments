Abstract    :
              9302926  Polak  This is a three year proposal for research on the construction
              of  efficient numerical methods, based on the concept of consistent 
              approximations, for the solution of optimization problems arising  in control,
              shape design, and integrated design of actively  controlled structures.  In
              particular, we will address the  following issues:  (i) the development of a
              general theory of  algorithms based on consistent approximations for
              semi-infinite  optimization, optimal control, and optimal shape design; (ii)
              the  determination of the effects of the order and complexity of  numerical
              integration formulae for ODE's and evolution on the  computational efficiency
              of algorithms for the solution of  optimal control problems, with control and
              state space  constraints;  (iii) the development of basic elements needed for 
              the solution of shape optimization problems via consistent  approximations,
              such as consistent optimality functions for shape  optimization problems and
              their discrete approximations,  numerical integration methods for PDE's that
              satisfy certain  uniformity conditions, as well as subalgorithms that can cope 
              efficiently with the very high dimensional problems that result  from
              discretization.  ***
