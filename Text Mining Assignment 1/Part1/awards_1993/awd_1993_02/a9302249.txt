Abstract    :
                    9302249  Borning                         This is the first year of a
              three-year continuing award to  investigate the use of the constaint-based
              languages and systems  and their hirarchies in interactive interfaces.  Four
              specific  constraint-based language and environment areas are targeted in  this
              project:  1) the study and development of efficient  incremental constraint
              satifaction alogrithms, including algorithms  for systems with cycles and
              constraints with multiple outputs, 2)  the improvement of debugging tools and
              techniques for constraint  satisfaction systems, 3) the integration of the
              constraint-based  language use with an object-oriented imperative language, and
              4)  the testing and validation of results from the three previously  mentioned
              research areas in an exploratory interactive application  such as a
              how-things-work electronic encyclopedia.
