Abstract    :
              9302258  Parish         The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate 
              electrodynamic coupling between the high and low latitude  ionosphere during
              periods of raised geomagnetic activity and to  study the dynamo effects of
              planetary waves in the lower  thermosphere and their influence on the F-region
              ionosphere.  These  two areas of research will be addressed by analyzing
              measurements  from ionosonde and magnetometer stations close to the geomagnetic
               equator and, for the electrodynamic coupling study, values of the  AE index
              will also be analyzed.  Spectral analysis will be  performed on these data for
              the whole of 1979 and fluctuations with  periods between a few hours and two
              days will be examined.  ***
