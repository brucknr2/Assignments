Abstract    :
                   This award supports a meeting, planned for September,  1993 in            
              Panama City, to bring together researchers who are interested in               
              the study of past global changes in the Americas.  The focus of the            
              meeting is to foster cooperative research strategies and link with             
              already existing initiatives to further our understanding of                   
              dynamics of past climate change in a trans-equatorial transect.                
              Such coordination is urgently needed to assess global predictions              
              of future climate change.  The outcome of the meeting will consist             
              of documentation of an encompassing research strategy of                       
              paleoclimate research in the Americas, including existing and                  
              proposed research plans and possible international cooperation                 
              strategies for their implementation.
