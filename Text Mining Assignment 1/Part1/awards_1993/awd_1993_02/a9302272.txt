              9302272  Wessel       The Principal Investigator and Co-PI are the authors of
              the  Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software package, a tool for generic

              The GMT, including source code, support data,  UNIX manual pages, and
              documentation, is available over the  Internet by anonymous ftp and has been
              widely used since its  release in 1991. This award provides support to update
              the GMT  package.  ***
