Abstract    :
                   Wallach will investigate invariant differential operators                 
              acting on invariant distributions on a reductive Lie algebra,                  
              diagonal invariants and harmonics for Coxeter groups, Automorphic              
              forms related to the error term in asymptotic behavior of lattice              
              point problem and the Kloosterman-Selberg zeta function.  Wallach              
              will also work to develop parallel computer algorithms for the                 
              calculation of Groebner bases and a general software package to                
              be used in the study of diagonal invariants and harmonics for                  
              Coxeter groups.                                                                
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
