Abstract    :
              9302588  Concus       The purpose of this conference is to bring together 
              researchers from the international scientific community who are  active in
              geometric analysis, continuum mechanics, calculus of  variations, and in
              nonlinear partial differential equations. All  of these fields interrelate,
              sometimes in remarkable and  surprising ways that have led to striking and
              unexpected  discoveries with physical implications. One such discovery was 
              verified last year in a microgravity fluid mechanics experiment  carried out
              aboard an orbiting NASA Space Shuttle flight. This  experiment and also many
              other such activities arose largely from  the pioneering work of Prof. Robert
              Finn, to whom the conference  is dedicated. We anticipate that the proposed
              conference will set  the stage for new scientific advances of both mathematical
              and  practical physical significance. An important part of our  objective is to
              encourage graduate students to participate in the  meeting; we hope thus to
              spark their active interest in the many  new and exciting discoveries that are
              now being made or waiting  to be made.
