Abstract    :
              9302318  Auchmuty       The investigator studies the construction, analysis and 
              numerical simulation of variational principles for certain  problems in fluid
              mechanics, field theories, chemistry and  astronomy.  He also studies certain
              minimax problems and the  development of algorithms for the numerical solution
              of nonconvex  extremal problems.       The problems to be studied here include
              the analysis and  development of algorithms for modeling atoms and molecules
              using  the equations of quantum chemistry.  Similar methods also apply  in
              studying the equations for vortices in fluids (which are  important in studying
              hurricanes and tornadoes) and models of  rotating stars and planets.  These are
              all described by systems  of nonlinear partial differential equations which
              arise from  "nonconvex" variational principles.  This proposal studies  aspects
              of the mathematics of such problems and also questions of  developing
              algorithms for solving these problems computationally.  ***
