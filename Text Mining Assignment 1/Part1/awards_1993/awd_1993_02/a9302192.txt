Abstract    :
              McNutt  9302192    The PIs will analyze geophysical data and perform modelling
              on  Galapagos Hot Spot data to understand how hot spots interact with  a
              spreading center.  This is an extension of the current work on  modelling
              bathymetry and gravity in the Galapagos.  A 3-D modelling  experiment will be
              performed to explore the influences of viscosity  variations, pressure
              gradients and buoyance forces on plume  entrainment and dispersion, temperature
              structure and melt  production.  The model will be used to calculate excess
              crustal  thickness, depth anomalies, gravity anomalies and variations in the 
              elastic plate thickness.  The overall goal is to better understand  mantle
              dynamics of ridge-lume interactions.
