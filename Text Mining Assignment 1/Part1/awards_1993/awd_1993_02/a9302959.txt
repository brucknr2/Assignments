Abstract    :
              9302959  Shin  In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the 
              Chemistry Division Prof. Seung Koo Shin of the University of  California at
              Santa Barbara will pursue an experimental program  of research on the
              photoinitiated reactions of ion-molecule  complexes in the gas phase.  The work
              will include  investigations on the vibrational predissociation of certain 
              reaction intermediates, spectroscopic studies of charge-  transfer-to-solvent
              transitions, orbital orientations in  ion-molecule reactions, and ab initio
              quantum mechanical and  dynamics calculations.  %%%  Detailed, molecular-level
              studies on molecular reactions in the  gas phase stand at the forefront of
              contemporary physical  chemistry.  Among the goals of such investigations is an
               examination of how the rotational states of a reaction complex are  affected
              by specific excited vibrational modes.  Since many  reactions involve the
              interactions between ions and neutral  molecules, reaction intermediates of
              ion-molecule complexes are  of primary interest in the present investigation. 
              The results  of this work will contribute to a  better understanding of 
              solution reactivity and photochemistry.  ***
