Abstract    :
              9302591  Tenney         FORTE'93 will be the Sixth International Conference on 
              Formal Description Techniques ("FDTs").  The FORTE series of  conferences
              concentrates on formal techniques applicable to  distributed systems and
              protocols.  Initially the focus was  on the techniques standardized by ISO and
              CCITT (Estelle,  LOTOS, and SDI), but the scope has widened  considerably,  and
              recent FORTE conferences have also included papers on  CCS, CSP, ANS, 1 , Z,
              Actor, VDM, RAISE, and other  techniques.  In addition to a strong theoretical
              component,  FORTE, has always included a practical component,  attracting,
              practitioners in the field by actively  soliciting papers from industry and
              including demonstrations  of electronic tools for manipulating formal
              descriptions of  systems.  Much of the importance of these formal techniques 
              is the contribution that their use can make in  improving  the software of
              distributed systems.       The conference provides a forum for presentation of
              the  state of the art in theory, application, tools and  industrialization of
              formal techniques and provides an  excellent orientation for newcomers.      
              By bringing together both researchers and  practitioners, FORTE conferences
              open communications between  these groups.  This helps keep the research vital
              and  improves the state of the practitioner's art.  By  facilitating the
              participation of graduate students, the NSF  broadens the experience of the
              students and helps assure  growth in the United States in this important
              research area.
