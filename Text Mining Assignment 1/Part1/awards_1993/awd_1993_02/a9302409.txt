Abstract    :
              Dr. Carl D. Frisbie has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                   
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Frisbie's doctoral degree was from                
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision                
              of Professor Mark Wrighton. Dr. Frisbie will continue research                 
              at Harvard University under the sponsorship of Professor                       
              Charles Lieber. Dr. Frisbie's postdoctoral experience will                     
              train him in surface imaging techniques, particularly scanning                 
              tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) as                
              applied to materials chemistry. Longer term, he plans to study                 
              the structure and ion dynamics of fast ion conductors by AFM                   
              and scanning surface harmonic microscopy.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
