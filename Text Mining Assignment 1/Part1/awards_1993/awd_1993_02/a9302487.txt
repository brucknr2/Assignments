Abstract    :
              MOORE  9302487  This project will use stable isotopes and assemblages of two
              groups of microfossils   to provide a detailed reconstruction of surface water
              circulation in the eastern   equatorial Pacific through the Pliocene. The
              authors hypothesize that closing of the   Isthmus of Panama led to conditions
              which created the warm fresh pool of water   observed in the area today, and
              that the pool in turn is responsible for the modern   equatorially-asymmetric
              circulation. They hope to determine the relationship of these   events to the
              increase of northern hemisphere glaciation documented elsewhere.
