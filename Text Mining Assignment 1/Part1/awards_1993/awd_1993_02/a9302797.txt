Abstract    :
              An SGER award will be used to make preliminary studies of the                  
              electrical field which develops between snow and ice and a                     
              sliding dielectric material.  The local character of the field in              
              relation to the microstructure of the ice, the thickness of its                
              surface liquid-like layer and the nature of the slider-ice                     
              interaction will be determined.  The potential influence of this               
              rather strong field on the friction will be studied by performing              
              friction tests at various temperatures and sliding velocities.                 
              The possibilities of affecting the friction and adhesion levels                
              by an imposed field will also be explored.
