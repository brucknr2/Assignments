Abstract    :
                   This award supports work on the fundamental group of a                    
              smooth quasiprojective variety defined over the field of complex               
              numbers.  If such a variety maps properly onto a hyperbolic                    
              curve, its fundamental group surjects onto a nonabelian free                   
              group.  The principal investigator will determine to what extent               
              the converse holds.  The problem will be attacked by a variety of              
              methods.  These include a generalization of the Castenuovo-De                  
              Franchis lemma, the construction of L2 harmonic 1-forms on the                 
              universal cover, and a study of certain homologically defined                  
              subsets of the groups of 1-dimensional characters of the                       
              fundamental group.                                                             
                   This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of              
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
