Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
              William M. Jones at the University of Florida, Gainesville to study three
              related topics in organometallic chemistry.  The first concerns the development
              of carbene migratory insertions in the iron triad.  This chemistry concentrates
              on the use of carbene complexes of the late transition metals iron, ruthenium,
              and osmium and aims to explore catalyzed migratory insertions and
              rearrangements of unstabilized complexes, and also will compare their aptitude
              for migratory insertions.  The second topic of study concerns the synthesis of
              mainly zirconium complexes with molecules containing highly strained multiple
              bonds with particular emphasis on cyclic cumulenes and cyclopropenes.  The
              third area deals with the formation and reactions of transition metal complexes
              of tropynes, metalloazulenes, and metallobenzenes.  In this project Professor
              William M. Jones will study reactivity aspects of carbene complexes of the late
              transition metals iron, ruthenium, and osmium.  The work will concentrate on
              carbene migratory insertions, on structural and synthetic aspects of complexed
              strained alkenes and alkynes, and on the synthesis of novel metalloaromatics.
