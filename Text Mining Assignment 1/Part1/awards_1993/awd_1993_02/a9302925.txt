Abstract    :
                   This award will support collaborative research by                         
              Professor Thompson and scientists at the Budker Institute of                   
              Nuclear Physics at Novosibirsk, USSR.  Professor Thompson will                 
              study the decays of the phi-meson into pairs of K-mesons.                      
              These decays are sensitive to the origins of CP-violation in                   
              quark decay.
