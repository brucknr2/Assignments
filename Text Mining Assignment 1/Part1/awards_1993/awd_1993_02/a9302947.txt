Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports cooperative work between

              Hefei, China on wake dynamics around a cylinder                                
              in oscillatory flows.  This is an important                                    
              problem, with potential application to                                         
              understanding offshore wave loading on pile                                    
              structures. This collaboration involves the                                    
              strengths and innovation in computational                                      
              approaches of the Chinese team, and the US PI's                                
              experience and accomplishments in prediction of                                
              unsteady wakes.  Both countries will benefit from                              
              further understanding of such phenomena as                                     
              boundary layer separation, vortex shedding, flow                               
              instability, wake turbulence, and wake vortex                                  
              motions due to both induced-velocity and                                       
              convective effects.  These results may be applied                              
              to improved design of offshore structures.                                     
                                                                                             
              This award provides eighteen months of graduate                                
              student support, which will be used to enable the                              
              participation of a US student.  The Chinese have                               
              obtained support from the Chinese National                                     
              Natural Science Foundation.
