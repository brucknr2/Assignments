Abstract    :
              9302292  Patterson    The objective of this research is to understand grain
              growth in  multiphase materials that exhibit wide variations in amount and 
              structure of a grain-growth inhibiting phase.  The studies are  performed on
              experimental materials created with desired initial  microstructures.  The
              effects of controlled variations in basic but  critical parameters such as
              volume fraction, shape, location,  mobility, stability, and contiguity of the
              growth inhibiting phase  are examined.  Elevated temperature grain growth
              anneals are  employed with stereological measurements to analyze the evolving 
              grain and inhibiting phase structures.  The data are analyzed using  a grain
              growth model derived from recent research to test and  further refine the
              model.    %%%  The knowledge gained from these studies will be of scientific
              and  technological value, broadly applicable to a wide range of  conventional
              and advanced materials.  ***
