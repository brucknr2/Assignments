Abstract    :
              9302792  Stevenson    This U.S.-Hungary research on the "Photochemistry and 
              Photophysics of Copper(I) Complexes in Solution" is between  Dr. Kenneth L.
              Stevenson of Purdue University and Dr. Attila  Horvath and Dr. Otto Horvath of
              the University of Veszprem.  This  work will examine (1) hydrated electron
              scavenging mechanisms in  the photolysis of copper(I) complexes with halo-,
              pseudohalo, and  amine ligands, and (2) luminescence and the mechanism for 
              exciplex formation in such complexes, and in similar complexes of  other
              coordinating metals.  The study will use uv-visible  adsorption and
              luminescence spectroscopy, and Nd-YAG laser flash  photolysis in the
              nano-second time regime and ultraviolet  wavelength region.  Results should
              improve our understanding of  the fundamental behavior of exciplexes and
              solvated electrons in  inorganic photochemical systems.  Copper offers many 
              possibilities for efficient photogeneration of hydrated  electrons, which could
              be used for certain chemical processes  requiring reducing agents.      This
              proposed research in chemistry fulfills the program  objectives of advancing
              science by enabling leading experts in  the U.S. and Hungary to combine
              complementary talents and pool  research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and  competence.
