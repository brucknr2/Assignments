Abstract    :
              9302098  McClymont  This U.S.-Argentina Program award will support the 
              collaboration of Alexander McClymont of the University of  Hawaii at Manoa and
              Marta Rovira of the Instituto de  Astronom a y F sica del Espacio in Buenos
              Aires, Argentina.  The project aims to understand the mechanism of gradual 
              magnetic energy dissipation in active regions and the  physical conditions
              required to trigger the impulsive  release of energy that produces solar
              flares.    The physical mechanisms responsible for heating solar flares  and
              active regions are not yet understood.  Energy is  thought to originate from
              the magnetic field in both cases,  but the release mechanisms must be quite
              different.  Heating  of the active region atmosphere is quasi-steady, whereas 
              energy is released impulsively in flares.  In this project,  the researchers
              will conduct an integrated study of magnetic  energy release in the solar
              corona, combining both  theoretical studies and the analysis of observational
              data.  Both the U.S. and Argentine sides will benefit from the  interaction of
              participating theorists and data analysts who  share an interest in the
              dynamics and energetics of flares  and active regions.  ***
