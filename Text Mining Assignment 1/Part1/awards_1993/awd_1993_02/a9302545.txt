Abstract    :
              9302545  Peskin       This award will support computational studies of the
              heart,  the development of the immersed boundary method, and the  production of
              software involving the immersed boundary method for  the biological community. 
              The first component of the project  will be the creation of a computer model of
              the heart that is  efficient enough and realistic enough to be a practical 
              scientific tool for the computational investigation of cardiac  function.  One
              goal of the project is to produce simulations of  imaging modalities (e.g.
              color-Doppler flow, MRI) that are used  in biological experimentation so that
              the output from the  computer experiment can be directly compared to
              experimental  data.  This type of output make possible a direct comparison 
              between simulated and actual data. To the extent that the two  agree, this
              lends support to the validity of the model. Another  benefit from such
              comparison is this:  if the model is valid \,  then the simulated data can be
              used to enhance the visualization  technique.  The software component of this
              project will be  develop in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
              Center.   The project is being supported by the Computational Mathematics,  the
              Physiology, and the Computational Biology programs.  ***
