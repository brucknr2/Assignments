Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports collaboration between Barry                                
              Rosen, Wayne State University, and Liu Shusen,

              structure-function relationships of an anion-                                  
              translocating ATPase in E. coli.  The project                                  
              will focus on the catalytic subunit of the                                     
              oxyanion pump, which is responsible for extruding                              
              arsenite from cells.  Dr. Rosen's group will                                   
              perform the protein purification and mutagenesis,                              
              and Dr. Liu's group will perform the rapid                                     
              kinetic measurements.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The Chinese collaborator is head of one of                                     
              China's most advanced laboratories ("key labs")                                
              which has been heavily supported by the Chinese                                
              government through World Bank loans. The lab has                               
              equipment unavailable in the US PI's lab,                                      
              providing an important complementary capability.                               
              Dr. Rosen has students of Dr. Liu working in his                               
              lab at Wayne State; collaboration between Liu and                              
              Rosen will help keep the skills and interests of                               
              the returned Chinese students viable, providing                                
              potential for longer term collaboration. This                                  
              project is supported under the US-China                                        
              Cooperative Research Program.
