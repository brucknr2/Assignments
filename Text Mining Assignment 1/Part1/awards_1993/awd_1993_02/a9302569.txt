Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Every four years, the International Congress of the History of                 
              Science is convened.  This 19th meeting is being held in Zaragoza              
              Spain from August 22 to 29.  This award partially supports the                 
              international travel costs of at least 23 American researchers in              
              the fields of history of science and technology and the social                 
              studies of science and technology.                                             
                                                                                             
              US researchers play a disproportionately large role in the                     
              development of science and technology studies today.  It is                    
              important that the strength and vitality of US scholarship be                  
              demonstrated at these meetings.  More important, however, is the               
              chance to expose US researchers to the leading researchers in                  
              science and technology studies from Europe, Asia, Africa and South             
              America.  Spain provides an ideal site for such an international               
              meeting at a time when the discovery by Europeans of new worlds is             
              being reflected upon.  The exchange of ideas and approaches among              
              international scholars and the professional contacts which will be             
              established at this meeting promise to enliven and strength                    
              research around the world.
