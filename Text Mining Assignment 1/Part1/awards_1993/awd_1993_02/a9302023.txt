Abstract    :
              This research involves the use of mathematical models and analysis to study 
              problems arising in materials research.  Three specific projects are to be 
              studied.  The first concerns the dynamical behavior of large droplets of one 
              phase immersed in a second.  The second project is a study of a recent model of
               aerogels.  And the third project is a study of some problems of first passage 
              percolation.  This research involves the use of mathematical models and
              analysis to study  problems arising in materials research.  While the problems
              arise in materials  research, new mathematics will need to be developed to
              study these problems.  In  particular, tools from functional analysis and
              probability will be useful.
