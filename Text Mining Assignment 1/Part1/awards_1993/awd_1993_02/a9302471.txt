Abstract    :
              The Ontong Java Plateau is the largest oceanic plateau in                      
              the world.  The P.I.s propose to carry out systematic field                    
              sampling and a detailed petrographic, chemical, Nd-Sr-Pb                       
              isotopic, and 40Ar-39Ar investigation of a >2000 m-thick                       
              tract of plateau basement exposed on the island of Malaita                     
              in the Solomon Islands.  To complement this work, the P.I.s                    
              will also study a suite of lavas (collected previously by                      
              the Solomon Islands Geological Survey) from other basement                     
              exposures along a  300-km-long zone in southern Malaita and                    
              the neighboring islands of Small Malaita and Santa Isabel.                     
              The results will extend knowledge gained from drilling by                      
              providing a deep, stratigraphically controlled record of                       
              mantle source, age, and petrogenesis, and a wide spatial                       
              coverage of basement age and compositional variations over a                   
              much broader region.
