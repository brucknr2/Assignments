Abstract    :
              Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles that originated in the                
                                                                                            
              mid-Triassic and rapidly diversified into all of the large-bodied              
                                                                                             
              terrestrial vertebrate ecological niches in the Late Triassic and              
                                                                                             
              dominated this landscape for 150 million years.  One of the largest            
                                                                                             
              controversies surrounding the dinosaurs were whether they were                 
              "warm-blooded" (high metabolic endotherms) or "cold-blooded" (low              
                                                                                             
              metabolic ectotherms).  This study is to determine the thermal                 
              physiology in terrrestrial vertebrates, using oxygen isotopes to               
                                                                                             
              unlock the thermal physiology of Permian and Triassic terrestrial
