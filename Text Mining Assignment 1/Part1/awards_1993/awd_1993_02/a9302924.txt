Abstract    :
              9302924  Adeyiga  Hampton University requests support from NSF for an upgrade of
              its  connection of its campus network to VERnet from a speed of 56,000  bits
              per second to one for 1.5 million bits per second.    VERnet is the midlevel
              network located in the state of Virginia.   VERnet will provide operations
              management and information services  and it will give Hampton University a
              connection to the NSFNET, a  high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
              National Backbone  network.    The University needs greater functionality and
              network speed to be  able to access supercomputer, libraries, and make file
              transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a
              unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
