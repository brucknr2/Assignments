Abstract    :
                Kosaka  9303013    This is the second year of a three-year collaborative
              project  between Monmouth College and New York University seeks to gather 
              correspondences between expressions in source and target parallel  corpora in
              Japanese and English with the objective of generalizing  these correspondences
              to create rules for use in a translation  system.  The performance of
              translation systems has been often  limited to a great extent by our ability to
              encode information  about such correspondences manually.  In this project the
              texts in  the source and target languages are parsed and then syntactically 
              regularized, producing regularized parse trees.  A tree-matching  procedure
              aligns the corresponding trees from the source and target  texts, producing a
              set of detailed correspondences between source  and target structures.  A set
              of sublanguage (semantic) word  classes is then defined and these
              correspondences are generalized  to the extent possible using these word
              classes; the result is a  set of rules for the transfer phase of a translation
              system.  The  approach uses corresponding programming language manuals written
              in  Japanese and English.
