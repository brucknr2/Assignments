              Oxidation As A Sink For Seep And Hydrate Methane In The Coastal                
              Ocean                                                                          
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The major objective of this research is to measure the removal                 
              rates of CH4 and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) released from                 
              hydrocarbon seeps, saline seeps, brine pools and hydrate outcrops              
              in the Gulf of Mexico.While invertebrate internal organs containing            
              symbiotic methane oxidizers have been previously shown to be                   
              intense sites of CH4 oxidation in these environments, this study               
              will concentrate on CH4 and NMHC oxidation occurring in the water              
              column, in sediments and on invertebrate external surfaces at such             
              sites. CH4 and NMHC oxidation rates will be determined by measuring            
              14CH4 and 14C2H6 uptake.  The role of CH4 and NMHC oxidation in                
              carbon cycling and local productivity will also be investigated.               
              Specifically, the contribution of oxidation to the production of               
              utilizable organic carbon, in the form of methanotrophic biomass,              
              which is available to the benthic community in the immediate                   
              vicinity of these sites will be estimated by measuring the fraction            
              of labelled CH4 or C2H6 which is incorporated into cell carbon.                
              This study will allow a better assessment of the role of oxidation             
              in removing CH4 and NMHC released from seeps and hydrates into the             
              coastal ocean and identify the major sites where oxidation occurs.
