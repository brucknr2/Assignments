Abstract    :
              Jones  9302584       This mathematical research project will focus on the 
              approximation of complex valued functions of a complex variable.   The work
              centers on the use of rational interpolation by Pade  approximates.  These are
              rational functions which match the power  series of specific functions at two
              or more points.  Within this  framework investigations will be carried out on
              the indeterminate  strong Stieltjes moment problem and the associated
              orthogonal  Laurent polynomials, on applications of Szego polynomials to 
              digital signal processing and the convergence of Pade continued  fractions
              relative to classical special functions including  truncation error analysis. 
              Finally, a comprehensive survey of  continued fraction representations of
              mathematical functions  along with a guide to their computation will be
              prepared.  Large  scale computation will be done for experiments in search of 
              general properties that can be proven and for graphical and  numerical
              illustration of the convergence behavior of rational  approximants.       In
              many scientific applications, the relevant functions are  not computable by
              elementary methods.  Approximation theory, as  exemplified by this project,
              seeks to establish and catalogue  methods for approximating more or less
              general functions by means  of specific, easily computable substitutes.  It is
              important that  the methods developed also provide error analysis and, where 
              possible, algorithms for efficient implementation of the  approximations.  ***
