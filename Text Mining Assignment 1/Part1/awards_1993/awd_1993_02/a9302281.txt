Abstract    :
              9302281 Bosscher The objectives of this proposal are to advance the
              understanding of the interface behavior based on micro structural studies and
              to develop a quantitative theory and a constitutive law capturing the physics
              of the interface behavior. The constitutive law will be couched as an
              incremental history dependent law applicable for numerical simulation. The
              quantitative theory will be developed based on experimentation and the use of
              distinct element method (DEM) simulations. The use of massive parallelization
              of the DEM code will enhance the number of particles and the complexity of
              particles and surfaces that can be modeled. Experimental verification of the
              derived interface constitutive law will also be performed. ***
