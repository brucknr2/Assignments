Abstract    :
              9302265  Kerr         This project provides a broad-band Fabry-Perot
              Spectrometer  (FPS) for use at the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Radar 
              Optical Facility.  The FPS is used for experiments by investigators  at remote
              sites.  The instrument is transportable, and is also  available for
              campaign-based use at other CEDAR facilities.  This  proposal requests funding
              to support a full-time graduate student  to fuse collaborative cooperation
              between the Boston University  optical complement and the MIT radar and optical
              complement at  Millstone Hill, and for travel of that student between these
              sites.  ***
