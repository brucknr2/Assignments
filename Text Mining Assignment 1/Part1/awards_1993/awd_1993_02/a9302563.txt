Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Trace Elements In The Overflow Waters Of The North Atlantic                    
                                                                                             
              The investigators will participate in the 1993 IOC sponsored                   
              baseline cruise in the North Atlantic.  This cruise will conduct a             
              detailed sampling and trace element characterization of the                    
              northern overflow waters at the various sills in the area of the               
              Denmark Strait and Iceland Scotland Ridge as well as their                     
              downstream mixing products.  This sampling opportunity will be used            
              to extend the investigations of AL and Be geochemistry to the                  
              source regions of the various components of the North Atlantic Deep            
              Water.  In addition it is proposed to commence a detailed study of             
              the geochemistry of dissolved Fe in this region using a new on-                
              board measurement technique.
