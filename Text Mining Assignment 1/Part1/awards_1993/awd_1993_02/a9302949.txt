Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              UNIAX has developed a series of ester-substituted soluble                      
              poly(para-phenylenes) PPP for use as active layers in blue and                 
              violet light emitting diodes (LEDs).  The synthetic route is                   
              simple, conducive to large scale, and allows for a wide variety of             
              derivatives - making other routes into blue luminescent conducting             
              polymers seem awkward or obsolete.  Derivatives have been tailored             
              to have solubility in non-polar solvents such as hexane or in polar            
              solvents such as ethanol.  Films spun-cast directly from solution              
              are pinhole-free and transparent, but take on a violet or blue hue             
              in reflected sunlight.  Photoluminescent spectra for all                       
              derivatives prepared are reported (luminescence energies for some              
              derivates exceed 3.0 eV), and the fabrication of a prototypes LED              
              device using one of these stable room-temperature processible PPP              
              derivatives has been achieved.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The goal in developing this preliminary research into a                        
              commercially attractive portable display involves purification of              
              the conducting polymer active layers to optimize the efficiency,               
              and to systematically investigate diode characteristics                        
              (efficiency, or "brightness," and light emission turn-on voltage)              
              as a function of active layer thickness, nature of the transparent             
              electrode contact, and nature of the metal electron-injecting                  
              contact.  The research will also include research into synthesizing            
              a green luminescent PPP, making use of the finding that electron-              
              releasing groups red-shift the luminescence.
