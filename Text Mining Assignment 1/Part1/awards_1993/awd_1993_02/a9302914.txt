Abstract    :
              The proposed research investigates manifestations of the                       
              neutron-quadrupole proton-quadrupole vibrational mode in the                   
              spherical nuclei 142Ce, 144Nd, and 120Te.  Experiments will be                 
              performed at the University of Kentucky Nuclear Structure                      
              Laboratory and examine y-ray emission following inelastic neutron              
              scattering on the nuclei of interest.  A three-year research                   
              program involving nuclear scientists from the U. S. Naval                      
              Academy, the University of Dallas and the University of Kentucky               
              is proposed.  This proposal is designed to include active                      
              participation by undergraduate students, in the research effort.
