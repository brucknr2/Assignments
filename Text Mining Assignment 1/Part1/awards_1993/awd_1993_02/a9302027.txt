Abstract    :
              9302027  Cenkl       A conference in algebraic topology will be held at 
              Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, June 22-27, 1993.   The main
              focus will be on modern homotopy theory.  The conference  will be accessible to
              graduate students and other young scientists  in this field.  Members of
              traditionally underrepresented groups  will be encouraged to attend.  It will
              represent an important  opportunity for all to meet with the leaders in the
              subject.  The  main topics will be two areas which have experienced spectacular
               growth over the past few years: the chromatic perspective on stable  homotopy
              theory (the telescope conjecture, Picard groups,  axiomatics of structured ring
              spectra), and unstable homotopy  theory (localizations, finite loop spaces,
              loop spaces of finite  complexes, algebraic homotopy theory).       Topology
              concerns itself with aspects of geometric spaces and  structures which remain
              unchanged by continuous transformations.   Dimension, connectedness (being all
              in one piece), the properties  of being knotted or linked, and many more, all
              are subjects of  topological study, for they are preserved so long as cutting
              or  tearing are not permitted despite quite drastic alteration of shape  and
              size.  It is clear that these are fundamental and significant  properties but
              that their study requires different tools from those  of ordinary analytic
              geometry to make them manageable and a subject  for calculation.  Algebraic
              topology is devoted to developing,  understanding, and applying these tools,
              and homotopy is one of the  most powerful and complex tools in the arsenal.
