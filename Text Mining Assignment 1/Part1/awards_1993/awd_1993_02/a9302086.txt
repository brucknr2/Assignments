Abstract    :
              9302086  Torr         Under a previous award, a new photometric technique was 
              developed which allows observations of weak airglow signals to be  observed in
              the daytime.  Such measurements made at twilight  provide a means of retrieving
              thermospheric composition and  temperature and a scaling factor for the solar
              EUV flux.  A  prototype of the instrument was designed, fabricated and tested. 
               In the continuing award, tests will be conducted with the  instrument in
              Huntsville, Alabama, and at McDonald Observatory, in  Texas.  This will allow
              assessment of the effects due to the  underlying water vapor absorption
              features which are not as severe  in the arid climate at McDonald.  These
              measurements will provide  important information for the interpretation of
              atmospheric  composition and temperature data.  ***
