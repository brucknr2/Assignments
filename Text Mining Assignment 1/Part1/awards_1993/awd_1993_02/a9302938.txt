Abstract    :
              9302938  Chronopoulos  This project will study the performance of numerical
              schemes  which combine approximate inertial manifolds with variable  step
              numerical integration.  Special emphasis will be given to  manifolds which are
              defined only implicitly, and which result  in systems of differential algebraic
              equations.  This research  is expected to lead to stable and efficient
              computational  methods for determining the long-time behavior of solutions to 
              certain dissipative nonlinear partial differential equations.   Application
              will be made to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and 2-D  Navier-Stokes equations.  ***
