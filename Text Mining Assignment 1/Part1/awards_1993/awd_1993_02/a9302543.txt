Abstract    :
                   Research is proposed in three areas of complex geometry and               
              several complex variables: characterizations up to biholomorphic               
              isometry of classical bounded symmetric domains and their duals                
              via solution of a partial differential equation, a version of the              
              Schwarzian derivative for locally biholomorphic maps between                   
              manifolds with projective structure, and convexity of complex                  
              manifolds with respect to sections of a holomorphic line bundle.
