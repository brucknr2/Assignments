Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Science Foundation (NSF) operates three permanent                 
              research stations in the Antarctic. One of these, Palmer Station,              
              is visited by over one thousand tourists per year, traveling by                
              ship during the relatively mild Antarctic summer. This action                  
              will support development  of an interpretive, educational program              
              for presentation to visitors at Palmer Station, focusing on the                
              natural environment around the station as well as research                     
              activities supported by NSF. It also includes services of a                    
              National Park Service interpretive specialist at the station for               
              a period not to exceed eight weeks during the current season.
