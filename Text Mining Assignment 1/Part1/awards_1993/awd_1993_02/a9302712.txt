Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with research into the internal                   
              structure and representation theory of certain associative                     
              algebras that are of current interest within mathematical physics              
              and Lie representation theory, namely quantum groups and                       
              enveloping algebras of Lie superalgebras.  The quantum groups to               
              be studied are the quantized coordinate rings of algebraic                     
              groups; the Lie superalgebras which will be considered are the                 
              classical simple and solvable ones.  The focus throughout will be              
              on prime and primitive ideal theory, and the principle methods                 
              involve new induction techniques for ring extensions.                          
                   Quantum groups are a new area of research for both                        
              mathematicians and physicists.  On the mathematical side, it                   
              combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics,                      
              algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest to                 
              physicists working on conformal quantum field theory.
