Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The observations of the middle and upper atmosphere that can              
              be made at Bear Lake Observatory are vital to the CEDAR objectives             
              of studying coupling among different regions of the atmosphere.                
              Mid-latitude observations provide a very different perspective of              
              coupling compared to those made in the auroral zone and polar cap              
              or in the equatorial region.  There are two categories of problems             
              that are particularly amenable to study from a mid-latitude site,              
              and these are being pursued from BLO.  The first studies                       
              atmospheric processes where the influence of magnetospheric                    
              processes are minimal.  The other studies extensions of                        
              magnetospheric influences into the mid-latitude region, which may              
              occur from an expansion of the auroral region towards the equator              
              or from enhancements of ring-current effects extending poleward.
