Abstract    :
              The use of second harmonic generation will be developed by                     
              Professor Corn to investigate the structure and dynamics of                    
              several important interfacial systems in this research project                 
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.                     
              Studies of liquid-liquid interfaces will combine the SHG method                
              with standard surface tension and electrochemical measurements                 
              to determine molecular adsorption and structure at the                         
              interface.  Self assembled zirconium alkyl phosphonate layers                  
              will also be examined using SHG and vibrational spectroscopic                  
              methods, to determine molecular orientation within the                         
              interfacial layer.  The molecular structural information                       
              obtained in these studies will be used to design and control                   
              the macroscopic properties of the interface.

              This research project will combine state of the art non-linear                 
              optical methods such as second harmonic generation to probe the                
              detailed molecular structure of several technologically                        
              important interfacial systems.  Liquid-liquid interfaces,                      
              self-assembled zirconium alkly phosphonate monolayers, and                     
              electrochemical surfaces will be examined.  The results of this                
              research will provide the understanding essential to the                       
              rational design of interfacial systems.
