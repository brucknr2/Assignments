Abstract    :
              9302034  Singelmann  This  U.S.-Mexico award will support a  workshop  on  the
              sociological perspectives of labor markets.  The  workshop, organized by
              Professors Joachim Singelmann  and  Charles  Tolbert of Louisiana State
              University,  and  Professors  Humberto Munoz of  the  Universidad  Autonoma
              Nacional de Mexico (UNAM) and Orlandina  de  Oliveira  of  the El Colegio de
              Mexico,  will  bring  together  scholars  with expertise  in  quantitative 
              measures  of  labor market areas and in  case  study  approaches.   The primary
              objective of the  workshop  is to build collaborative ventures in both
              countries  that will enhance opportunities for joint research.    Though  labor
               market  research  programs  are  well  established  in  both  Mexico  and  the
               U.S.,   the  research traditions on both sides of the border  are  very 
              different.   The  Mexican  approach  primarily  consists of rich case studies
              of local market areas,  whereas  the U.S. research tradition has  emphasized 
              broad   labor  market  areas  that  can   serve   as  statistical units of
              analysis  While the Mexican and  the U.S. approach are complementary, there
              have been  few   attempts  to  combine  their  perspective   in  comparative 
              work.   This workshop  will  contribute  toward  that  goal by bringing
              together Mexican  and  U.S.  sociologists to discuss collaboration on labor 
              market  research.  This cooperation is  critical  if  the social science
              communities of both countries are  to  monitor  and  assess the effects  of 
              the  North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  ***
