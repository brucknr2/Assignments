Abstract    :
                      9302222  Haas  The work envisioned will extend the manipulator machine's
               capabilities and utility by demonstrating feasibility for more  general
              material handling applications involving truck loading and  unloading and steel
              erection.  The incorporation of additional  control system features should
              allow for use of the manipulator in  a teach-learning mode which would reduce
              the requirement for  operator attention during routine repetitive operations
              and allow  demonstration of the task and path planning demonstrated in the 
              simulation studies already completed.  In achieving these  objectives,
              fundamental knowledge about extending the functionality  of large scale
              manipulators in construction will be possible.
