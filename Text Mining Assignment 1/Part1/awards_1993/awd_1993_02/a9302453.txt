Abstract    :
              Dr. Donald H. Burke has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                   
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Burke's doctoral degree was from                  
              the University of California/Berkeley under the supervision of                 
              Professor John Hearst. Dr. Burke will continue his research at                 
              the University of Colorado at Boulder under the sponsorship of                 
              Professor Larry Gold. Dr. Burke's postdoctoral training will                   
              provide him with the skills necesary to isolate and analyze RNA                
              molecules with interesting chemical and catalytic properties.                  
              Longer term, Dr. Burke will study RNA catalysts for reactions                  
              germane to prebiotic chemistry. Specifically, catalysts will be                
              sought for each of the classes of reactions represented by the                 
              citric acid cycle, including condensations, hydrations,                        
              dehydrations, decarboxylations, oxidations and substrate-level                 
              phosphorylations.                                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
