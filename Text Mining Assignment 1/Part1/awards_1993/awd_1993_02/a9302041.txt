Abstract    :
                   This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The             
              research addresses recovering the 3D shape of an object from its 2D            
              image contour.  Existing 3D shape recovery algorithms tend to rely             
              on parametric models to uniquely constrain the underlying 3D                   
              surface.   Often, real-world scenes are too general to describe                
              using parametric models.  This researcher has discovered that                  
              certain non-parametric shape models allow a much greater flexibilty            
              while at the same time providing constraints that can be used in               
              the shape recovery process. Using planar symmetry as a model, the              
              PI has constructed a symmetry analyzer, SYMAN, that finds axes of              
              symmetry from contour. In addition, he has developed algorithms                
              that use symmetry and orthogonality as object-based heuristics to              
              constrain or recover 3D shape from image contour.  With this award,            
              the research is extended to mathematical study of the surface and              
              projective properties of curved symmetric surfaces as well as their            
              application to the shape recovery problem, and use of                          
              "crystallographic" methods to describe and recover shape by viewing            
              classes of shapes with similar structure as being equivalent, so               
              that all "octally symmetric" objects (e.g., spheres, cubes,                    
              superquadrics) might be considered equivalent.
