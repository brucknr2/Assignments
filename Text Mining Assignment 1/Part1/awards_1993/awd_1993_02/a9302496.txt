Abstract    :
              Murray  9302496    The PIs will use faunal, geochemical and stable-isotopic data
              to  reconstruct climatic changes in the Indian Ocean between 12 and 3.5  Ma
              utilizing ODP core material. The study will lead to delineation  of surface
              temperature gradients, productivity, and the signature  of biogenic
              sedimentation. It will also provide a time series of  monsoonal upwellinmg in
              the northwestern Indian Ocean that may be  associated with the uplift of the
              Himalayas and the Tibetan  Plateau.
