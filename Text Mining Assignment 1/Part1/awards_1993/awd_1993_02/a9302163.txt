Abstract    :
                   St. Ambrose University requests support from NSF for                      
              connection of its campus to CICnet as an affiliate member through              
              the University of Iowa.  CICNet is the midlevel network located in             
              this part of the state of Iowa that will provide operations and                
              network information services.  It will give the colleges a 56                  
              thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed                
              (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.                  
                   The colleges need greater functionality and network speed to              
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
