Abstract    :
              Scott M. LeGrand has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. LeGrand's doctoral degree was from                
              the Pennsylvania State University under the supervision of                     
              Professor Kenneth Merz. Dr. Le Grand will continue research at                 
              UCLA under the sponsorship of Professor David Eisenberg. Dr.                   
              LeGrand's postdoctoral training will provide him with the                      
              skills necessary to develop innovative approaches to tertiary                  
              DNA structure prediction and specifically algorithms for the                   
              protein folding problem. Longer term, he plans to study the use                
              of an evolutionary arms race to develop knowledge-based                        
              potential functions for protein tertiary structure prediction.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
