Abstract    :
              9302173  Gladfelter       At the core of all materials research is the need to
              know  composition and structure.  These determine the physical properties  and
              may reflect the synthesis and processing history of the  materials.  Rutherford
              backscattering (RBS) and forward recoil  spectrometry (FRES) are two powerful
              tools for establishing the  compositions and depth profiles of thin films. 
              Several programs at  the University of Minnesota will make use of this RBS
              System,  including a) using RBS to evaluate diffusion processes in olivine 
              that may contribute to movement of material in the earth's mantle,  b) using
              RBS to characterize compositions of high temperature  superconducting metal
              oxide films c) using RBS to characterize  chemical reactions that occur at
              interfaces and control the  fracture mechanics of the films, d) using FRES to
              quantify the  hydrogen (or deuterium) content of films grown from
              organometallic  precursors, e) using FRES to study diffusion of polymers.  ***
