              Ocean                                                                          
                                                                                             
              This research will investigate the speciation, distribution and                
              biogeochemical cycling of Hg in the North Atlantic Ocean. The ocean            
              is an important source and sink for atmospheric Hg, and plays a                
              significant role in the global Hg cycle. Knowledge of the behavior             
              and fate of Hg in the marine environment is hindered by the lack of            
              information on the distribution and speciation of Hg in open ocean             
              regions. The Intergovernment Oceanographic Commission (IOC)                    
              Baseline Trace Metal cruise aboard the C.S.S. Hudson in June/July              
              1993 will provide essential data, as well as the supporting                    
              chemical and physical oceanographic program, to complement and                 
              extend previous oceanic studies of Hg, particularly those in the               
              productive equatorial Pacific Ocean. Shipboard analyses will be                
              made for reactive Hg, and dissolved gaseous species (Hg degree and             
              dimethylHg).  Post cruise analyses will be conducted for total Hg,             
              participate Hg, and for monomethylHg.  The research will focus on              
              the distribution of methylated Hg species and elemental Hg in an               
              effort to ascertain the principal sources and sinks for these                  
              compounds in the surface and deep ocean. The data obtained will                
              allow the testing of current hypotheses concerning the sources and             
              fate of Hg species in open ocean waters, and will broaden the                  
              understanding of the role of the ocean in the global Hg cycle.
