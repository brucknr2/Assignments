Abstract    :
              9302321  Queiroz  This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the 
              collaboration of Mardson Queiroz of Brigham Young University and  Joao Carvalho
              of the Brazilian National Space Research Institute  (INPE).  The project aims
              to investigate the effect of  atomization parameters (such as nozzle
              Sauter-mean diameter and  size spectrum) and frequency of oscillation on spray
              combustion  instability excitation in Rijke burners.    The researchers will
              prepare INPE's existing combustor to burn  sprays, as well as design and build
              a smaller combustor at  Brigham Young.  With an existing laser system, they
              will  characterize the spray injectors in terms of droplet mean  diameter and
              size spectrum; work on a theoretical model for  particulate behavior in a
              pulsating flow; and perform tests under  different combustor lengths (different
              frequencies of  oscillation), oxidant/fuel ratios, and mass flow rates for
              spray  nozzles with different mean droplet sizes and size spectra.  Both  the
              U.S. and Brazilian groups will benefit from new data on  liquid fuel combustion
              instability and the possible use of  results for designing high-efficiency
              liquid waste incinerators.   The project will also prepare the two groups for
              joint training  of graduate students in the two different environments.    ***
