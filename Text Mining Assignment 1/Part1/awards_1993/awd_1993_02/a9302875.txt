Abstract    :
              This award supports basic chemical, biochemical, and chemical                  
              ecological studies of a group of nonprotein amino acids, namely L-             
              canavanine and its metabolic derivatives, that function in higher              
              plant chemical defense against insects and other destructive                   
              agents.  These investigations will enhance our understanding of the            
              biochemical bases for higher plant nonprotein amino acid toxicity              
              in insects and provide valuable insight into why potentially                   
              protective allelochemicals fail to elicit deleterious effects.                 
                                                                                             
              Just as it is critically important to know how toxic                           
              allelochemicals function to protect a plant, so too must we                    
              understand insect capacity to deal with toxic natural products.  An            
              understanding of the metabolic resources that an insect uses to                
              avoid or detoxify pernicious plant allelochemicals is of basic                 
              importance in any future use of these compounds in insect control.             
              No single investigation by itself can achieve this practical aim.              
              Nevertheless, it is critically important to select a model system              
              about which we have a basic and detailed understanding and to use              
              it to consider this question in a sound and thorough manner.  This             
              approach can provide data essential to the eventual achievement of             
              this pragmatic goal.
