Abstract    :
                   Milman will study several related topics from the local                   
              theory of Banach spaces and the theory of convex bodies in R^n.                
              Among them, volume estimates in finite dimensional normed spaces,              
              random coordinate subspaces and existence of quotient spaces with              
              good cotype constants.                                                         
                   Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that                      
              attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the                       
              structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The                
              axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more                    
              relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the                    
              "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a result,                
              the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.  Much of                 
              the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory               
              of Banach spaces.
