Abstract    :
              This project addresses two major problems in geology: (a) the                  
              tectonic setting and crustal conditions for 1.4 GA "anorogenic"                
              granites and (b) processes of pluton emplacement, the so-called                
              "room problem" for granites.  These topics will be addressed                   
              through a multidisciplinary field, structural and petrologic                   
              investigation of well-exposed 1.4 Ga plutons and associated                    
              metamorphic aureoles in central Arizona.  Due to the complex                   
              interplay among heat, transport, metamorphism, and deformation                 
              during plutonism, it is necessary to collect both petrologic and               
                                                                                             
              structural data (at a variety of scales) in order to decipher the              
                                                                                             
              tectonic framework of the magmatic event.  Results will lead to                
              fundamental changes in models for Middle Proterozoic tectonic                  
              evolution of North America and Scandinavia in addition to                      
              fundamental constraints on mechanisms of crustal growth and                    
              reactivation during pluton emplacement.
