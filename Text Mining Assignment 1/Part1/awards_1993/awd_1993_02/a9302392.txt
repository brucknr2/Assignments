Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will continue operation of the WOCE (World             
              Ocean Circulation Experiment) Data Information Unit (DIU).  WOCE is            
              a worldwide, international program, with dispersed data holdings,              
              and principal investigators in many countries.  The DIU serves as              
              an information center for WOCE, provides the means for tracking                
              WOCE data sets, and acts as a central activity to stimulate the                
              development of the WOCE data management system.  Activities of the             
              DIU include operation of an existing on-line information center,               
              organizing information about data sets valuable to WOCE, providing             
              information necessary for effective WOCE data management, and                  
              maintaining information about program standards and formats.                   
              During the coming year, scientists at the DIU will add improvements            
              to the data-tracking system and explore the possibility of creating            
              an integrated WOCE data set.
