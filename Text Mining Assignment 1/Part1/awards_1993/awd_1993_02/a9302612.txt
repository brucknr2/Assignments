Abstract    :
              ABAG recently developed estimates of uninhabitable dwellings                   
              in future earthquakes affecting the San Francisco Bay Area.                    
              George Washington University used these estimates in                           
              developing projections of shelter populations in future                        
              earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay Area.                                     
                                                                                             
              This project expands these efforts by more systematically                      
              examining data on the residential structures tagged by local                   
              government building officials as unsafe (red) or limited                       
              access (yellow) following the Loma Prieta earthquake in                        
              accordance with the ATC20-California Office of Emergency                       
              Services procedures for postearthquake safety evaluation of                    
              buildings.  The data on daily occupancy load of Red Cross                      
              shelters following that earthquake also are examined.                          
                                                                                             
              The project has five principal objectives: (1) develop                         
              models of housing habitability based on intensity, distance                    
              from fault source, and underlying geologic materials for the                   
              San Francisco Bay Area; (2) model how shelter populations                      
              are related to structural damage, including data on                            
              buildings that are redtagged as uninhabitable, as well as                      
              yellow-tagged as damaged based on actual Loma Prieta data;                     
              (3) assess the demographic characteristics of the shelter                      
              population versus the overall impacted population through                      
              use of the 1990 Census (conducted only five months after the                   
              earthquake) and Red Cross data from the Loma Prieta event;                     
              (4) relate the recovery time of the impacted housing stock                     
              to the structural type of those buildings for Loma Prieta;                     
              and (5) apply these lessons to future Bay Area earthquakes.                    
                                                                                             
              The goal of the project is to improve the nation's emergency                   
              planning, disaster response and residential rebuilding                         
              efforts in future earthquakes.
