Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI requests funding to purchase instrumentation that will be               
              operated as shared-use equipment for deep oceanographic research.              
              The instruments requested, upgrades to a CCD camera, will be used              
              aboard the submersible ALVIN and, potentially, aboard remotely                 
              operated vehicles (ROVs).  The requested upgrades include a new CCD            
              chip with greater sensitivity, increased light sources for ALVIN,              
              a video lens with a greater field of view, and improved software               
              that will increase the data acquisition rate.  These upgrades will             
              enhance the performance of the CCD camera to produce comprehensive,            
              high-resolution digital photomosaics of the seafloor. Acquisition              
              of a camera system with these capabilities was identified as a high            
              priority for the Deep Submergence Science Committee (DESSC) which              
              oversees the operation of ALVIN and other research ROVs.  The                  
              instrumentation requested will enhance a wide variety of NSF-funded            
              scientific research.
