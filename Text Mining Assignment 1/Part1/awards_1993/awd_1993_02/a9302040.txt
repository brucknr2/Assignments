Abstract    :
              9302040  Crimp       It is proposed to purchase a field emission gun scanning 
              electron microscope (FEG SEM) equipped with digital image  processing which
              will be dedicated to support research in materials  engineering.  This
              equipment will be fitted with a electron  channelling contrast imaging (ECCI)
              imaging system currently being  constructed in conjunction with a National
              Science Foundation Young  Investigator Award.  The FEG-SEM equipped with the
              ECCI system,  which will be the first facility of its type in the United
              States,  will be used for several research projects which require 
              microcrystalline analysis, but are not possible with conventional  transmission
              electron microscopy (TEM), in particular:   Intrinsically brittle materials,
              including intermetallic alloys  will be examined using bulk samples deformed
              in-situ to determine  the nature of the dislocation generation and motion at
              and near the  crack tip zone.  Other research programs will also use the ECCI 
              capability for a wide range of materials investigations including 
              microstructure morphologies in polymer matrix composites,  interfacial
              characterization of intermetallic matrix composites and  compliant layer
              coatings, and damage accumulation studies at  fracture surfaces.  Additionally,
              the FEG SEM has advantages over  conventional W and LaB6 electron source SEMs,
              such as greater  resolutions (1.5 nm) and the ability to examine non-conducting
               materials at low voltages without the need to apply a conductive  coating. 
              Numerous researchers throughout the Department of  Materials Science and
              Mechanics, and Michigan State University will  use these advantages to enhance
              their materials research.  ***
