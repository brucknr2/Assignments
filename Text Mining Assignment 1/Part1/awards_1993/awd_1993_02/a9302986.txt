Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to investigate the chaotic                   
              behavior of several important types of dynamical systems.  The                 
              systems involved in the study include several classes of complex               
              dynamical systems, namely the exponential and the standard                     
              family, an important class of systems arising in physics.  The                 
              investigation will also involve several related families,                      
              including area-preserving and piecewise linear maps.  Finally,                 
              the tricorn, an important new fractal structure, will be                       
              described.
