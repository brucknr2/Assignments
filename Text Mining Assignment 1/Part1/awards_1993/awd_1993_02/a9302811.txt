Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the project is to provide funding for the scientific            
              analysis of data collected as part of the Tropical Instability Wave            
              Experiment (TIWE).  TIWE is a multi-institutional program aimed at             
              an improved understanding of the dynamical and thermodynamical                 
              transfers that occur between these waves and the background                    
              currents.  The field work commenced in the central equatorial                  
              Pacific during the spring of 1990.  The University of South Florida            
              portion consisted of a five element array of subsurface-moored                 
              acoustic Doppler current profilers, monitoring currents over the               
              upper 250 m of the water column from May 1990 to June 1991.  A 100%            
              data return was achieved, the data have been edited, a data report             
              has been disseminated and scientific analyses are underway.  These             
              analysis bear upon the kinematics, dynamics, energetics, and                   
              thermodynamics of the instability waves and their interaction with             
              the background currents.  Additional analysis aims at an improved              
              understanding of the evolution of the three-dimensional flow field             
              on the equator in the central Pacific.
