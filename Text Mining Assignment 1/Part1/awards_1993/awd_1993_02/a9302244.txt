Abstract    :
                9302244  Snodgrass    This is the first year funding of a three-year
              continuing award.   Many emerging applications, including geographical
              information  systems and scientific databases, such as those associated with 
              global change studies, require simultaneous support for spatial and  temporal
              data.  This project considers three areas where previously  proposed approaches
              for handling space or time separately need to  be generalized to produce a
              coherent approach to spatiotemporal  (ST) database.  The first issue is the
              design of ST databases.   Database administrators use a data model to describe
              the enterprise  to be modeled.  A conceptual data model used in temporal
              databases  that employs sets of time instants is being merged with the point 
              set model used in spatial databases.  The second issue is that of  query
              processing, specifically efficient execution of ST natural  joins and ST
              aggregates.  Extensions of currently proposed temporal  query processing
              methods are under development.  Finally, ST  indeterminacy, or "don't know
              exactly where or when" information,  must be handled.  Again, the merged data
              model is quite helpful, as  it is possible to model indeterminacy in this model
              as sets of  possible instants and points.  The result will be enhanced methods 
              of designing ST databases and implementing ST database management  systems, in
              which time and space support is balanced and  coordinated.   ***
