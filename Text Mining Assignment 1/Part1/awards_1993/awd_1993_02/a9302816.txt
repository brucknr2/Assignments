Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will continue analysis and synthesis of              
              data they obtained, in cooperation with a number of other PI's,                
              during the SYNoptic Ocean Prediction (SYNOP) experiment in the                 
              Gulf Stream system east of Cape Hatteras from late 1987 to mid-                
              1990.  Principal focus in this study will be on data from the                  
              Central Array near 68|W.  Issues to be addressed include Gulf                  
              Stream structure and kinematics, deep cyclogenesis, coherent                   
              eddies, and propagation of fluctuation energy down-stream past                 
              Cape Hatteras.
