Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The plate boundary between the Easter and Juan Fernandez                       
              microplates appears to have the fastest known spreading rate on                
              East Pacific Rise. The lack of transform faults suggests that a                
              possible threshold spreading rate above which the classic spreading            
              center/transform fault configuration is not stable.  A proposed                
              GLORIA/hydrosweep survey of this area will determine its present               
              geometry and its tectonic evolution over the past 4.8 m.y.
