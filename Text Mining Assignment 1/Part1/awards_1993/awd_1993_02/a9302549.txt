Abstract    :
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography will undertake an Ocean                    
              Sciences instrumentation development project to design and                     
              construct an integrated capture and aquarium system for obtaining,             
              studying, and maintaining live deep-sea animals.  Components of the            
              system will include a variable-ballast float package that will be              
              capable of lowering and raising the aquarium to full ocean depth,              
              pressure-retaining traps outfitted with observation ports for                  
              viewing animals inside, a deep-sea camera system for monitoring                
              trap performance on the sea floor, plus necessary mechanical and               
              electronic systems for keeping the water within the aquarium at                
              high pressure and cold temperature once the system is recovered.               
              Progress in the study of deep sea organisms is being impeded by a              
              lack of ability to capture them and study them while alive.  This              
              aquarium system will meet this requirement and open up new areas               
              for deep sea biological research.
