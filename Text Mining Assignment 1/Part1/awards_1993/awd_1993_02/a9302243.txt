Abstract    :
              A field study of the variability of the North Atlantic Deep Western  Boundary
              Current (DWBC) will be conducted using a combination of  experimental
              approaches: hydrography, chemical tracers and  Lagrangian floats. The main
              objectives of the study are to  determine the synoptic velocity and water mass
              structure of the  DWBC and determine the fluid parcel pathways in the DWBC and 
              identify the regions of exchange with the interior.
