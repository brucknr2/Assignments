Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs propose to use the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric            
              Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure to derive ionospheric conductance,            
              electric filed, current and Joule heating maps for three disturbed             
              equinox periods:  20-21 March 1990, 23-28 March 1991 and 28-29                 
              March 1992.  The first period is a Coupling Energetics and Dynamics            
              of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) storm study interval for which we               
              have begun initial data collection.  The second period is one of               
              considerable geophysical interest because it follows one of the                
              largest flare events of solar cycle 22.  Three Defense                         
              Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites observed                    
              particle and field variations during this interval.  For this                  
              interval the PIs will also acquire selected Fabry-Perot optical                
              data and geosynchronous magnetospheric plasma analyzer data which              
              we intend to correlate with high latitude-electrodynamic patterns.             
              Considerable data also exist for the 28-29 March 1992 interval                 
              which was a Geospace Environmental Modelling (GEM) observational               
              campaign.  Because four DMSP spacecraft were operating during March            
              1992, the interval has the potential of producing the most                     
              comprehensive data set ever assembled for the study of large scale             
              electrodynamic linkages from the solar wind to the magnetosphere,              
              the ionosphere and ultimately to the neutral atmosphere.                       
                                                                                             
                   As in previous studies data will be acquired from DMSP                    
              particle and field measurements, NOAA particle measurements,                   
              Incoherent Scatter Radars, Coherent High Frequency Radars, and                 
              ground magnetic observatories from both hemispheres.  These data               
              will be assimilated to produce electric potential field                        
              distributions, horizontal and field-aligned current distributions              
              and Joule heating and conductance distributions.                               
                                                                                             
                   The primary objectives for this study are:  (1) providing                 
              explanation of deviations from large scale conjugacy in equinoctial            
              convection patterns in terms of solar wind parameters, (2)                     
              documenting the temporal and spatial scale of high-latitude                    
              variations associated with significant changes of the IMF and                  
              correlating these variations with observations in the                          
              magnetosphere; (3) supporting new and ongoing coordinated storm                
              studies (CEDAR and GEM) by providing a means for interpreting local            
              observations in a global context.
