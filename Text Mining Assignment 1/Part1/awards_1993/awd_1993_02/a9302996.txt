Abstract    :
                   This proposal is concerned with the number of characters in a             
              block of a finite group.  The principal investigator will complete             
              the reduction of his conjecture on this to the case of almost                  
              simple groups.  He will also verify it for as many such groups as              
              possible and will search for a simpler direct proof of it.                     
                   The research supported concerns the representation theory of              
              finite groups.  A group is an algebraic object used to study                   
              transformations.  Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool in            
              physics, chemistry and computer science as well as mathematics.                
              Representation theory is an important method for determining the               
              structure of groups.
