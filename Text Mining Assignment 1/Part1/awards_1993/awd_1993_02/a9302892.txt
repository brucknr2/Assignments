Abstract    :
              9302892  Heydt  The project concerns electric power quality, i.e. the distortion
               of the ideal sinusoidal voltage and current voltage and current  waveshapes in
              a power system because of the presence of  electronic devices (rectifiers,
              adjustable speed machine drives,  light dimmers, power conditioners, etc.). In
              order to analyze the  impact of these load types on a power systems, it is
              generally  necessary to solve a set of differential equations at each load.  
              Computational savings would result if the transient part of the  solution could
              be skipped and only the steady-state periodic  solution found.  Computationally
              efficient solution methods are  being sought.  ***
