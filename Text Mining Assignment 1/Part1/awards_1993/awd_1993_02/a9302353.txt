Abstract    :
              9302353  Seraphin    This project is concerned with the investigation of
              micron-long  graphite fibers called nanotubes.  These nanotubes exhibit a 
              different shape compared to the initially observed spherical  fullerenes such
              as C60.  The objectives of this project are to  study:  1) the correlation
              between morphology and yield of  nanotubes and processing parameters by means
              of transmission  electron microscopy; 2) the growth mechanism of the nanotubes
              with  the aim to control the intricate balance of carbon hexagons and 
              pentagons in the cylindrical geometry of the tubes and end pieces,  and to
              tailor nanotubes of desired length-to-diameter ratio; and 3)  stability and
              structural transformations of nanotubes under the  electron beam and in-situ
              upon heating and cooling.  This research  will lay the foundations for the
              nanoscale engineering of the  tubular carbon clusters.  The project has
              technological importance  with respect to the novel mechanical and electrical
              properties  expected in properly designed nanotube-based materials.  ***
