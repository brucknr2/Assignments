Abstract    :
              This interdisciplinary research will investigate the mechanical                
              behavior of model joints in metal matrix composites and its                    
              relationship to defects and microstructural features developed                 
              during processing.  Research will focus on joint geometries                    
              commonly found in designing with advanced materials, including both            
              composite-composite and composite-monolithic combinations.  Fiber              
              coatings will be used to control the interfacial characteristics of            
              the composites and to develop an understanding of end effects in               
              weakly and strongly bonded systems.  Particular emphasis will be               
              placed on the evolution of defects and relevant microstructural                
              features during diffusion bonding, and their role in deformation               
              micromechanics and properties of the joint.  Tests will be                     
              conducted at elevated and ambient temperatures under various                   
              loading conditions and the results related to emerging constitutive            
              laws developed for monolithic and for composite materials.  This               
              research should assist in the construction of predictive models for            
              the behavior of joint systems using the principles of                          
              micromechanics and processing science.
