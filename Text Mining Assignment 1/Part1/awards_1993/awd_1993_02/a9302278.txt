Abstract    :
              The exploratory research to be performed on this SGER award will               
              investigate the fundamental relation between crack growth and                  
              background plasticity of ductile solids.  Rigorous and                         
              exceptionally accurate finite element calculations based on an                 
              innovative mathematical model will be performed to predict the                 
              fracture resistance curves, the crack growth per cycle under                   
              sequential stressing, and the interface debond length.  These                  
              results will be compared to available physical observations for                
              this class of materials.  Understanding gained from this research              
              could lead to the development of advanced high-performance                     
              composites consisting of a multitude of alternating thin layers                
              of ductile and brittle materials.
