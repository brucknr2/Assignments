Abstract    :
              This grant is for the partial support of an international (IUTAM)              
              symposium on nonlinear waves in solids to be held during August                
              15-20, 1993 at University of Victoria, Victoria, British                       
              Columbia, Canada.  The proposed symposium will allow the                       
              presentation of state-of-the-art research findings in the area of              
              nonlinear waves in solids to the leading workers in this field                 
              from academe, government laboratories and industry.  In                        
              particular, the symposium will feature presentation  concerning                
              the theory of nonlinear wave propagation in porous media and in                
              solids with microstructure; interaction of elastic waves with                  
              thermal and electromagnetic fields; and numerical methods.
