Abstract    :
              9302396  Aye    This is an SBIR Phase II awards that builds on the proof-of- 
              concept of a real time 3-D display, based on a stationary  holographic diffuser
              screen using volume-multiplexed holographic  optical elements and a simple,
              conventional projection system.   The diffused holographic screen focuses the
              stereoscopic 3-D  pattern from two projectors into an observer's eyes without
              the  necessity of polarizing glasses and focusing lenses.  The viewing  area
              resembles an ordinary TV projection screen creating the  impression of a
              natural 3-D image with this approach.  For  example, a robot photographing
              images with two cameras - placed  in the locations corresponding to each robot
              "eye" - and having  them transmitted for viewing by human observers, would
              yield 3-D  replicas of the scene form the human perspective corresponding to 
              the (left, right) eyes of the viewing of different distinct  volumes with
              resulting impression of stereoscopic depth.      ***
