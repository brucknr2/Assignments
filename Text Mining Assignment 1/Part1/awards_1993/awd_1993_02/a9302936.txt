Abstract    :
              9302936  Fine  In this field study, the PI's will participate with Indonesian 
              scientists in a study of the flow of water from the Pacific to the  Indian
              Ocean through the Indonesian archipelago.  In this  particular component, the
              PI will carry out tracer measurements  designed to identify water mass ages and
              paths, and to provide  constraints on the hydrography, biological property, and
              nutrient  measurements, supported under other grants.  The Indonesians will 
              supply the research vessel.  Joint work by Australian and other  neighboring
              countries will provide current meters and sea level  measurements.
