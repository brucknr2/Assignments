Abstract    :
              9302381  Schwarz    Experiments are to be conducted which characterize the 
              boundary layer with air flow over a flat surface coated with a  flexible,
              complaint material.  The effect of surface  compliance on linear stability of
              the boundary layer,  transition to turbulence, and drag reduction for turbulent
               flow will be systematically explored.  Preliminary experiments  have been
              completed to demonstrate that increase of stability  is possible with a
              compliant surface in air flow.    Drag and turbulence transition reduction from
              a compliant  surface is known to exist for flow of a liqud, with important 
              hydronautic and liquid pumping application.  For air or a gas,  similar energy
              saving possibilities are implied by this  research.  ***
