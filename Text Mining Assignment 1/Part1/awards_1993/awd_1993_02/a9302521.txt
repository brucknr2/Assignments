Abstract    :
              The current award will support travel to an International                      
              Conference on the Commission on Plant Gene Nomenclature.  The                  
              conference will involve scientists from around the world and will              
              be held in Bellagio, Italy, May 3 - 7.  At this conference the                 
              commission  expects to complete recommendations for a system of                
              plant-wide designations of sequence plant genes.  At the                       
              conference, the commission will also discuss plans for                         
              establishing a Plant Gene Registry to serve as a clearing-house                
              for the naming of newly sequenced genes, and for developing a                  
              database of sequenced plant genes, including cross-references and              
              eventually electronic links to sequence libraries and to                       
              databases of Arabidopsis, maize, of other plants as those are                  
              develope, and to genetic databases of other organisms.
