Abstract    :
              Lin  9302915    The PIs will analyze geophysical data and perform modelling on 
              Galapagos Hot Spot data to understand how hot spots interact with  a spreading
              center.  This is an extension of the current work on  modelling bathymetry and
              gravity in the Galapagos.  A 3-D modelling  experiment will be performed to
              explore the influences of viscosity  variations, pressure gradients and
              buoyance forces on plume  entrainment and dispersion, temperature structure and
              melt  production.  The model will be used to calculate excess crustal 
              thickness, depth anomalies, gravity anomalies and variations in the  elastic
              plate thickness.  The overall goal is to better understand  mantle dynamics of
              ridge-lume interactions.
