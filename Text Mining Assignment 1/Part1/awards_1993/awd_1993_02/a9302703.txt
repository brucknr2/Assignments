Abstract    :
                   The research entails methods of non-commutative differential              
              geometry to study the topological and analytic invariants of                   
              partially elliptic pseduodifferential operators.  In this way                  
              local analytic formulas can be obtained for topological                        
              characteristic classes.  Also intended is a study of the higher-               
              eta invariants relative to index theorems on manifolds with                    
              boundary.
