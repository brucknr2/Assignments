Abstract    :
              This research project deals with an analytical and experimental                
              study of friction in machine tools. The experimental aspects                   
              include the design and fabrication of a double-shear friction                  
              apparatus for active control of both sliding velocity and normal               
              force, and the collection of data at the friction interface for a              
              variety of materials and lubricants. The analytical component of               
              the research project utilizes the test data for developing history-            
              dependent friction models. There models are used to study the                  
              design and analysis of controllers for high-fidelity motion,                   
              including the development of stability  criteria, and design of                
              model-based and adaptive compensators. These models are applied to             
              the design and performance evaluation of passive and active                    
              friction dampers and structural joints. Analytical techniques such             
              as perturbation theory and nonlinear dynamical system theory are               
              used. The results of this research lead to a better understanding              
              of low-velocity motion control such as required for high-precision             
              machines in manufacturing, and improvements in the performance of              
              friction dampers used in turbo  machinery and damping joints used              
              in flexible structures.***    //
