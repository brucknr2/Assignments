Abstract    :
              The purpose of this Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists               
              and Engineers is to perform a preliminary investigation of the                 
              possibility of developing a procedure for materials                            
              characterization using ultrasonic attenuation methods.  In                     
              particular, this method will be explored to determine if it will               
              be practical for the examination of the grain of materials.
