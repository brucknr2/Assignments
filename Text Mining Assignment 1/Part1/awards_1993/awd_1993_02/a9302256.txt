Abstract    :
                   The production of efficient and adequate temporal                         
              reasoning methods for concurrent systems is a long range goal                  
              of this project.  A branching time model with intervals as the                 
              underlying unit of time will be used to represent constructs                   
              from concurrent programming.  In particular, the following                     
              tasks shall be undertaken:                                                     
                                                                                             
                        O  Establish the correctness of twenty-four atomic                   
                           relations between intervals in branching time and                 
                           the table of their compositions.                                  
                                                                                             
                        O  Create a formal interpretation of executions of                   
                           concurrent programs in terms of the model.                        
                                                                                             
                        O  Determine the expression in the model of the                      
                           important concurrency relationships such as                       
                           mutual exclusion, deadlock freedom, and                           
                           fairness.
