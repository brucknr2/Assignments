Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research involves participation in the 1993 Intergovernmental              
              Oceanographic Commission Open-Ocean Baseline Survey for Trace                  
              Metals: Atlantic Ocean expedition, scheduled aboard the Canadian               
              ship CSS Hudson between July and August, 1993. The IOC Open-Ocean              
              Baseline program is organized t evaluate the current concentrations            
              of a variety of trace metals and other anthropogenic pollutants in             
              the major water masses of the world oceans.  This will stand as a              
              "baseline" against which future anthropogenic impacts can be                   
              compared.  The proposed cruise track and station locations will                
              allow sampling of deep, source water masses to the North Atlantic              
              in the overflow and formation regions.  In between deep profiling              
              stations, near-surface samples will be collected in transects                  
              (every 3-4 hours) using a clean, towed "fish"/pumping system.                  
                                                                                             
              Samples will be collected by the PI under "contamination-free"                 
              conditions for a number of U.S. and international participating                
              laboratories.  Samples from the deep profiling stations will be                
              filtered under clean-lab conditions for particulate (>0.4 um) and              
              total dissolved (<0.4 um) trace elements. Samples from the surface             
              transect will be processed for particulate (>0.4 um), total                    
              dissolved (0.4 um), colloidal (3,000 MW to 0.4 um), and truly                  
              dissolved (<3,000 MW) metals and analyzed by the PI for Cr(VI), Mn,            
              Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb. Samples for dissolved DOC and DON              
              fractions (as described for metals above) will also be collected               
              along with the colloidal trace metal samples and analyzed by the               
              high temperature catalytic oxidation technique to address the                  
              unresolved questions regarding the importance of high MW DOC/DON in            
              seawater.
