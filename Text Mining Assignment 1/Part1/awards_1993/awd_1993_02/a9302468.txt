Abstract    :
                9302468  Field    This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              Program   will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of  
              Montana in the purchase of a 300 MHz, multinuclear, nuclear   magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This new instrumentation   will enhance greatly
              research in a number of  areas including   the following:    1)  Solution
              dynamics of main group-transition metal clusters,  2)  Anomalously large
              kinetic deuterium isotope effects in   transition metal cluster hydrides,  3) 
              The chemistry of low oxidation state metal clusters in   water,  4)  Chemical
              mechanisms in  thermal polymerization of glycosides   and in pyrolysis of
              polysaccharides,  5)  Hydrogen/deuterium kinetic isotope effects using
              unlabeled   (natural abundance) reagents,  6)  Solution chemistry of triplet
              cyclohepta-trienylidene and   triplet cyclonona-tetraenylidene,  7) Competition
              kinetics in the cycloheptatri-  enylidene/cycloheptatetraene system,  8) 
              Development of methodology for the synthesis of homochiral   compounds 
              containing nitrogen.  %%%       A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer
              is used to   obtain information about molecular structure (what types of  
              carbon and/or hydrogen atoms are present, what are the relative   number of
              each type of atoms and how are they connected to one   another in the molecule)
              and molecular dynamics (how rapidly are   the various parts of the molecule
              moving).  This instrument is   essential for any meaningful, modern synthetic
              chemistry   research program.  ***
