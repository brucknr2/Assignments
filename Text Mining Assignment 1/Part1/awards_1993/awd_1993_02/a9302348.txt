Abstract    :
              A9302348  Knut       The aim of this research is to investigate the role of 
              stratospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on the ozone chemistry and  abundance. 
              The researchers will measure NO2 column densities at  two high-latitude sites
              in the northern hemisphere using twilight  absorption spectroscopy in the
              wavelength range 430-450 nm where  NO2 has appreciable absorption features.  
              One of these sites  (Svalbard, Norway, 78 degrees N) is expected to be inside
              the polar  vortex more frequently than the other (Fairbanks, Alaska, 65 
              degrees N).  The measurements will be conducted on a continuous  basis
              providing a baseline for NO2 abundance under perturbed as  well as unperturbed
              stratospheric conditions.  This set of  measurements will allow these
              researchers to study differences in  NO2 climatology between the two sites and
              relate the NO2 abundance  to stratospheric ozone content, temperature, and
              circulation.   Radiative transfer modeling including the effects of spherical 
              geometry and refraction in the presence of cloud and aerosol layers  will be
              used to construct synthetic spectra that will allow them to  study the
              sensitivity of the retrieved NO2 abundance to cloud and  aerosol effects as
              well as the feasibility of retrieving NO2  vertical profiles.
