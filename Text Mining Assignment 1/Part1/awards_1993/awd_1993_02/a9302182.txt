Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program is a companion project to OCE-9302182 (R. Peterson,               
              SIO, PI).  The objective of the joint project is to perform a pilot            
              experiment for the Fast Hydrographic Profiler (FHP).  The FHP is an            
              autonomous, prototypical high-speed vehicle to make full-depth CTD             
              profiles developed by A. Bradley at WHOI.  Because a full-depth CTD            
              cast with the FHP can be done in just 40 minutes, the FHP is a very            
              attractive instrument for further minimize the cost of the field               
              programs.  The aim of the pilot experiment is to run the FHP                   
              through a pair of thorough sea trials, during the ongoing CalCOFI              
              (california Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) program.             
              Funds were granted to prepare the FHP and its support gear, adapt              
              the gear to the ship that does the CalCOFI survey work and joint               
              two separate eight day cruises in the later half of 1993.
