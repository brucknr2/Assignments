Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Bartell will study the dynamics of                  
              homogeneous nucleation in phase changes in which he will use                   
              two new techniques which are relevant to studying solid-state                  
              transformations.  Experimentally he will probe clusters                        
              generated in a supersonic flow using electron diffraction at                   
              various times-of-flight to monitor changes in packing during                   
              molecular "phase transitions."  He will also characterize the                  
              molecular behavior computationally using molecular dynamics                    
              simulations.  The formation of "critical nuclei" will be                       
              revealed by the simulations.  Many of the same phase                           
              transitions will be studied using both techniques.

              Studies of nucleation, such as the changes from one phase to                   
              another in solid- or liquid-state matter, are of crucial                       
              importance in many areas of science and technology, such as                    
              meteorology, materials engineering, petroleum catalysis, and                   
              earth sciences.  This research program aims at acquiring a                     
              better understanding of such homogeneous phase changes by                      
              examining the different ways that molecules are packed in                      
              arrays.  A special emphasis of this program is a comparison of                 
              theoretical prediction and experimental measurement of the rate                
              of phase transitions.  New tests of nucleation theory will be                  
              made, resulting in insights into the molecular mechanisms of                   
              phase changes.
