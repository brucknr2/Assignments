Abstract    :
              9302184  McClain         This is a detailed examination of the Clipperton
              transform  fault, a major transform offset of an intermediate-to-fast 
              spreading mid-ocean ridge. The study will employ ocean bottom  seismometers and
              a dense array of sources, together with gravity  and bathymetric measurements,
              to determine the three-dimensional  structure of the fracture zone and adjacent
              seafloor. The following  questions will be addressed: (1) How does the crustal
              structure  change in proximity to the transform fault? (2) What is the deep 
              structure under the compels bathymetry of the transform plate  boundary itself?
              (3) Do ridge-transform intersection processes  alter the structure of the
              transform plate boundary zone? (4) What  is the nature of the crust being
              generated along the ridges to the   north and south of the transform?
