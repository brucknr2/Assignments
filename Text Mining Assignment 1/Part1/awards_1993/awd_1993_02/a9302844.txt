Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The ALOHA-93 and CADRE campaigns are centered one measurements            
              of middle atmosphere dynamics at low and equatorial latitudes.  As             
              part of the ALOHA-93/CADRE campaign, a detailed investigation will             
              be made of the properties and sources of small scale gravity waves             
              that occur within about 500 km radius of the Hawaiian Islands.  In             
              particular, sequential observations of the OI (557.7 nm), Na (589.2            
              nm) and near infrared OH emissions will be used to provide a                   
              comprehensive data set valuable for the investigation of both                  
              horizontal and vertical gravity wave propagation, horizontal                   
              anisotropy, wind filtering and wave dissipation.  These data will              
              significantly extend the range over which correlative studies can              
              be made with the airborne measurements and will be highly                      
              complementary to the other ground based measurements.  The 2-                  
              dimensional wave information provided by the image data at each                
              emission altitude will be particularly useful in the investigation             
              of the dominant sources of small scale gravity waves over the mid-             
              Pacific ocean.
