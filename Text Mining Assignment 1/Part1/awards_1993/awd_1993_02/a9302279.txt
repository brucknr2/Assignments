Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In the past two decades, researching the functional morphology of              
              primate teeth has managed to make connections with certain diets.              
              Long molar crest length has been associated with leaf and insect               
              diets, cups sharpness with insect diets, and low crown relief                  
              with fruit diets.  However, there has been little attention to                 
              the obvious variation in the physical properties of foods (eg.                 
              hardness of various preferred fruits or nuts, or even in leaf                  
              tenderness).  Also, seasonal variation in diets has not been                   
              addressed systematically in such studies, but clearly that is an               
              important variable.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This study will address these and related issues in field and                  
              museum studies of a series of Madagascar strepsirhines.  It will               
              provide insights into the relation of tooth form and structure to              
              dietary variation.
