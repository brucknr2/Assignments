Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the most amazing feats that the nervous system performs is              
              stabilization of the perceived visual world when the retinal                   
              display is continually shifting because of eye, head and body                  
              movements.  If our neural representation of the world did not                  
              remain steady, we would be subjected to continual nauseating                   
              displacements.  We do not understand how the nervous system                    
              transforms and coordinates all the incoming signals about body                 
              position in order to perform this feat.  Dr. Berkley has                       
              discovered a fascinating phenomenon that offers a new paradigm                 
              for understanding this question which he will explore with this                
              small grant for exploratory research.  Unexpectedly, in the midst              
              of experiments designed to answer another problem, he discovered               
              that paralyzing the muscles that move one eye causes paralysis in              
              the muscles that move the other eye, even though anesthetic used               
              for the immobilization was confined to one eye.  He will                       
              investigate how feedback from the muscles of the paralyzed eye is              
              used to control the actions of the intact eye.  The information                
              obtained in this investigation will be helpful to physicians                   
              treating eye movement disorders as well as to the designers of                 
              robot systems for visually guided reaching.***//
