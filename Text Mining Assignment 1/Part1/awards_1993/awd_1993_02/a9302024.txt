Abstract    :
                   Functional analysis is one of the most important directions               
              in the mathematics of the twentieth century.  Many mathematicians              
              in the United States and other countries are involved in research              
              in this area, and conferences are frequently organized on many                 
              aspects of functional analysis and its applications.  We propose               
              to organize a very special conference, entitled "Functional                    
              Analysis on the Eve of the Twenty-First Century," at Rutgers                   
              University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, from October 24 to October              
              27, 1993.  The aim will be to focus on new directions of the                   
              subject, directions which can be expected to define the                        
              development of much of the subject for many years.                             
              Correspondingly, we plan to invite as speakers leading experts in              
              topics connected with new directions in functional analysis.  We               
              plan to include as an essential part of the participants young                 
              mathematicians who are beginning their research activity, with                 
              the intention of providing some guidance which will be of value                
              throughout their scientific life.  We expect that the lively                   
              discussion of ideas among participants with many different                     
              orientations will prove to be one of most important features of                
              the conference.  A special stimulus for planning this conference               
              is the eightieth birthday of Israel Moiseyevich Gelfand, who has               
              played a crucial role in the development of functional analysis                
              during the last half-century, and who is now at Rutgers                        
              University.
