Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at Bowling Green                       
              University in the purchase of a 400 MHz, multinuclear, nuclear                 
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This new                               
              instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of                   
              areas including the following:                                                 
                                                                                             
              1)  Electron-transfer across artificial B-sheets,                              
              2)  Allosteric regulation of water soluble receptors,                          
              3)  NMR studies of the structures of branched nucleic acids,                   
              4)  Photosensitized energy and electron transfer reactions in                  
              surfactant bilayers on colloidal inorganic supports,                           
              5)  NMR studies of rapidly polymerizing multifunctional monors.                
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to                     
              obtain information about molecular structure (what types of                    
              carbon and/or hydrogen atoms are present, what are the relative                
              number of each type of atoms and how are they connected to one                 
              another in the molecule) and molecular dynamics (how rapidly                   
              are the various parts of the moleule moving.  This instrument                  
              is essential for any meaningful, modern synthetic chemistry                    
              research program.
