              This grant will support the American Academy of Arts and                       
              Sciences' management of the  U.S. Committee for the International              
              Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).  IIASA, which is               
              located in Laxenburg, Austria, is a multinational, non-governmental            
              institution established in 1972 to conduct research in systems                 
              analysis, "in relation to problems of modern society arising from              
              scientific and technological development." A major current area of             
              activity is global change research, which the U.S. Committee                   
              monitors and evaluates.   Funds from the grant will support: (1) the           
              office of the Executive Director of the Committee at the American              
              Academy; (2) domestic travel for Committee members to                          
              participate in bi-annual meetings; (3) travel to IIASA for qualified           
              U.S. scientists as a means for addressing the Committee's objective            
              of intensifying involvement of the U.S. scientific community in                
              IIASA's work; and (4) participation of outstanding advanced U.S.               
              graduate students in IIASA's Young Scientist Program.
