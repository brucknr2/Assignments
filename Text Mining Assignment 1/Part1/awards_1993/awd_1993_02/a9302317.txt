Abstract    :
                   Global properties of the space of harmonic maps from certain              
              compact Riemann surfaces to compact Lie groups will be                         
              investigated. The method uses loop groups as symmetry groups of                
              the harmonic map equation, to reduce the problem to consideration              
              of an associated space of holomorphic maps. The topology of                    
              spaces of holomorphic maps from the 2-sphere to various complex                
              manifolds will be studied by using ideas from configuration space              
              theory, and the space of harmonic maps from a 2-torus to a                     
              compact Lie group will be studied by using methods of the theory               
              of integrable systems.
