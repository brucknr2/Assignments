Abstract    :
                    9302270  Grummon  This project is a theoretical and experimental study of 
              thermoelastically active thin film structures.  The theoretical  effect focuses
              on predictive strategies capturing deformation-  and stress-states in variant
              distributions generated by the  experimental protocols involving
              nickel-titanium thin films  fabricated to contain semicoherent precipitates. 
              Interfacial  strain-fields associated with the precipitates will enable 
              cyclically reversible shape-strains, available to do useful
