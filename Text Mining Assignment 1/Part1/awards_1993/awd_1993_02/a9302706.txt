Abstract    :
                   Several different frameworks for the mathematical theory of               
              linear control systems have been developed over the last three                 
              decades. This project combines two important and well-developed                
              approaches: the function-theoretic methodology and the techniques              
              of commutative algebra and module theory. The specific technical               
              research issues which will be adressed include the geometric                   
              study of poles and transmission zeros of singular systems;                     
              construction and application of a local algebraic version of the               
              fundamental pole-zero exact sequence of a singular linear system;              
              characterization and construction of globally minimal generalized              
              inverses of linear systems; algebraic and analytic studies of                  
              Wiener-Hopf factorization; studies of singular values and                      
              spectral factorization; and interpolation of matrix functions.                 
                   The theory of feedback control systems, originally motivated              
              by problems in engineering, occupies a central place in applied                
              mathematics and is fundamental to control engineering                          
              applications. The present project examines mathematical questions              
              for the generalized or "singular" linear systems which arise                   
              naturally when complicated networks are constructed from smaller               
              components. The poles of these systems govern stability and long-              
              term behavior, while the transmission zeros govern adaptability                
              and transient responses. Techniques both from functional analysis              
              and the modern theory of abstract algebraic structures will be                 
              combined in these studies to provide the conceptual foundations                
              and new technical results for these systems.
