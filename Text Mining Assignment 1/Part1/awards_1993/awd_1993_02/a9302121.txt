Abstract    :
              9302121  Yee         This project is intended to place the investigator's
              airglow  spectrograph aboard the NCAR Electra.  This will provide  correlative
              airglow data on the mesospheric airglow intensities and  temperatures along
              with Na density measurements, obtain their 1-D  spatial and temporal spectra,
              and study the gravity wave dynamics  and its possible sources.  Simultaneously,
              measurements can be made  on the airglow intensity and temperature with the
              sodium density to  understand the formation of sporadic Na layer.  It will also
              be  possible to measure temperatures in the high latitude mesopause  region in
              order to understand the formation of noctilucent clouds.   Finally, this will
              be an attempt to study the geographic extent of  the NLC display and its
              spectral characteristics.  ***
