Abstract    :
              9302187  Lee  In this project, PIs will deploy a current meter array, east of 
              Taiwan, near 24 degrees north in the western Pacific as part of the  World
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  These instruments will  measure the
              structure and variability of volume and heat transports  of the Kuroshio for a
              two-year period from summer, 1994 through the  array, providing additional
              current meter moorings, Inverted Echo  Sounders, tide gauges, and repeated
              sections, using shipboard  Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD) and Acoustic
              Doppler Current  Profilers (ADCP), to examine spatial variability at several 
              different times during the period.  ***
