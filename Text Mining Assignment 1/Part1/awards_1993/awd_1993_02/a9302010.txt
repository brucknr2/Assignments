Abstract    :
                   Hadwin will continue his work on approximate similarity and               
              on closures of direct sums of classes of operators.  He will also              
              study invariant operator ranges in a von Neumann algebra, and                  
              investigate a new version of K-theory based on operator ranges.                
              In addition, Hadwin will study operator algebras from a purely                 
              algebraic point of view.  This is expected to contribute to both               
              operator theory and abstract algebra.                                          
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
