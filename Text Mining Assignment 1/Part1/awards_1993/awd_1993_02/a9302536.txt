Abstract    :
                   In an effort to increase the number of women entering graduate            
              school in CISE disciplines, the Computing Research Association                 
              (CRA) is proposing a distributed mentoring project where 20-                   
              30 female undergraduate students will be matched with a number of              
              female professors in CISE research areas each year, to participate             
              in summer of research at the mentor's institution. The students                
              will most likely be computer science or computer engineering majors            
              although this is not required.                                                 
                                                                                             
                   The CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian academic                   
              departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering and                   
              Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research. The              
              mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research               
              community and to support and promote its interests. Dr. Weingarten             
              is the Executive Director of CRA. Dr. O'Rourke, the academic leader            
              of this project, is the Department Chair of Computer Science at                
              Smith College, Massachusetts.
