Abstract    :
              Dr. Marin S. Robinson has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                 
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Robinson's doctoral degree was                    
              from the University of Colorado/Boulder under the supervision                  
              of Professor Charles DePuy. Dr. Robinson will continue research                
              at the University of Colorado/Boulder under the sponsorship of                 
              Professor Margaret Tolbert. Dr. Robinson's postdoctoral                        
              position will provide her the opportunity to construct a flow                  
              tube apparatus and study heterogeneous processes between gas                   
              phase molecules and metal surfaces. Longer term, she plans to                  
              apply her postdoctoral experience to the study of chemical                     
              reactivity of ion-molecules and ion-radicals on model ice                      
              surfaces and metal surfaces. These studies will advance our                    
              fundamental understanding of both atmospheric chemistry and                    
              catalysis by metals.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
