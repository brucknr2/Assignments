Abstract    :
              9302370  Anderson       Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas and, as the 
              original Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX) proposal  pints out,
              water vapor is therefore the dominant regulator of the  Earth's energy budget
              and thus the critical regulator of climate.   An understanding of the processes
              that dictate the distribution of  water vapor and the processes that link the
              distribution of water  in all its phases to the frequency-dependent divergence
              of flux and  radiance constitutes a central element in any considered strategy 
              to understand secular trends of the Earth's climate.       The PIs will augment
              the array of CEPEX observations with in  situ observations of water vapor,
              ozone, pressure and temperature  from the ER-2 aircraft.       Water vapor
              measurements will be carried out using the Lyman-  alpha photofragmentionion
              technique:            Water vapor + hv   hydroxyl(A) + hydrogen             
              hydroxyl radical(X) + hv + hydrogen  that fragments a water vapor molecule with
              121.6 nm radiation from  a plasma discharge lamp and observes 308 nm radiation
              from the  electronically excited product hydroxyl radical.  This experiment  is
              done both in absorption and in fluorescence to provide a dynamic  range of five
              orders of magnitude in water vapor concentration and  an absolute calibration
              of the instrument during each flight.       Ozone observations will be done
              using ultraviolet absorption  in the Hartley continuum at 257nm.  The
              instrument uses an on-board  Hg resonance lamp; a MnO2 getter to establish the
              absorption cell  count rate in the absence of ozone in the sample; a Roots
              blower to  actively aspirate the measurement cell; and counting electronics to 
              obtain fractional absorption levels of one part in 105.         This research
              is important because it will provide water vapor  and ozone observations needed
              to help interpret climate processes  in a climate-sensitive part of the world.
