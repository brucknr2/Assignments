Abstract    :
              9302906  Chapin       We propose a workshop (1) to synthesize current
              information  and hypotheses about the patterns and causes of diversity in 
              arctic and alpine tundra, (2) to develop predictions about the  impact of
              global change on future biodiversity of tundra, (3) to  develop a framework for
              understanding the ecosystem consequences  of tundra biodiversity, and (4) to
              discuss experimental  approaches for testing these hypotheses and approaches. 
              ***  Such a workshop is important to address the functional  consequences of
              biodiversity in a rapidly changing world.  It is  particularly appropriate to
              address these questions in tundra,  where low biodiversity may make the system
              vulnerable to any  changes in biodiversity which occur, where the communities
              are  simple and small enough to manipulate diversity and observe the  ecosystem
              consequences, and where manipulations simulating  climate change have caused a
              substantial decline in species  richness in less than a decade.  %%%
