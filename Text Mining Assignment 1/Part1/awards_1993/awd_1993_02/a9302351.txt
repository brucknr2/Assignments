Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Wyoming in the purchase of a Gas Chromatograph Mass                            
              Spectrometer (GC-MS).  This new instrumentation will enhance                   
              greatly research in a number of areas including the following:                 
                                                                                             
              1)  Sterochemical dependence of vesicle bilayer properties,                    
              2)  Biomimetic oxidation of guanidines by metalloporphyrin oxo                 
              and nitrosyl complexes:  Toward a rational understanding of the                
              biosynthesis of nitric oxide from arginine,                                    
              3)  Photochemical oxidation of organic sulfides,                               
              4)  Reactive geometries of carbonyl-Lewis acid complexes,                      
              5)  Mechanistic and preparative studies of the electrocatalytic                
              reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons using polymer/metal electrodes.               
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC/MS) is used to                     
              separate the molecules in a reaction mixture, to measure the                   
              relative amounts of the various molecules present and to obtain                
              information about the molecular weight of the molecules                        
              present.  This instrument is essential for research work in                    
              modern chemical synthesis.
