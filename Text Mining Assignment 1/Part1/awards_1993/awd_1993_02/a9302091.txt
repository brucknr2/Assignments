Abstract    :
              9302091 Cochran           This is a geophysical study of the Southeast Indian
              Ridge near to investigate the change in the morphology and structure of mid
              ocean ridges that occur at intermediate (60 80 mm/year) spreading rates. A
              field program will collect multibeam bathymetry, side scan sonar, gravity, and
              magnetic data between 95 and 108 degrees east on the crest and flanks of the
              ridge where there is a change from an axial valley morphology. The data will be
              used to determine how the transition in axial morphology occurs and its effects
              on ridge axis segmentation, the structure of the axial accretion zone, ridge
              axis isostasy, mantle upwelling and magma distribution along the axis, the
              abyssal hill fabric and the tectonic processes that form abyssal hills. ***
