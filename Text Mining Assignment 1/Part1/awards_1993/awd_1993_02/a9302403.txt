Abstract    :
              9302403  Brown  A low cost GPS Time sensor is  proposed to be developed which
              will  be suitable for power system fault  detection and control.  GPS  provides
              a highly precise time  reference which allows data to be  synchronized to
              within 100  nanoseconds between substations and  control centers.  Applications
              of  precise time in power control  include data logging, relay  testing, fault
              isolation and phase  angle measurements.  Failures can  be isolated in a grid
              to a  precision of 100 meters by  measuring the relative time of  arrival of a
              fault at two stations.   Phase angle measurements can be  determined to a
              precision of 40  micro-rad.  Currently, the least  expensive GPS timing
              receivers  suitable for power system control  cost over $10,000.  Such
              equipment  would be very expensive to install  at tens of thousands of
              substations  throughout the electric power  grids.  It is proposed under this 
              effort to develop a low cost  precise time synchronization GPS  sensor for use
              in electrical power  system monitoring.  The proposed  sensor will provide a
              highly  reliable, time reference accurate  to 100 nanoseconds for a cost of 
              less than $1,500.  ***
