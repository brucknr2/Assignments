Abstract    :
              This proposal is for a grant to support research in                            
              Systems and Control Theory for Power Systems,                                  
              part of the Institute for Mathematics and its                                  
              Applications (IMA) program for 1992-1993.                                      
              Specifically the grant would provide partial support                           
              for 8 participants in the workshop Systems and                                 
              Control Theory for Power Systems.  The                                         
              prospective participants are among the most                                    
              outstanding and productive researchers in the field                            
              of the application of mathematical theory to power                             
              system problems.  Additional support is expected                               
              from the Electric Power Research Institute .  The                              
              workshop proceedings will be published in the                                  
              series, IMA Volumes in Mathematics and its                                     
              Applications.
