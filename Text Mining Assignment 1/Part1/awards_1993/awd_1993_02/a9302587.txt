Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The University  of Hawaii will operate the R/V MOANA WAVE in              
              1993 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded                
              research projects.  The MOANA WAVE is a 210' general research                  
              vessel owned by the U.S. Navy and operated as a UNOLS vessel in                
              support of academic research. In early 1993 MOANA WAVE will support            
              the global change project TOGA-CORE. In late April the vessel will             
              support a 40 day ODP cruise, which will map an area of the seafloor            
              where undersea rift system are converging with continental crust               
              off the southeast tip of New Guinea (Woodlark Basin).  The vessel              
              will then support Navy cruises between Guam and Japan. Following               
              the cruise off Japan the MOANA WAVE will enter an extensive                    
              shipyard period.  On returning to service the vessel will support              
              a physical oceanography cruise that will take the vessel back to               
              Honolulu. For the remainder of the Year, MOANA WAVE will support               
              short cruise out of Hawaii including the Hawaii Time Series                    
              project.                                                                       
                                                                                             
                   The MOANA WAVE is part of the academic fleet used by NSF to               
              support oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research                   
              requires highly specialized equipment that must be permanently                 
              installed on a ship for which the ship must be specifically                    
              designed. This equipment also requires highly trained crew members             
              for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the             
              same manner as  general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF               
              supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically                    
              dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by                       
              universities and research institutions around the country.
