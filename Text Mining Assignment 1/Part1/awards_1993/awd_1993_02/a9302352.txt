Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports collaboration by Dr. Gilbert               
              Hanson of State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook with              
              Dr. V. Rajamani of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi              
              on geochemical study of the Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC) in South              
              India.  The study is aimed at a hypothesis that the EDC is made                
              up of accretionary terranes and that gold mineralization occurred              
              associated with accretion of the terranes.  If there are                       
              different terranes, it is intended to determine the histories of               
              the rocks within the various terranes and determine the timing of              
              their assemblage.  The field work will continue geological                     
              studies in the Ramagiri Schist Belt, and begin studies of the                  
              Hutti-Maski Schist Belt 500 Km north of the Kolar Schist Belt                  
              along regional structural trend.  The work will include                        
              collecting samples by the U.S. and Indian scientists in the                    
              field, to be followed by chemical analysis mainly at the SUNY                  
              laboratory by the U.S. and Indian co-investigators.  Some of the               
              chemical analysis will be done at JNU by Dr. Rajamani and his                  
              students.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project is building on a well-established working                 
              relationship by the two scientists.  They have several joint                   
              publications as a result of their previous work.  This project is              
              likely to continue this productive scientific cooperation.  U.S.               
              Graduate students and post doctorates, from the SUNY at Stony                  
              Brook, are involved in the field work, and are expected to gain                
              experience in international research efforts.
