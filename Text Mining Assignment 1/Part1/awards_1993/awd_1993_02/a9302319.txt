Abstract    :
              9302319  Nations       This proposal is to support a research project for Native
               American students (Hopi and Navajo people) at various career levels  in
              evaluating the coal resources and determiningg the potential for  coalbed
              methane gas production from Cretaceous rocks on their  reservations.  The
              project would serve as a vehicle for science  education that is relevant to
              current scientific, economic, and  cultural problems on the Navajo and Hopi
              reservations.  Coupled  with the collaborative educational outreach phase of
              the program,  this research project should stimulate greater interest in
              science  among Native American students at all educational levels.  Thus the 
              project would direct Native American students toward careers in the  sciences
              and teaching while answering cogent scientific and  economic questions.
