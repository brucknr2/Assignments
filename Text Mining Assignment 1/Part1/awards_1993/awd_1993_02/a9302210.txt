Abstract    :
              An experimental study will be made to determine the effects of                 
              contact vibrations on friction and wear in dry sliding contact                 
              and to develop maps of optimal amplitude and frequency conditions              
              to give minimal wear and/or friction for given conditions.                     
              Vibrations will be imposed from external actuators or generated                
              by the sliding surfaces due to engineered surface roughness.  The              
              results will be used to develop and validate a model for the                   
              effect and to form the basis for design selection of operating                 
              conditions for components such as electrical brushes.
