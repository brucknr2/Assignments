Abstract    :
              An unresolved controversy in paleoceanography is the role of warm,              
                                                                                            
              saline bottom water (WSBW), presumably formed at low latitudes in              
                                                                                             
              restricted marginal basins, now occurring in deep water                        
              circulation.  Stable oxygen and carbon isotope data suggest WSBW               
                                                                                             
              may have dominated ocean circulation at several times in the past,             
                                                                                             
              but stale isotope signatures are not unique water mass tracers.                
                                                                                             
              Due to the short oceanic residence time of Nd and the distinct Nd              
                                                                                             
              isotope input values to different water masses, this Nd isotopic               
                                                                                             
              system may be a conservative tracer of water mass.  Fish tooth                 
              apatite may provide a deep water record through Nd isotopes.  This             
                                                                                             
              study  should aid in evaluating the timing and mechanism of the                
              rare earth element (REE) uptake in fish tooth apatite by examining             
                                                                                             
              samples from two deep sea sites with different lithologic controls             
                                                                                             
              on diagenetic alteration.  It should also allow us to determine                
              fish tooth composition across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, a time            
                                                                                             
              of proposed WSBS formation.  Major changes in the mode of ocean                
              circulation in the past would impact nutrient distributions and                
              redox conditions, as well as the transfer of heat and air/sea                  
              exchange of atmospheric gases that directly influence global                   
              climate.
