Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Joseph B. Lambert at Northwestern                 
              University, who will study stereoelectronic aspects of reactive                
              intermediates. One focal point is to determine how electronic                  
              effects are propagated through sigma bonds. Targets are to evaluate            
              the zeta effect of stannylenium ions, the mechanism of the beta-               
              silicon effect, and a search for the beta-phosphonate effect in                
              carbocation formation. The second focal point is to obtain new                 
              formulations of solvents and anions to produce free silyl, germyl,             
              and stannyl cations. The third topic concerns conformations of                 
              flexible molecules in the solid state, which is footed on five-                
              membered rings and the use of a cultivated solid state NMR                     
              spectroscopic technique.                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The results from Professor Joseph B. Lambert's studies on reactive             
              intermediates will contribute to our understanding on how                      
              electronic effects are propagated through bonds. His research is               
              focussed largely on silyl and stannyl cations. Their isolation is              
              also sought to verify their existence as intermediates. These                  
              mechanistic studies have the potential to translate in a broad                 
              spectrum of synthetic applications. Novel conformational studies on            
              cyclopentanes will be conducted that will provide information that             
              is relevant in the area of molecular dynamics.//
