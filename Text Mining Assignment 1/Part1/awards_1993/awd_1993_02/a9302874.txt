Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 4-week Summer School Workshop, the third in a series devoted              
              to  comparisons of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems,              
              focuses  on  structured  population  models.   Structured  models              
              explicitly  link  the biology of individual to  the  dynamics  of              
              populations.   The course will cover all three main  mathematical              
              approaches  to  structured  models:  matrix  population   models,              
              partial  differential  equation models,  and  delay  differential              
              equation models.  Structured models have a crucial role  to  play              
              in two important problems that cut across marine, terrestrial and              
              freshwater  ecosystems.  One is the response  of  populations  to              
              global  climate  change, and the other is the difference  between              
              marine  populations and terrestrial populations.  This course  is              
              designed  to  examine  in  which  way  individual  responses   in              
              different environments are translated into population dynamics.
