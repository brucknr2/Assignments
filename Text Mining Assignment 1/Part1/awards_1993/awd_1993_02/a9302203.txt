Abstract    :
              9302203  Liu    Research is to be carried out on breaking surface waves. The 
              approach is largely experimental, with some modeling of the  breaking process
              also included. Both periodic waves  and wave  groups with a modulated amplitude
              will be investigated in a wave  tank at constant depth. Breaking wave groups on
              a sloping bottom  simulating beaches will also be investigated. Experimental
              tools  will be both two dimensional LDV, as well as Particle Imaging 
              Velocimetry.    Wave breaking and associated sediment transport are of great 
              importance in coastal stability and storm erosion, and  mitigation strategies
              are hampered by incomplete knowledge of  the breaking the process.  ***
