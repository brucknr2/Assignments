                  The "Workshop on Algorithms for Constrained Approximation                 
              and Optimization" will bring together leading researchers in                   
              numerical analysis and approximation theory to discuss new and                 
              innovative approaches to solving difficult problems in the area                
              of constrained approximation and optimization.  The participants,              
              who will come from a academia, private and government research                 
              institutes, and industry, are mostly experts in either                         
              constrained approximation or constrained optimization.  While                  
              there is a nonempty intersection in the problems and techniques                
              familiar to these two groups, there has not been much interaction              
              and cross-fertilization between them.  The purpose of the                      
              proposed workshop is to provide a pleasant and productive setting              
              for participants to engage in an interchange of ideas, to foster               
              collaborative research among the participants, and to expose                   
              young researchers and graduate students to the exciting                        
              mathematics being done at the forefront of these fields.
