Abstract    :
              9302846  Rubin       This award provides funding for 25% of the cost of a high- 
              abundance-sensitivity thermal ionization mass spectrometer to be  operated and
              maintained in the School of Ocean and Earth Science  and Technology at the
              University of Hawaii. Remaining funds  required for this acquisition are
              committed by the University of  Hawaii.       The new mass spectrometer is
              capable of measuring precisely  the relative abundance of isotopes of thorium
              and the uranium decay  series and will be used by University researchers in
              research on  the geochronology of mid-ocean ridge basalt volcanism, mantle 
              geochemistry, and the chronology of global sealevel changes via the  dating of
              island coral platforms.  ***
