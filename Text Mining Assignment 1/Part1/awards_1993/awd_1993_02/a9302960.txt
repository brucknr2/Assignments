Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided for a joint US, Canada, Russia cruise to the Sea            
              of Okhotsk.  The largely inland Sea is believed to be an important             
              source of North Pacific Intermediate Water.  Suitable suite cores              
              and water profile samples will be collected to test the hypothesis             
              of ocean circulation and climate change beyond the last glacial                
              maximum.  The cruise will be undertaken on the Russian vessel R?V              
              Lavrentiev with contributions from US and Canadian PI's.
