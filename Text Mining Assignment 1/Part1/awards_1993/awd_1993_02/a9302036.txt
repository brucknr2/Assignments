Abstract    :
              9302036  Valsiner  This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support the collaboration
              of  Jaan Valsiner of the Carolina Consortium on Human Development at  the
              University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Maria  Ferreira of the
              Brazilian Consortium on Human Development at the  University of Sao Paulo at
              Ribeirao Preto.  The project aims to  explore social ecology of child
              development.    The Carolina Consortium involves the University of North 
              Carolina, North Carolina State University, and Duke University.   The Brazilian
              Consortium involves the University of Brasilia,  University of Sao Paulo at
              Ribeirao Preto, State University of  Campinas, Federal University of
              Pernambuco, and Federal  University of Fluminense.  Research topics in this
              group-to-group  interaction include the construction of semiotic means in 
              adult-infant interaction; cooperation and competition in  children's peer-group
              relations; co-constructivist analysis of  parental and teachers' roles in
              educational settings; life-course  analysis; and children's development of
              literacy in sociocultural  contexts.  All of the institutions involved in this
              collaborative  effort will benefit from an exchange of knowledge and 
              methodologies and the establishment of an organized framework  among Brazilian
              and U.S. developmental scientists.  ***
