Abstract    :
                   This award is for partial support of an International                     
              Conference on Elastic and Diffractive Scattering (the fifth                    
              Blois Workshop) to be held at Brown University in June of this                 
              year.  About 150 scientists from around the world are expected                 
              to attend.  The subject matter is concentrated on hadron                       
              elastic and diffractive scattering phenomena at high energy.                   
              Support is requested in particular to cover travel and                         
              subsistence expenses of invited scientists from eastern Europe                 
              and former member states of the Soviet Union as well as                        
              younger participants.
