Abstract    :
                9302748  Caruthers  The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the 
              Cooperative Institute for Research  in the Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at
              the University of  Colorado are requesting funds from  the National Science
              Foundation to purchase a sequential  stopped-flow spectrophotometer with  both
              fluorescence and UV/vis detection. This instrument will  play an important role
              in the  education of graduate and post-doctoral students and in the  research
              of faculty members in areas as diverse as organic  chemistry, analytical
              chemistry and biochemistry.
