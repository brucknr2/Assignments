Abstract    :
              9302137  Kushner  The project deals with several basic areas in stochastic
              control  with emphasis on numerical methods.  The PI has recently  published a
              book on the subject, and the techniques allow the  effective treatment of many
              of the standard types of problems.   The techniques are applicable to
              deterministic problems and  examples (and proofs and data) are given for hard
              problems  arising in the calculus of variations.  The aim is to encourage  the
              wider use of stochastic systems methods via the numerical  possibilities.  The
              proposal also concerns a variety of  approximation and limit problems in
              complex control systems.  For  example, the control of admission and routing in
              networks in  communications, when there are several classes of customers and 
              the work is in the heavy traffic regime.  There are significant  mathematical
              problems here.  The associated numerical problem is  also of interest.    ***
