Abstract    :
                   Casian will study the problem of computing the cohomology of              
              the flag variety for real reductive Lie groups, the cup product                
              and Weyl group action, using the representation theory of the                  
              group.  He will investigate the problem of determining which                   
              Schubert cells contribute to the non torsion part in homology.                 
              He will also investigate similar problems in the Kac-Moody                     
              setting.                                                                       
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
