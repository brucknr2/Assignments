Abstract    :
              Xu  9302721       This project concerns applications of the theory of special 
              functions to problems of quadrature.  Quadrature is a term given  to methods of
              integration, especially numerical.  It has been  highly developed in one
              dimension with tools such as the Gaussian  quadrature formula.  The present
              work seeks to carry out  numerical integration through methods of cubature in
              several  dimensions.  The generalization is far from straightforward.  The 
              quadratures and cubatures require knowledge of orthogonal  polynomials,
              particularly with common roots.  In  the multidimensional case, orthogonal
              polynomials with common  roots were thought to be rare.  However recent work
              now  establishes that there are many Gaussian cubatures.  The purpose  of this
              work is to use the newly developed tools to investigate  this topic further. 
              Several goals are established.  First, to  obtain applicable characterization
              of Gaussian cubatures, then  to construct new efficient numerical integration
              formulae.   Work will also be done applying the cubature formulae to the 
              theory of interpolation in several variables.       The use of orthogonal
              polynomials in numerical  integration provides formulas which are optimal in
              the sense of  being exact for polynomials of the highest possible degree.  As 
              such they provide good approximations to integrals of smooth  functions.  The
              recent breakthroughs in carrying these ideas over  to several variables holds
              out the possibility of a robust  multivariate cubature and approximation theory
              in several  variables, a subject still in its infancy.   ***
