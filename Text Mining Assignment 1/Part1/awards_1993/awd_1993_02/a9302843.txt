Abstract    :
                   The research entails developing methods of geometric measure              
              theory and calibrated geometries to the study of area minimizing               
              surfaces.  Other components of the project involving the CO-PI's               
              concern problems in topology and number theory.  The proposal is               
              an RUI proposal and as such contains a component dealing with                  
              aspects of undergraduate education for which the talents of the                
              investigators provide an injection of initiatives.
