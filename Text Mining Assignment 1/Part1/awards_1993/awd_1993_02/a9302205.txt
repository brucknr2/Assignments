Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project continues its genetic studies of deep-sea                         
              organismsfrom hydrothermal vent and cold-water                                 
              sulfide/methane seeps.  The objectives of the study are: 1)                    
              to obtain estimates of gene flow among populations living in                   
              hydrothermal vent fields along ridge crests throughout the                     
              world's oceans; and 2) to define phylogenetic relationships                    
              among hot-vent species and similar fauna living in cold-vent                   
              sulfide/methane seeps.  During the past 30 months, frozen                      
              samples of more than 100 species have been collected during                    
              submersible dives to over 25 distinct vent and seep areas                      
              throughout the world.  Additional dives are plan at sites                      
              from which adequate samples are not available.  Genetic data                   
              are obtained from examination of allozymes, mitochrondrial                     
              (mt) DNA, anonymous single-copy nuclear (scn) DNA, and                         
              direct sequencing of PCR amplified genes.  This integrated                     
              genetic approach has already revealed much higher species                      
              diversity in these deep-sea habitats than was previously                       
              known.  Whether the vent organisms of a family constitute a                    
              monophyletic group, whether they had polyphyletic origins                      
              from related seep fauna, or vice versa remains to be                           
              discovered.  Ongoing genetic studies are providing a                           
              comprehensive picture of relationships within and between                      
              the dominant species living in these unusual abyssal                           
              environments.
