Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Savage to work              
              in combinatorics.  One of the fundamental problems in the area of              
              combinatorial algorithms is that of efficiently generating items               
              in a particular class in such a way that each item is generated                
              exactly once.  Asymptotic improvement in the efficiency of                     
              combinatorial generation requires not only good data structures                
              and algorithm design techniques, but more often, some new insight              
              into the structure of the combinatorial class involved.  These                 
              structure questions are in the realm of well-known open problems               
              in discrete mathematics, graph theory, group theory, and                       
              combinatorics.  It is these type of problems that Professor                    
              Savage will address.                                                           
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
