Abstract    :
              9302101 Kelly The dynamic performance of lightly damped structural systems
              subjected to wind or earthquake excitation can be significantly enhanced by the
              use of tuned mass dampers (TMD).  The objective of this project is to develop
              an innovative multidisciplinary approach to mass damping through the use of
              mechanical devices which provide triangular hysteresis loops as a means of
              dissipating energy in TMD systems.  For enhanced performance through active
              control, real time tuning mechanisms for these hysteretic mass dampers will be
              evaluated.  The goals include: (i) identification of optimal hysteresis for
              mass dampers systems under seismic and wind excitation; (ii) development of
              semi active control techniques to further enhance mass damping performance; and
               (iii) construction of devices implementing the optimal hysteretic behavior and
              verification building system performance by earthquake simulator testing. 
              Support for the construction of the hysteretic mechanical devices will be
              provided by two commercial firms.  To accomplish both of these objectives the
              research team conducting this work will use a combination of conceptual and
              computational techniques combined with rigorous experimental modeling
              techniques.  All research and development for this program will be provided by
              a collaborative effort of both practicing engineers and academic researchers.
