Abstract    :
              9302788  Kennedy  This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support the  collaboration
              of Christina Kennedy of the University of  Arizona and Johanna Dobereiner of
              EMBRAPA in Rio de Janeiro,  Brazil.  The project aims to isolate and mutate
              genes of  Azobacter diazotrophicus necessary for nitrogenase enzyme  activity. 
                Nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been isolated from sugar cane  varieties in
              Brazil in which up to 70 percent of total plant  nitrogen comes from
              atmospheric nitrogen (dinitrogen).  The  major organism isolated, A.
              diazotrophicus, is an endophyte  thought to be responsible for the fixation of
              dinitrogen and  transfer of products to the plant system.  The researchers 
              will use mutants unable to fix nitrogen to prove or disprove  a role for this
              species in providing fixed nitrogen in sugar  cane.  They will also
              characterize genes involved in  bacterial responses to environmental factors
              such as ammonia  and oxygen that control nitrogenase biosynthesis.  Strategies
              to increase amounts of fixed nitrogen provided to  plants will be applied to
              construct strains that produce  nitrogenase in the presence of ammonia or have
              increased  tolerance to oxygen.  The U.S. side has expertise in the  genetics
              of nitrogen-fixing bacteria.  The Brazilian  laboratory is where A.
              diazotrophicus was identified and its  colonization of plants is being studied.
               Both sides will  benefit from establishing the significance of a novel and 
              potentially important nitrogen-fixing bacterial species.  ***
