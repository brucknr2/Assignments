Abstract    :
                   This award covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at the University of Massachusetts                 
              Dartmouth in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported                    
              scientists.  The group will finish the analysis of two                         
              experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory and participate                  
              in the construction and operation of a third, a major upgrade                  
              of the multiparticle spectrometer at Brookhaven in order to                    
              study mesonic states with unusual quantum numbers.
