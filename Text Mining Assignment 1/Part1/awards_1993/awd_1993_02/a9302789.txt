Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant will support preliminary studies                  
              into adaptive algorithms to segment gray matter, white matter and              
              cerebrospinal fluid in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images.  The              
              segmentation criteria will be based on intensity and relative                  
              location of pixels.  The intended use of the segmentation                      
              algorithm is to allow accurate measures of brain changes that                  
              occur in Alzheimer's disease to be made.  The Planning Grant will              
              allow the PI to do work on the project for one year to obtain                  
              preliminary results that will form the basis of a full proposal                
              on the topic.
