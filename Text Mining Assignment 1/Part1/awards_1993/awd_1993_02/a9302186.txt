Abstract    :
              9302186 Michener          This project will finish a comprehensive book length
              work on the phylogeny and systematics of bees of the world, with supplementary
              information on nesting and mating behavior, flower preferences and the like. 
              Using parsimony programs, the phylogeny of higher taxa (tribes to families)
              will be investigated and presented.  Keys for identification to the level of
              subgenus will be produced.  This work will be a contribution to the knowledge
              of bee evolution and systematics.  In addition, because bees are essential
              pollinators of many plants and honey bees often are poor pollinators, studies
              of all bees need to be facilitated for agricultural and conservation purposes. 
              This work will make possible bee identification (to the subgenus level) by
              ecologists, botanists, and those concerned with biodiversity (that may be
              limited by loss of pollinators) and will make possible improved understanding
              of bees as a group.  Moreover, the study of bees has had a major impact on the
              conceptual bases of various evolutionarily important phenomena (e.g. altruism
              and sociality).  A comprehensive phylogenetic and systematic treatment will
              provide a framework on which to evaluate such matters, both past work and
              future studies. %%% Because bees are essential pollinators of many plants and
