Abstract    :
                   General Atomics is establishing a connection to NSFNET via                
              56,000 bits per second lines for the San Diego Community College               
              District.  The District comprises three community colleges and                 
              eight continuing education centers.  The connection enables the                
              faculties and students to communicate and collaborate with the                 
              international scientific and educational community, and to access              
              network resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers.             
              This award funds part of the costs for two years.
