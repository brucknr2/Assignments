Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided to allow the PI to continue working on the                  
              vertical incidence and wide angle seismic and geothermal data                  
              collected over a known gas hydrate field on the Blake Ridge and                
              Corlina Rise during two cruises in 1992.  The work will enable,                
              among other, the determination of pressure-temperature conditions              
              over the bottom simulating reflector marking the base of the gas               
              hydrate and constraints on vertical and lateral distribution of the            
              hydrate, which are crucial to the understanding of gas hydrate                 
              occurrence in convergent and passive margins, allowing tests of an             
              in situ and fluid flow model of hydrate formation.
