                       Carbon Cycle                                                          
                                                                                             
              In field studies and in global scale models, it has been difficult             
              to understand how dissolved nutrients are supplied to support the              
              observed discrepancy between eddy diffusive transport and                      
              production demand: (1) the transport of nutrients in the until                 
              recently "invisible" pool of dissolved organic matter; (2) the                 
              transport of inorganic nutrients by episodic mixing or nutrient                
              injection. According to recent work, mesoscale upwelling in the                
              upper ocean associated with fronts and eddies may drive a                      
              significant vertical nutrient transport.  Global scale circulation             
              nutrient cycle models are unable to reproduce the observed nutrient            
              cycle in the upper ocean without recourse to either (1) transport              
              of nutrients in the form of dissolved organic nutrients, or (2)                
              incresased concentrations of inorganic nutrients at the sea                    
              surface, which allows presumably unrealistic horizontal advective              
              transport. GCM results may be biased by inadequate resolution of               
              the mesoscale processes that are responsible for vertical nutrient             
              transport in the real ocean.  To test this hypothesis, a nutrient              
              dynamics model will be run with the physical variables from the                
              eddy-resolving circulation model of Semtner and Chervin (1992).
