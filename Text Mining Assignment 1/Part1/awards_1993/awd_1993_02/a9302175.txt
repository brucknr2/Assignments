Abstract    :
              9302175  Yuen    In this project the PI's will numerically model (2-D and 3-D) 
              convection of fluids in the oceanic crust, convection in the magma  lens
              beneath a ridge axis, and interface dynamics between the low  melt % mush below
              the magma lens above.  Such goals will be  accomplished by the PI's with the
              addition of heat and mass fluxes  to their existing 3-D model using
              high-powered graphics and  supercomputers.
