Abstract    :
              ***  Pasquale  9302387         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop a "wearable" information system for site supervisory
              personnel that provides up-to-date project information such as project
              schedule, design changes, and other project details and enables the supervisor
              to easily and accurately record job progress and site conditions. The
              construction industry has failed to adopt and apply new information system
              technology as quickly as most other industries. Specifically, construction
              field site management and supervision has seen little improvement in techniques
              for data gathering, progress reporting and communications between field sites
              and corporate offices. During this research computer hardware and software will
              be developed that will provide site supervisors with an information management
              tool in a hands-free, voice activated environment. Several "wearable" prototype
              computers will be designed and created using commercially available components
              such as a miniature computer processor, heads-up display monitor, a voice
              recognition system, and a cellular telephone. The system components will be
              fitted to a standard construction hard hat. The prototypes will be field tested
              at construction sites by supervisors managing actual construction projects.
              Results of field testing and evaluation will yield further system refinements
              for use in developing a set of design specifications for future commercial
              product development.       The introduction of a "wearable" information system
              for hands-free, voice activated construction site management could yield great
              benefits in construction site productivity and should lead to reduced errors
              caused by inaccurate or out-dated information. Widespread implementation of
              "wearable" information systems should greatly improve the effectiveness of
              communications on the modern construction site.  ***
