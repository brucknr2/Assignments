Abstract    :
              9302981  Penniston  This U.S.-Argentina Program award will support the
              collaboration  of John Penniston of the Mayo Foundation and Hugo Adamo of the 
              University of Buenos Aires in Argentina.  The project aims to  study mutants of
              the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump.    The researchers will make mutants of the
              plasma membrane Ca2+  pump, express these mutants in COS-1 cells, and study the
               kinetics of these mutants.  They will focus on regions of the  pump where
              alteration of amino acid residues will cause changes  in the activity of the
              pump without totally destroying its  activity.  Such mutants will provide a
              residual activity whose  study will shed light on the structure-function
              relationships in  the Ca2+ pump and on the mechanisms involved in regulating
              Ca2+  transport.  The U.S. group will benefit from the creation and 
              investigation of Ca2+ pump mutants, and from the Argentine  group's expertise
              in the kinetics of the Ca2+ pump.  The  Argentine group will gain from the
              opportunity to make the  mutants.  ***
