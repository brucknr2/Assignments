Abstract    :
                   This award will fund a Mathematical Sciences Research Group               
              in harmonic analysis.  The goal is to sustain a highly                         
              interactive community of mathematicians, including students and                
              young investigators, whose work is related to the shared                       
              interests of the principal investigators.  Those interests are in              
              the general area of function theory, operator theory, and                      
              harmonic analysis.
