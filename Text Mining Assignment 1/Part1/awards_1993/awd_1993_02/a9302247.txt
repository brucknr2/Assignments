Abstract    :
              9302247  Stacey       Habitat fragmentation is one of the most serious factors 
              threatening the preservation of biological diversity.  As a result  of human
              development, once continuous landscapes such as forests  and wetlands have been
              altered and divided into small patches. This  reduces population sizes of the
              plants and animals within each  patch, and may make them more vulnerable to
              extinction.  In this  project, researchers will test predictions of the
              metapopulation  model of Stacey and Taper.  They will study the federally
              listed  Mexican Spotted Owl in New Mexico, and owl whose survival has been 
              threatened by logging and other changes to its habitat.  They  hypothesize that
              small and naturally fragmented populations of this  owl are united by
              dispersal, and that immigration form one  population can "rescue" other
              populations from extinction.  Both  field observations and several new
              molecular genetic techniques  will be used to measure dispersal of juveniles
              and adults among  four adjacent but isolated mountain ranges.  %%%  This Study
              will provide important new information on the role of  dispersal and
              metapopulation structure in the persistence of rare  species in arid
              environments, and new data needed by land  management agencies for the
              development of successful management  plans for the conservation of the Mexican
              Spotted Owl itself.  ***
