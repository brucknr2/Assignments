Abstract    :
              PISIAS  9302147  This project will use stable isotopes and assemblages of two
              groups of microfossils to provide a detailed reconstruction of surface water
              circulation in the eastern equatorial Pacific through the Pliocene. The authors
              hypothesize that closing of the Isthmus of Panama led to conditions which
              created the warm fresh pool of water observed in the area today, and that the
              pool in turn is responsible for the modern equatorially-asymmetric circulation.
              They hope to determine the relationship of these events to the increase of
              northern hemisphere glaciation documented elsewhere.
