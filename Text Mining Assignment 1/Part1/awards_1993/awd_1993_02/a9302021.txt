Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor A. Sommese to               
              work on the applications of algebraic geometry to numerical                    
              analysis and problems in linkages.  In particular problems arising             
              from the theory of over-constrained mechanisms.                                
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the            
              oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the             
              point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have            
              stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the             
              plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the             
              field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis               
              and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those                   
              fields, but it has applications to many areas of engineering as                
              well.  The research supported in the present proposal shows the                
              importance of this once purely theoretical area for robotics and               
              manufacturing.
