Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of W. McCallum and D. Ulmer              
              to work in arithmetic geometry. Professor McCallum will study                  
              descent on Fermat's curve. Professor Ulmer will study the p-adic               
              valuations of coefficients of modular forms as well as the                     
              Iwasawa theory for elliptic curves.                                            
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
