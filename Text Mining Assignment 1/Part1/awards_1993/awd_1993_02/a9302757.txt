Abstract    :
              9302757  Starmer       This project will investigate the genetic basis of female
               egg laying behavior in conjunction with the performance of her  offspring in a
              well studied species of Drosophila (D. buzzatii).   Females of this species are
              known to display different  preferences for laying their eggs on different
              microorganisms  (yeasts) in the laboratory and in the field.  These preferences
               are at least partly under genetic influence.  Understanding the  benefits of
              the mother's preferences to the offspring could  explain several important
              aspects of evolutionary ecology such as  1) the maintenance of genetic
              diversity, 2) the evolution of  host-specialization and 3) the origin of
              species.%%%       Experiments will compare female egg laying behavior to the 
              performance of her larvae with attention to both environmental  and genetic
              aspects.  Four distinct strains of D. buzzatii  representing independent
              genetically determined egg laying  responses to yeast species that grow in the
              natural habitat will  be used.  The experiments are designed to approximate the
               biological  situation as we know it from extensive field studies.  
              Interpretations  about genetically based behavior should be  useful to basic
              biology, evolutionary ecology, applied aspects of  conservation biology and
              biological control of insect pests.  ***
