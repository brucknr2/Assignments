Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Longyearbyen Optical Station is the only ground station in            
              the northern hemisphere with regular scheduled airline service                 
              which permits 24 hour observation of the aurora and airglow.  The              
              EISCAT radar polar cap extension will be built a few miles from the            
              observatory site.  This proposal seeks funding for maintenance of              
              Longyearbyen in support of the CEDAR and GEM programs so that it               
              will provide a ready location for continued high latitude optical              
              studies.  The station has supported investigations of dayside and              
              nightside aurora, ionospheric currents, high latitude dynamics of              
              the thermosphere and mesosphere and also measurements of                       
              stratospheric minor constituents connected with the ozone cycle.               
              In collaboration with the University of Tromso, the University of              
              Alaska has developed the station to a modern research facility in              
              the Arctic tundra complete with a set of first class optical and               
              magnetic instruments, individual observing bays for visitors, areas            
              for setup and repair, and comfortable living conditions.  The PIs              
              plan the continuation of this work with centrally supported                    
              maintenance of the station and its instrument complement.
