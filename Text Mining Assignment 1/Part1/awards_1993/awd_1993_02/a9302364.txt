Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an equivalent grant, to assist the purchase of a stable                
              isotope mass spectrometer for analysis of oxygen and carbon                    
              isotopes in calcareous material, mostly in planktonic foraminafera.            
              Data are used to determine effects of environmental parameters such            
              as light, temperature, and food supply upon formation of a                     
              calcareous skeleton.  When these relationships are known, they can             
              be applied to fossil material to reconstruct environmental                     
              conditions in the past.
