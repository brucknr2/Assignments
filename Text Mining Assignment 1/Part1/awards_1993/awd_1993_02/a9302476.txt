Abstract    :
               This research is centered on the design of efficient  approximation algorithms
              for a wide variety of combinatorial  optimization  problems.  The main goal is
              to develop and  isolate general techniques which  lead to approximation 
              algorithms, to improve the currently best performance  guarantees for several
              combinatorial optimization problems  and to develop  efficient implementations
              for these  algorithms.    During the past few years  substantial progress has
              been made  in these directions; in particular, the  development of a  general
              approximation technique based on a primal-dual  approach which lead to the
              first and/or best approximation  algorithm for a  variety of problems including
              the weighted  matching problem, the  prize-collecting traveling salesman 
              problem, the generalized Steiner tree  problem and the most  general version of
              the graph augmentation problem.  This  research has demonstrated the usefulness
              of linear  programming techniques in  deriving approximation algorithms. 
              Linear programming is one of the main tools  that is to be  used in this
              project in order to derive improved  approximation  algorithms.
