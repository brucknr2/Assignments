Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  As part of the Arctic Noctilucent Cloud Campaign-93, the PIs              
              propose to make aircraft-borne and ground-based spectroscopic                  
              observations of the hydroxyl infrared nightglow as well as                     
              photographic observations of NLC.  These will be done to                       
              investigate the residual gravity and planetary wave fields present             
              during the Arctic summer and their possible relationship to the                
              formation of mesospheric clouds.  The intent is to measure the OH              
              nightglow radiance and temperature from the NCAR aircraft.  This               
              will be done both to characterize the mesosphere in the NLC and PMC            
              regions and to examine the relationship of the mesospheric clouds              
              detected by the aircraft Lidar to the geographical characteristics             
              of the OH gravity waves and planetary-scale disturbances.  Next,               
              the PIs propose to characterize the polar summer mesosphere                    
              throughout the campaign with observations of the OH nightglow                  
              radiance and temperature from ground stations located at about                 
              60oN.  These measurements will be used to examine the temporal                 
              behavior of gravity waves and planetary scale disturbances and will            
              provide the context within which the aircraft data may be                      
              interpreted.  Finally, the presence of NLC will be photographically            
              documented over the ground stations in order to determine the                  
              occurrence frequency, extent, altitude and the structure and                   
              morphology of the NLC.
