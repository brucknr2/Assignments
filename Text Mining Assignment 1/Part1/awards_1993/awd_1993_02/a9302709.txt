Abstract    :
                   Stroock works in the area of diffusion processes.  In                     
              particular, he is studying the Glauber dynamics associated with                
              lattice gases.  Recently, these studies have led to the use of                 
              logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, thus bringing together two                   
              different areas of mathematics.  Stroock will continue his                     
              research in these areas.                                                       
                   Stroock works on various aspects of stochastic analysis and               
              its applications to other fields.  At present, his major interest              
              is in mathematical models of the statistical mechanics of gases.               
              In particular, he has been studying a class of dynamical systems               
              which are sufficiently simple that they are mathematically                     
              tractable and are sufficiently intricate to be physically                      
              intriguing.  In addition to physics, these same dynamics arise in              
              other contexts as models of interacting systems of huge systems                
              of particles.
