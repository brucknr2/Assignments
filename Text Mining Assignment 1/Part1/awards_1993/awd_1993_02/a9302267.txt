Abstract    :
              9302267  George  This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award will support
               US participation in an International Workshop on Hierarchical  Modeling, to be
              held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August 1993.   The US organizer is Edward
              George of the University of Texas at  Austin, and the Brazilian organizer is
              Dani Gamerman of the  Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.  The Workshop aims
              to bring  together leading international researchers who are active in 
              hierarchical modeling research.    The symposium's primary objectives are to
              facilitate the exchange  of recent research developments and to establish
              collaborative  ties that will channel efforts toward pending problems and open 
              new directions for investigation.  The organizers also hope to  further
              crystallize hierarchical modeling as an established area  for statistical
              research.  Eleven senior and seven junior US  participants--including four
              women--will be supported through  this award.  The proceedings will be
              disseminated via papers and  a comprehensive final report.  All sides are
              expected to benefit  from the exchange of information and development of future
               research ties.    ***
