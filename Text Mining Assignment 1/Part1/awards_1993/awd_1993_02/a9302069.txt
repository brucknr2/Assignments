Abstract    :
                   We will continue our research into the mechanisms by which                
              mineral surfaces interact with an aqueous solution during                      
              corrosion.  In particular, we will determine the enthalpy                      
              contribution to the activation energy (Eexp) for mineral dissolution           
              that arises from the rapid acid-base reactions which precede the               
              rate-controlling step in dissolution.  These acid-base reactions               
              impart a distinct pH-dependence of the overall reaction.  In                   
              research funded under EAR-910583, we showed that the enthalpy                  
              arising from acid-base reactions is the largest contribution to the            
              Eexp (Casey and Sposito, 1992).  This contribution varies                      
              considerably with pH and temperature, and is poorly constrained for            
              silicate minerals.  This research is important because atomistic               
              models of the reaction energetics , such as molecular-orbital                  
              calculations (e.g., Casey et al., 1990), employ Eexp values as a               
              gauge of the model accuracy.                                                   
                   We also will indirectly probe the elementary step reaction                
              controlling dissolution of simple minerals containing first-row                
              transition metals.  We predict that the affect of certain rate-                
              enhancing ligands on the dissolution rates of these minerals will              
              differ systematically and predictable with the delectronic                     
              structure of bonds to oxygen.  This prediction arises from                     
              differences in the activation entropies and activation volumes of              
              solvent exchange reactions around corresponding dissolved metal                
              complexes.  In previous work (e.g., Casey, 1991; Casey and                     
              Westrich, 1992) we found a close correspondence between reactivity             
              trends for solvent-exchange reactions and metal removal from a                 
              dissolving oxide or orthosilicate mineral surface.
