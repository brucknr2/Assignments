Abstract    :
              Dr. Deborah S. Wuttke has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                 
              Fellowship In Chemistry. Dr. Wuttke's doctoral degree was from                 
              the California Institute of Technology under the supervision of                
              Professor Harry Gray. Dr. Wuttke will continue research at the                 
              Scripps Research Institute under the sponsorship of Professor                  
              Peter Wright. Dr. Wuttke's postdoctoral training will focus on                 
              nuclear magnetic resonance studies of complex biological                       
              systems. Longer term, she plans to study molecular recognition                 
              of oligonucleotides by proteins and protein/protein and                        
              protein/peptide interactions involved in antibody/antigen                      
              recognition.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
