Abstract    :
              Langmuir  9302933                             This project offers a different
              twist to the ongoing saga of  mid-oceanic ridges. The P.I.s will analyze a
              selcted set of MORB  glasses away from and close to hot spots for their water
              contents  by infrared spectroscopy. They will determine Cl by electron probe 
              at LDGO. The purpose is to evaluate how water relates to other  geochemical
              pararneters and what role it plays in melt generation  at MOR.
