Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Hayes to work in            
              number theory.  Professor Hayes will be addressing Stark's                     
              conjectures in class field theory.  These conjectures are an                   
              ingenious and highly original answer to the questions raised by the            
              famous 12 problem of Hilbert.  Professor Hayes has given                       
              constructed proofs of the abelian Stark conjectures in function                
              fields and he now hopes to apply his insights to the number field              
              case.                                                                          
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number theory            
              starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                        
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
