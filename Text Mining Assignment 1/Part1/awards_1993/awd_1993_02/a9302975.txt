Abstract    :
                   Professor Pappas will work in arithmetic geometry                         
              specifically the theory of bad reduction of Shimura varieties                  
              concentrating on the case of Hilbert Modular varieties. He will                
              also study the Galois structure of DeRham cohomology groups of                 
              arithmetic varieties.                                                          
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                      
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
