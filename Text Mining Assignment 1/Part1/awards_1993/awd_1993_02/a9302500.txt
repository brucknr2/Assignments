Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  The project supports the visit of                                
              a scientist from Bangladesh, Dr. M.A. Bhuiyan,                                 
              Department of Water Resources Engineering,                                     
              Bangladesh University of Engineering and                                       
              Technology in Dhaka, to participate in research                                
              with Dr. M. Hanif Chaudhry, at the Albrook                                     
              Hydraulics Laboratory at Washington State                                      
              University.  Dr. Bhuiyan will participate in                                   
              the development and verification of a                                          
              mathematical model for the unsteady two-                                       
              dimensional free-surface flow with shocks and                                  
              bores.  The model will be based on finite-                                     
              element method.  Experimental data will be                                     
              obtained on an existing test facility.                                         
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project provides for participation                                
              of a highly qualified young scientist from a                                   
              developing country in multi-faceted research in                                
              a well established, modern, U.S. laboratory in                                 
              the area of hydraulics.  His expertise in                                      
              finite element analysis of unsteady flows will                                 
              benefit the U.S. research effort, while he                                     
              gains experimental skills and knowledge in this                                
              important field.  It is hoped that this will                                   
              lead to further substantial joint research                                     
              involving scientists from the two institutes in                                
              the area of fluid flow, and especially in flood                                
              research and management.
