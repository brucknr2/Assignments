Abstract    :
                   The mapping class group of a closed surface acts on                       
              compactified Teichmuller space.  The topology of this space, as                
              well as the dynamics of this action, are well understood and give              
              information about global properties of the mapping class group.                
              For example, it satisfies the Tits alternative.  The project is                
              to continue an analogous study of the outer automorphism group of              
              the free group via its action on compactified outer space.                     
              Points in Outer Space are equivalence classes of simplicial                    
              metric trees.  The compactifying points are classes of real                    
              trees, objects obtained from degenerations of simplicial trees.                
                   Groups abound in the physical sciences because they arise as              
              the set of symmetries of an object.  There is a special group,                 
              called the free group, from which all others may be constructed.               
              The project is to continue the investigation of the basic                      
              structure of the free group.  The technique is to use tools                    
              recently developed by E. Rips and generalized by the investigator              
              with M. Bestvina.
