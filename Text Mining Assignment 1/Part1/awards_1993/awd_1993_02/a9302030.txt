Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant will provide                  
              resources to the principal investigator to assist him in the                   
              preparation of a regular proposal in the area of magnetic                      
              multilayers.  The principal investigator has been very effective in            
              establishing research collaborations with several institutions,                
              including the University of Texas, Austin, and the Naval Research              
              Laboratory, Washington, D.C.
