Abstract    :
              James H. Gilchrist has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                    
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Gilchrist's doctoral degree was                   
              from Cornell University under the supervision of Professor                     
              David Collum. Dr. Gilchrist will continue research at the                      
              California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of                    
              Professor John Bercaw. Dr. Gilchrist's postdoctoral training                   
              will provide him with skills in the synthetic and physical                     
              chemistry of transition metal compounds. Specifically, he will                 
              study platinum-mediated alkane activation processes. Longer                    
              term he plans to investigate the transition metal catalyzed                    
              coupling of carbonyl compounds to alkenes.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
