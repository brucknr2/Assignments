Abstract    :
              This grant is for the partial support of a symposium on dynamic                
              failure mechanics of modern materials to be held during November               
              18-20, 1993 at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena,               
              CA.  The symposium will allow the presentation of state-of-the-                
              art research findings in the area of dynamic failure mechanics of              
              modern materials to the most outstanding and active workers in                 
              that emerging field from academe, government laboratories and                  
              industry.  This field differs in scope from other branches of                  
              failure mechanics by placing a heavy emphasis on micromechanics                
              and material characterization, and the interaction between macro               
              and micro mechanical aspects of dynamic failure.  A critical                   
              assessment will also be made of the existing high speed recording              
              methods and the accuracy of their predictions.
