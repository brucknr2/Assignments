Abstract    :
                   The main topics of this research are empirical processes and              
              bootstrap.  The investigator will consider applications of the                 
              limit theorems of empirical processes in statistics, in                        
              particular to the asymptotics of M-estimators and U-quantiles.                 
              He also will consider the "rates of convergence" in some limit                 
              theorems, such us the rate of convergence of the bootstrap                     
              central limit theorem  of U-quantiles and the Bahadur--Kiefer                  
              representations for M-estimators. One problem, which he is                     
              exploring, is the study of the central (and non-central) limit                 
              theorems for empirical processes under long range dependence.                  
                   This research is in statistics and probability.  Probability              
              theory will be used to learn how to deal with data which is not                
              independent.  Some applications to statistics which will be                    
              considered are the study of the speed of convergence of certain                
              estimators and of certain statistical procedures.
