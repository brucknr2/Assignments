Omoto, Department of Genetics and Cel lular Biology, Washington State University in Pullman.  Professor Omoto will undertake a twelve month cooperative project.  She will split her visit between three different institutions.  First, she will visit Dr. Ritsu Kamiya, Zoological institute, University of Tokyo.  She will then proceed to Osaka to undertake research with Dr. Toshio Yanagida, Department of Biophysical Engineering, Osaka University.  Finally, she will visit Tsukuba to collaborate with Dr. Takashi Shimizu, Laboratory of Life Science and Technology, Research Institute for Polymers and Textiles.  The collaboration between these researchers is aimed at investigating dynein microtubule chemomechanical transduction, that is, how the chemical energy of ATP is transduced by dynein to produce mechanical force along the microtubule.  The research focuses on using ATP analogs, that are good probes for the dynein chemomechanical cycle, along with a highly sophisticated mechanical measuring instrument available at Tokyo University.  This instrument allows for measurement of high frequency nanometer scale movements and has revealed movements of the axoneme previously unrecognized.  The use of analogs and dynein mutants and the ability to make mechanical measurements will reveal important features necessary for dynein microtubule chemomechanical function.  Results of the research have the potential for increasing fundamental knowledge of microtubule mediated motility in its biological context.  The research can additionally serve as a useful model for novel biomaterials and nonofabrication of biologically inspired micro/nano sensors or micro/nano switches.  Dr. Kamiya is a molecular biologist noted for his measurements of high frequency nanometer vibrations and the facilities in his lab at the University of Tokyo are considered the best in the country.  Dr. Yanagida is a renown biophysicist in the area of mechanochemical coupling of actomyosin.  His laboratory at Osaka University has done considerable work in this area.  Dr. Shimizu is a  noted biochemist in the area of dynein function and dynein hydrolytic activity.  The Laboratory of Life Sciences and Technology is well equipped to do protein biochemistry and enzyme kinetic analyses.  It is believed that the excellent research experiences of these Japanese researchers, coupled with Professor Omoto's expertise in the area, should provide for a very productive study and continued on going collaborations upon completion of the formal agreement.
