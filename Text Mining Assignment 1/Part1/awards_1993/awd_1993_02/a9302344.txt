Abstract    :
              This project will support collaborative research by American                   
              and European researchers on the foundations of object-oriented                 
              programming languages by providing funding for a joint                         
              NSF/ESPRIT workshop to be held in Williamstown, Massachusetts,                 
              USA, in the summer of 1993.  Topics to be covered in the                       
              workshop include the design, semantics, type systems, and                      
              verification of object-oriented programming languages.
