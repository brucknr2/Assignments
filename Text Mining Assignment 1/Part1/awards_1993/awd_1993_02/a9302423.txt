Abstract    :
              Dr. Michael E. Kort has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                   
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Kort earned his Ph.D. degree at                   
              the University of Wisconsin under the supervision of Professor                 
              Steven Burke.  Dr. Kort will continue research at the                          
              California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of                    
              Professor Andrew Myers. Dr. Kort's postdoctoral training will                  
              provide him skills in advanced synthetic strategies,                           
              manipulation of DNA, and the application of high-field NMR to                  
              organic synthesis.  Longer term, Dr. Kort plans to study the                   
              stereoselective synthesis of the enediyne class of anticancer                  
              antibiotics.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
