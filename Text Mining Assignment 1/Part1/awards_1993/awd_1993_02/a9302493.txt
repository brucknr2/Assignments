Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research is to examine the atomic structure,               
              growth mechanisms, and kinetics of precipitate interfaces in metal             
              alloys for comparison with theoretical models that have been                   
              developed to describe interfacial structure and growth kinetics of             
              interphase boundaries.  High resolution transmission electron                  
              microscopy (HRTEM) is used to determine the three-dimensional                  
              atomic structure of precipitate plates in thin foil specimens both             
              parallel and perpendicular to the habit plane.  Atomic mechanisms              
              and kinetics of interface growth are determined by in situ hot                 
              stage HRTEM experiments and compared to hot stage experiments on               
              thicker specimens in a high voltage TEM where the role of surface              
              effects on the transformation are minimized.  Resulting kinetic                
              measurements are compared with kinetic models of precipitate                   
              growth.  Three different types of alloy systems are selected for               
              the studies.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The knowledge generated in this program is fundamental to the                  
              understanding of the properties of interphase boundaries in solids.            
                                                                                             
              This understanding can be applied to tailoring the properties of               
              technologically useful materials.
