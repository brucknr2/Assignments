Abstract    :
              930259  CHISHOLM    Planktonic size spectra (the distribution of total biomass
              among  different size classes) are a manifestation of the structure and 
              function of pelagic ecosystems. As such, they embody information  which could
              be useful for understanding the regulation of  productivity in different
              biogeochemical provinces of the oceans.  They also contain information
              essential to formulating algorithms  to interpret satellite ocean color
              measurements. The overall goal  of this project is to study, through
              observation and  experimentation, how the characteristics of planktonic size
              spectra  vary in different regions of the oceans and to determine what the 
              underlying mechanisms are that generate and maintain them.    Flow cytometry
              will be used to develop automated techniques for the  generation of pelagic
              size spectra in the 0.3 to 100 micrometer  size range, allowing one to measure
              size and abundance of  picoplankton, phytoplantkon, bacteria, and
              microzooplankton. Once  developed these methods will be applied to studies in a
              variety of  different oceanographic regimes under a variety of different 
              conditions.  ***
