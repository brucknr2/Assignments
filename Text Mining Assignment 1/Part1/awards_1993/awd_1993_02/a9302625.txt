Abstract    :
              This project will study calibration of thermodynamic models for                
              prediction of the composition and volume of basaltic melts formed              
                                                                                             
              during adiabatic upwelling of the mantle, with applications to the             
                                                                                             
              petrogenesis of Mid-ocean Ridge Basalts (MORB) and oceanic island              
                                                                                             
              basalts and to the origin of oceanic crust.  This study will                   
              provide a robust predictive tool for exploring the effects of                  
              mantle composition, temperature, and pressure on the composition               
                                                                                             
              and volume of melt produced.  It will generate a link between                  
              mantle phase equilibria and the energy balances that drive the                 
              dynamics of the upper mantle undergoing melting.
