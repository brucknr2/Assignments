Abstract    :
              9302050  Fritts         The Hawaiian MF radar installed on Kauai, Hawaii in
              September  1990 will be used together with other airborne and ground-based 
              systems to address large- and small-scale dynamics and coupling  processes,
              including vertical propagation of and interactions among  gravity wave and
              tidal motions, variability of gravity waves in  response to localized source
              regions, the interactions and  variability of large-scale tidal and two-day
              notions, and mean and  variable wave forcing of the equatorial middle
              atmosphere.   Correlative analyses with lidars and airglow instrumentation in 
              Hawaii and aboard the NCAR Electra will be useful in examining  spatial and
              temporal variability of the gravity wave field and  vertical propagation and
              effects.  Correlations with MF and MEDAC  radar systems across the equatorial
              Pacific and in Puerto Rico will  provide valuable data on the tidal and two-day
              wave motions and  their variability.  ***
