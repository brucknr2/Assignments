Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This proposed conference, organized by North Carolina                          
              Central University and Cairo University, is scheduled for                      
              24-28 May 1993 in Alexandria, Egypt.  The topic of the                         
              conference is the interaction of ergodic theory with                           
              harmonic analysis. Participants will come from the Middle                      
              East, Europe, and the U.S. Prior to the start of the                           
              conference (May 17-22), a series of short courses in                           
              Ergodic Theory, Harmonic Analysis, and Number Theory                           
              will be held in order to provide the necessary background                      
              for mathematicians who have not been introduced to this                        
              new and exciting area of research.  This proposal supports                     
              the participation of approximately 10 U.S.                                     
              mathematicians. Conference participants will present                           
              papers that will be compiled and published as a                                
              conference volume.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This conference in mathematical sciences fulfills the                          
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading experts in the United States, Egypt and                       
              elsewhere to combine complementary talents and present                         
              research results in areas of strong mutual interest and                        
              competence.  This conference has an educational and                            
              outreach effort that has the potential for generating new                      
              scientific activity and new international linkages.
