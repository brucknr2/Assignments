Abstract    :
              9302150  TAKAHASHI    CFCs (CFC-11., -12 and -113) and CO2 (total CO2
              concentration and  pCO2) will be measured in seawater during the French
              CONFLUENCE  program in the western South Atlantic Ocean between 35.0S and 43.5S
               in collaboration with Dr. Veronique Garcon of Observatoir Midi-  Purenees,
              CNRS, Toulouse, and Dr. Christine Provost of Universite  P.-et-M.  Curie,
              Paris.  The French Research Vessel Le Suroit has  been scheduled for the
              expedition, December 1993, through January  1994, and the ship's time and
              hydrographic program have been funded  by CNRS. The Scientific objectives of
              the proposed study are as  follows: 1) Investigate ventilation of the South
              Atlantic  subtropical gyre thermocline waters by the mode waters using CFCs 
              and minimum potential vorticity as tracers.  Since near surface  waters in the
              confluence zone are highly undersaturated with  respect to atmospheric CO2, the
              CO2 uptake and transport by the  mode waters can be estimated using these
              chemical and physical  tracers.  2) In intermediate depths, a CFC maximum is
              associated  with the salinity minimum of AAIW.  The circulations pathway and 
              time of formation of AAIW will be investigated using CFCs. 3) The  data
              obtained during the 1988-89 SAVE program show that the western  boundary
              undercurrent which flows poleward along the Argentine  continental slopes at a
              depth of about 2000 meters exhibits a local  minimum in CO2 and CFC.  These
              signals have been traced from 10S to  about 35S. Temporal and spatial changes
              in the CFC and CO2 signals  will help to understand the spreading processes of
              NADW in the  South Atlantic.  4) High CFC values have been detected in bottom 
              waters entering into the Argentine Basin from the South Georgia  Basin. These
              CFCs will be measured in the bottom water in order to  learn its spreading
              pathway in the Argentine Basin.
