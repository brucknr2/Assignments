Abstract    :
              Scott H. Elder has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                        
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Elder's doctoral dcegree was from                 
              Cornell University under the supervision of Professor Frank                    
              DiSalvo. Dr. Elder will continue his research at the University                
              of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship of Professor                   
              Neil Bartlett. Dr. Elder's postdoctoral training will provide                  
              him with skills in preparing solid state fluorides including                   
              handling and manipulation of HF and elemental fluorine as well                 
              as advanced characterization methods. Longer term, he plans to                 
              develop new synthetic strategies for preparing new solid state                 
              nitridofluorides and sulfidofluorides. These little-studied                    
              compounds are expected to show a high degree of covalency and                  
              tunable electronic and magnetic properties.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
