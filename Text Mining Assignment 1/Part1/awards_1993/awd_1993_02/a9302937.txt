Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support a U.S.-                               
              Mexico workshop on conservation problems of                                    
              neotropical migrant birds. The workshop, jointly                               
              organized by Dr. Steven Sader of the University                                
              of Maine and Dr. A. Estrada of the Institute of

              Mexico (UNAM), will advance our understanding of                               
              neotropical migrant bird ecology and develop                                   
              strategies for coordination of cooperative                                     
              research, conservation, monitoring, and training                               
              programs.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Breeding Bird Survey in North America has                                  
              shown that populations of several neotropical                                  
              migrant birds have declined drastically over the                               
              last 10 years.  Various studies point to the loss                              
              of habitat both on breeding and wintering grounds                              
              as a major cause of these declines.  Because                                   
              neotropical migrants are a shared resource                                     
              between Mexico and the United States, bilateral                                
              strategies are fundamental for the conservation                                
              of these species.  Expected outcomes of this                                   
              workshop are greater coordination of the                                       
              monitoring of avian populations and habitats,                                  
              identification of conservation strategies,                                     
              training and research needs and of opportunities                               
              for future collaboration, and a publication of                                 
              the proceedings of the workshop.
