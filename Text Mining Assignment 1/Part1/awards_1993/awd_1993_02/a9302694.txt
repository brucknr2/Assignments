Abstract    :
              This project will: (a) Investigate the effects of weathering and                
                                                                                            
              hydrothermal circulation on Re-OS isotope systematics; (b) Test the            
                                                                                             
              potential for high-precision geochronology on young rocks using                
              the Re-Os dating system; and (c) Investigate the degree of                     
              involvement of the continental crust during the formation of flood             
                                                                                             
              basalt.  Results from this investigation should bear significantly             
                                                                                             
              on the use of the Re-Os isotopic system as a chronometer and offer             
                                                                                             
              new information for the Os isotopic composition of the mantle and
