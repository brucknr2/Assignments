Abstract    :
              The purpose of this interagency agreement is to provide funds for              
              the participation of NASA's ER-2 research aircraft and the                     
              requisite personnel for the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment              
              (CEPEX).  This experiment is scheduled to take place in March 1993             
              in the tropical Pacific.  The ER-2 will fly at approximately 60,000            
              feet (above the clouds) and will serve as the observational                    
              platform for a suite of instruments that will obtain measurements              
              of radiation, moisture, ozone, and various cloud thickness.
