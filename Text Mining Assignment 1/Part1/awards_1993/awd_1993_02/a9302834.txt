Abstract    :
              9302834  Burns       The Westnet mid-level network is connecting 14 institutions
              to  NSFNET via 56,000 bits per second lines.  One community college is  in
              Idaho, one in Colorado, two are in New Mexico and tow in Utah.   Eight of the
              institutions are public libraries in Utah.  The  connections enable the
              schools' faculties and students to  communicate and collaborate with the
              international scientific and  educational community, and to access network
              resources such as  libraries, databases and supercomputers.  The library
              connections  will provide this capability to the general public and to students
               during non-school hours.  This award funds part of the costs for  two years.
