Abstract    :
              A theoretical, computational and experimental research program will            
              be undertaken to develop a new framework for plasticity which will             
              be capable of describing the deformation process when the length               
              scale over which there are high strain gradients is too small for              
              the conventional continuum theory of plasticity to explain, yet is             
              large compared to the size of the relevant microstructure (e.g.,               
              dislocation structures or particles).  The main focus of this                  
              investigation will be on the flow strength of materials containing             
              elastic reinforcements (i.e., metal-matrix composites) and the                 
              manner in which these reinforcements interact with the matrix flow             
              field over a wide range of size scales.
