Abstract    :
              9302812  JENKINS      Understanding of the physical processes affecting gases in
              the  upper ocean is important for quantifying biogeochemical cycles in  the
              upper ocean.  Time series measurements of dissolved gas  concentrations in the
              upper ocean, which respond to changes in  atmosphere-ocean "forcing" have
              proven effective in studying gas  exchange rates.  This project will develop
              and deploy a moored  sequential noble gas sampling system which will permit the
               determination of a time series of noble gas concentrations at  several depths
              in the near surface.  The device will be capable of  obtaining between 50 and
              100 samples at predetermined time  intervals over a course of days to months
              (as dictated by the  scientific program).  Samples would be processed in the
              laboratory  using a self-contained, automated vacuum system which would 
              sequentially extract and analyze the stored samples.  The noble  gases
              (He,Ne,Ar and Kr) will be analyzed to document the time  evolution of gas
              concentrations during high wind events, permitting  the quantitative modeling
              of bubble injection and gas exchange  rates at those wind speeds.  This will
              permit the comparison of  models of these important processes on larger scales.
               Comparison  of results with noble gas analyses of conventionally obtained
              water  samples, as well as moored oxygen sensor and total gas devices will  be
              used to evaluate sampler performance and refine models.
