Abstract    :
              9302615  Strzalkowski    From Text Corpora to Text Databases: Research in Text
              Processing  and Retrieval    This is the first year funding of a three-year
              continuing award.   The goal of this research is to explore the potential of
              natural  language processing in automated information retrieval from large, 
              minimally structured text libraries.  This effort includes  development of more
              effective techniques of indexing, routing,  contents approximation, abstracting
              and creation of hierarchical  domain maps from textual data.  Both linguistic
              and statistical  methods are used.  The main trust is to find satisfactory
              solutions  to the following problems: (1) obtaining an accurate and versatile 
              representation of database contents for search purposes; and (2)  devising
              algorithms that can accomplish this task with the speed  and robustness to
              match or exceed that of statistical systems.  In  order to create an accurate
              representation of database contents  that would be able to support various
              types of search, an extensive  natural language processing component is
              created.  Linguistic  processing includes stochastic part of speech tagging,
              dictionary-  assisted stemming, syntactic parsing, phrase extraction and 
              disambiguation, and semantic correlation of concepts underlying the  database
              domain.  This research is based extensively on empirical  experiments with
              large text collections.  It is expected to produce  technologies that will
              significantly improve the expected  performance levels for top-of-the-line
              full-text information  retrieval systems.   ***
