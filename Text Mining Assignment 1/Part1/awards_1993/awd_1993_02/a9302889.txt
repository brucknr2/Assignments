Abstract    :
              9302889 Marinus Errors of DNA replication are potentially a major source of
              spontaneous and drug   induced mutation.  Repair systems exist to minimize such
              damage.  The best understood is DNA adenine methylation (Dam)   directed
              mismatch repair in Escherichia coli.  Among the proteins involved in this
              repair system, three (MutH, MutL and MutS) are of particular importance.  These
              three proteins appear to form a complex in vivo with DNA containing a
              replication error.  MutL and MutS protein homologs have been detected in other
              bacteria, yeast, mouse and man indicating that the same basic repair mechanism
              is used.  This work is defining, in E. coli, how the MutL protein interacts
              with the other Mut proteins (MutS and MutH) using genetic methods coupled with
              biochemical assays.  Dominant negative mutations in the mutL gene will be
              selected by a newfangled procedure and will be mapped by DNA sequencing.  The
              mutants will be sorted into different classes by their ability to be
              complemented in trans by MutS, MutH and MutL.  Partially purified MutL from
              representative mutants will be assayed in vitro for ability to assemble and
              form a complex (MutH, L, S,) capable of incising DNA.  This will test for the
              ability to associate with and activate MutH endonuclease activity.  We will
              also test for the ability to interact with MutS using DNAse I protection assays
              ("footprinting").  These biochemical assays will then allow correlations to be
              made between location of the mutation in the gene and functional activity of
              protein domains. %%% This research represents a way not only to increase our
              knowledge about how mutations are prevented but also to understand in general
              how proteins assemble  into functional complexes, ***
