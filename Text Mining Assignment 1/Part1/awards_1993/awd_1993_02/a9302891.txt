Abstract    :
              This research seeks to understand the relationship between                     
              perceived risks and emergency events better through an                         
              exploratory effort focused on data collection and analysis.  The               
              study explores how prior risk perceptions affect public response               
              to a specific hazard, and compiles a data set of public                        
              perceptions of risk during and after a significant fire at the                 
              Champion Chemical facility in Odessa, Texas.  The two primary                  
              goals of this research are to examine the effect that emergencies              
              have on the perceptions of risk among nearby residents, and to                 
              analyze the impact of perceived risks on emergency responses                   
              during an chemical accident.  The study takes advantage of                     
              research conducted in the Spring of 1992 on perceived and                      
              acceptable risk in Texas communities.  The pre-event survey data               
              are used in a panel design by re-interviewing respondents in                   
              Odessa and one other Texas community studied in the Spring of                  
              1992.  The collected data will be analyzed to lay the foundation               
              for a more ambitious proposal on the relationship between                      
              experience, and perceived and acceptable risk on the one hand,                 
              and perceptions of risk and emergency responses, on the other.
