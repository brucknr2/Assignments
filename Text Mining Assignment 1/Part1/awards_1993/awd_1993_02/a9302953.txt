Abstract    :
                   This award supports the participation of Dr. James Spinhirne              
              of NASA-Goddard in CEPEX.  CEPEX is a field program that will take             
              place in the tropical Pacific in March 1993.  CEPEX is designed to             
              test the so-called "Thermostat Hypothesis" and involves an                     
              investigation of the regulation of sea surface temperatures in the             
              tropical Pacific through cloud radiative feedback processes and                
              ocean-atmosphere interaction.  Dr. Spinhirne brings to the project             
              his state-of-the-art lidar which will be used to ascertain the                 
              heights and structures of high level clouds and to estimate cloud              
              base.  This instrument is one of several that will be flown on                 
              NASA's high altitude ER-2 aircraft during the experiment.
