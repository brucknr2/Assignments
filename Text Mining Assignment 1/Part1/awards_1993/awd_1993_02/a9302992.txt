Abstract    :
                   The investigator proposes researching fundamental questions               
              concerning Euler-Lagrange Equations in Lagrangian dynamics,                    
              Poisson structures relative to nonholonomic systems and a number               
              of phenomena relating to bifurcations.  Application of the                     
              techniques involved are envisaged in control theory and robotics.
