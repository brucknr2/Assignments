Abstract    :
                   This award supports mathematical research on nonlinear waves              
              inhomogeneous media, focusing on properties of wave front                      
              phenomena arising in nonlinear partial differential equations. In              
              particular reaction-diffusion equations and porous medium type                 
              equations will be treated.  These equations come from premixed                 
              flame propagation problems in combustion theory and solute                     
              transport problems in underground water flow.  Work will be done               
              investigating general reaction-diffusion front propagation in the              
              presence of periodic coefficients under the small diffusion                    
              fast reaction limit.  Also to be studied is the                                
              reaction-diffusion front quenching problem in two dimensions from              
              a numerical point of view and investigations into the existence                
              of reaction-diffusion front propagation in quasiperiodic and                   
              random media. The concentrate front propagation for solute                     
              transport in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media will also be                  
              taken up.                                                                      
                    Partial differential equations form a basis for                          
              mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of                      
              mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as                
              it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about                
              the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about                    
              uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often                
              develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on               
              the accuracy of these approximations.
