Abstract    :
              Technical Abstract: Microwave spectroscopy techniques are                      
              being applied to several areas of condensed matter physics.                    
              The project includes investigations of spin relaxation and                     
              transport at interfaces, high-Tc superconductivity, strong                     
              localization in both random and periodic structures. A new                     
              project undertaken in collaboration with a noted theorist from                 
              AT&T Bell Laboratories will address the area of two-                           
              dimensional electron gas and coupled quantum wells. The                        
              primary theme of the research is the study of transport of                     
              electrons and electromagnetic waves through solid state                        
              structures. The principal investigator has been unusually                      
              successful in carrying these fundamental studies further to                    
              technological areas (funded by other sources) leading to                       
              patent production and stimulation of small business activity.

              Non-Technical Abstract: This project uses microwave radiation                  
              to probe the properties of a wide range of materials, which                    
              include metals, high-Tc superconductors, and semiconductors.                   
              The research focuses on the electrical conductivity and                        
              response of these materials to microwaves. This fundamental                    
              research complements and enables technological projects in                     
              which the principal investigator is involved and which have                    
              lead to patents and techniques stimulating small businesses .
