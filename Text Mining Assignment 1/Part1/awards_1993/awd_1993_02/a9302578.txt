Abstract    :
              9302578  Diebold       A multichannel seismic survey of two areas in the
              Caribbean  will be carried out to study the structure and the genesis and 
              tectonic development of the Carribean Plate.  The deep structure  of the
              Venezuela Basin contains clues necessary to understand the  tectonic evolution
              and the structure of the Beata Ridge is  important for the understanding of how
              the Caribbean has  accomodated the stresses that have resulted in differential 
              strain and plate movements.  High resolution, deep-penetrating  multichannel
              seismic data will be collected to resolve these  issues.  ***
