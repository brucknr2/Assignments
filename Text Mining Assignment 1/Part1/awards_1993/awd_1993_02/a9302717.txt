Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor J. Wahl to                  
              work in algebraic geometry.  One of the problems that Professor                
              Wahl will address will be studying Gaussian maps on K3 surfaces                
              or more generally on possibly singular surfaces with trivial                   
              canonical bundle. He will also continue to study topological                   
              properties of local singularities.                                             
                   This research uses the techniques of algebraic geometry, one              
              of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had               
              a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                  
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                 
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                       
              robotics.
