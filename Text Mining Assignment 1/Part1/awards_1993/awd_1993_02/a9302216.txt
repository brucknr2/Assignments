Abstract    :
                  9302216  Barsoum  One of the major factors restricting the widespread use of
              ultra-  refractory composites for high temperature structural applications  has
              been the difficulty, and associated cost, of producing complex-  shaped
              components from these materials.  Furthermore, both the  difficulty and the
              expense increase dramatically as the  refractoriness of the constituents
              increases.  An innovative  processing technique termed as Transient Plastic
              Phase Processing  (TPPP) will be used for in-situ net-shape manufacturing
              complex-  shaped, fully dense, ultra-refractory composites at temperatures 
              that are about 0.65 of their melting temperatures.  The technique  also has the
              potential of yielding new and as yet unexplored  compositions and
              microstructures that may very well have superior  mechanical, electrical and
              magnetic properties.    The work is a combined
              experimental-modeling-computational research  program to study the
              processing-microstructure/composition-  properties relationships for this new
              class of the mixture of soft  and hard phases, the relationships between
              microstructure and  mechanical properties such as elastic moduli, flexural and 
              compressive strength, fracture toughness, creep resistance and high 
              temperature ductility will be established.  ***
