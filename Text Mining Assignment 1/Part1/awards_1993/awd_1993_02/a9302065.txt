Abstract    :
              9302065  Reich  A series of experiments are proposed to explore the ground state
               properties and excitations of low-dimensional antiferromagnetic  materials
              that exhibit novel cooperative quantum effects.  A zero-  temperature phase
              transition will be explored by varying the  parameters in the Hamiltonian of
              spin-1 chain through the  application of pressure.  A field-induced
              incommensurate soft mode  in the spin-1/2 chain will be studied in detail.  The
              properties of  quantum systems with competing interactions will be examined 
              through experiments on one-dimensional chains with next-nearest  neighbor
              infractions and two-dimensional systems with geometrical  frustration.  The
              research will involve crystal growth and  characterization, low-temperature
              thermodynamic measurements, and  detailed studies of dynamical properties via
              inelastic neutron  scattering.  %%%  This research involves the growth and
              characterization of materials  which have magnetic properties largely
              constrained to occur along  one- or two-dimensions.  The magnetic properties
              become pronounced  at low temperatures, and are also influenced by application
              of  hydrostatic pressure.  The research will provide fundamental  information
              relevant to magnetism, and to the field of high-Tc  superconducting materials. 
              The materials will be investigated  using magnetic measurements and by the
              technique of neutron  scattering which reflects dynamical aspects of the atomic
              magnets  in the various materials.  ***
