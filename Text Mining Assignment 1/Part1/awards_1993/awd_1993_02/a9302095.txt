Abstract    :
              9302095  Lam  This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will 
              support travel, lodging, and communication expenses for six U.S.  participants
              in a First International Conference on Complex  Systems in Computational
              Physics, to be held in Buenos Aires  October 18-22, 1993.  The U.S. organizer
              is Luis Lam of San Jose  State University and Guillermo Marshall of the
              National Atomic  Energy Commission (CNEA) in Argentina.    The conference will
              bring together 200 participants and 24  speakers from the U.S., Latin America,
              Europe, and Japan to  review significant developments and present new research
              results  of complex systems in computational physics, in the context of  very
              large scientific computation.  Such systems include  fractals, chaos, pattern
              formation, neural nets, and cellular  automata.  All sides will benefit from
              the opportunity to  exchange information and identify research priorities.  In 
              particular, U.S.-Argentina collaborative research ties in the  area of complex
              systems are likely to be strengthened.  ***
