Abstract    :
                   Jones will study almost everywhere convergence in analysis                
              and ergodic theory.  He will investigate questions concerning                  
              almost everywhere convergence for absolutely integrable                        
              functions, the central limit theorem on the real line and its                  
              transference to the ergodic setting, and questions related to the              
              solution of an old problem of Hopf.  Singular integral techniques              
              will be further developed and applied.                                         
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
