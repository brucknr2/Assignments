Abstract    :
              Dixon  9302574                             This project offers a different twist
              to the ongoing saga of  mid-oceanic ridges. The P.I.s will analyze a selcted
              set of MORB  glasses away from and close to hot spots for their water contents 
              by infrared spectroscopy. They will determine Cl by electron probe  at LDGO.
              The purpose is to evaluate how water relates to other  geochemical pararneters
              and what role it plays in melt generation  at MOR.
