Abstract    :
              9302122  WARE, Randolph H.       The PIs will use the Global Positioning System
              (GPS) to  monitor crustal motion across a plate boundary complex between the 
              Indo-Australian and Pacific plates.  This complex, which includes  the Hebrides
              arc, the Fiji Plateau, the Lau Basin and the Tonga  arc, is characterized by
              very high rates of plate convergence and  back-arc spreading.  By using GPS to
              establish inter-island  baselines that straddle many of the major tectonic
              elements is the  region, it will be possible, by repeated observation of these 
              baselines, to directly observe the kinematics of plate convergence,  intra-arc
              strain and back-arc spreading.  The consortium that will  perform the
              experiment included North Carolina State University,  Cornell University, the
              University of Texas at Austin, the  University of Colorado, the National
              Geodetic Survey, ORSTOM (New  Caledonia) and the University of New South Wales
              (Australia).
