Abstract    :
                9302526  Fintushel       Since the 1982 work of Simon Donaldson, the principal
               investigator and R. Fintushel have applied gauge theory to study  homology
              3-spheres and smooth 4-manifolds.  The current project  follows in this
              tradition, utilizing the recent work of the  principal investigator and R.
              Fintushel and the recent work of  Taubes, the work of Morgan, Mrowka, and
              Ruberman, and the work of  Kronheimer and Mrowka to determine those operations
              on a given  smooth 4-manifold which preserve its homeomorphism type and alter 
              its diffeomorphism type.  Further, exotic smooth structures will  be
              investigated for those manifolds which have no Donaldson  polynomials, i.e.
              manifolds with Euler characteristic plus  signature not divisible by 4.      
              The major thrust of this project is to classify smooth  simply-connected
              4-manifolds, i.e. objects that are locally  modeled on 4-dimensional space. 
              Relativistic space-time is, of  course, the best known example of such a
              manifold.  Although the  precise global structure of space-time is not known,
              many such  manifolds can be described as solutions to systems of complex 
              polynomials.  Only recently have there been discovered examples  which cannot
              be so described, thus dashing immediate hopes of  classifying 4-manifolds. 
              Because of these examples, there is no  intelligent conjecture as to what form
              this classification might  take.  It is the fundamental purpose of the current
              project to  investigate these and other "exotic 4-manifolds" further and to 
              place them in a larger and less ad hoc framework.  ***
