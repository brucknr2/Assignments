Abstract    :
              The notion of term rewriting was conceived in the late sixties                 
              starting from a seminal paper by Knuth and Bendix.  It later                   
              evolved into a powerful tool bridging between programming                      
              languages and logic in computer science.  In addition to                       
              extensive theoretical results, it has been applied to symbolic                 
              and algebraic computation, automated deduction, programming                    
              languages and compiler optimization, termination and                           
              correctness of programs, grammars, lambda and combinatory                      
              calculi, and has been the catalyst in the inception of                         
              constraint solving and unification theory.  In recent years                    
              studies have also been initiated in using rewriting as a model                 
              for concurrency, as well as a viable solution to combining                     
              functional and logic programming paradigms.                                    
                                                                                             
              Due to the popularity of the subject, there has been an                        
              increase in graduate students studying in areas related to                     
              term rewriting.  This grant is to defray cost of participation                 
              for about fifteen U.S. computer science graduate students.
