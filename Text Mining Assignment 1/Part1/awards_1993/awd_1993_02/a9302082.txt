Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project is a continuation of Kawase's previous studies, on the            
              effect of stratification and upper ocean circulation on the                    
              buoyancy-driven abyssal circulation.  During the course of this                
              program, the PI will:  (1) perform experiments with a multi-layer              
              numerical ocean circulation model under idealized conditions to                
              study the effect of stratification and upper ocean circulation on              
              the buoyancy driven abyssal circulation and, (2) develop a general             
              circulation model of the subtropical South Atlantic based on the               
              same model.  This program is a contribution to the WOCE Deep Basin             
              Experiment recently initiated in the South Atlantic.
