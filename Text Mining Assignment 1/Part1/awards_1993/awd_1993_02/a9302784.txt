Abstract    :
              The tribological behavior of multi-component polymeric composites              
              will be studied, with emphasis on developing optimal materials                 
              combinations for tribological performance.  Particular emphasis                
              will be placed on the possibility of developing beneficial                     
              tribological films from decomposing fillers and solid lubricants               
              added to polymeric materials for use under sliding conditions.                 
              The study will include synthesis of materials with fillers                     
              selected on basis of bonding strength, electronegativity, and                  
              heat of formation; with PTFE lubricant additions; and with carbon              
              fiber reinforcements.  The nature of the transfer film and its                 
              rate of formation will be investigated and correlated with the                 
              tribological events during sliding and with tribological                       
              properties such as friction and wear.
