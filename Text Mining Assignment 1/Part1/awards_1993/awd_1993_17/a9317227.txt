              Title: Milankovitch Forcing of Continental Monsoons Across the  Equator of
              Pangaea    This award is directed at an examination of Milankovitch forcing of 
              climate in the equatorial zone of Late Triassic and earliest  Jurassic Pangaea.
               The recording medium consists of lacustrine  rocks laid down in Early Mesozoic
              rift valleys preserved in eastern  North America that can now be shown to cover
              a latitudinal range  from 6.5o straddling the paleoequator.  These lacustrine
              rocks  consist of lake level cycles that recorded Milankovitch forcing of 
              monsoonal precipitation over the interval from about 230 to 199 Ma.   This work
              will extend the high-resolution cyclostratigraphy,  magnetostratigraphy, and
              paleolatitudinal framework developed in  the Newark basin coring project
              backward in time and laterally in  geography through the study available cores
              and outcrop in six  additional rift basins.  This will result in a
              time-geography-  climate matrix which will address three specific problems: 1) 
              regional trends in the climate of equatorial Pangaea as it drifted  northward
              about 10o; 2) the doubling of the frequency of precession  cycle forcing around
              the equator; and 3) the apparent broadening of  the humid belts in the latest
              Triassic-Early Jurassic.  The first  and last of these are important for
              refining tests of global  climate models of Pangaea.  The second is of generic
              interest,  reflecting general processes of Milankovitch forcing expected in 
              tropical regions of any age but most readily addressed by study of  these
              unique sequences.
