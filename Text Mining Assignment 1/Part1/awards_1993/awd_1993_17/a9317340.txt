 This proposal is submitted under a special pilot program,
              Undergraduate Mentorships in Environmental Biology.  The four year program will
              offer undergraduate students first hand experience in carrying out ecological
              research under the mentorships of six active research ecologists.  We will
              aggressively seek to involve groups traditionally under represented in
              environmental biology, includi ng trainees of Latino, American Indian, and
              African American backgrounds as well as a number of non minority students. 
              This effort will be aided considerably by close coordination with existing
              programs that target these minority groups at ASU.  The program is a
              specialized educational track consisting of an integrative first year seminar,
              early exposure to advanced courses, research involvement at the outset of
              students' college careers, and continued follow up and support of individual
              students as they make plans for graduate school and future careers.  Careful
              documentation of the program's successes and failures, support from other
              research experience programs targeting more advanced undergraduate students,
              and placement of students in individual laboratories will facilitate the entry
              of alumni and alumnae of this program into research careers in environmental
              biology.
