Abstract    :
              9317463  Judd       The main effort is directed to developing a quark model of 
              the atom.  The quarks each correspond to an elementary  irreducible
              representation of a Lie group and their study leads  to an enhanced
              understanding of the occurrence of many zero  matrix elements in the f-shells
              of atoms.  Additional research  continues on the group theory and two-photon
              transitions in rare-  earth ions in crystals.  ***
