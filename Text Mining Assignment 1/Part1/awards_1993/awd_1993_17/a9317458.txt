Abstract    :
              9317458  Berg  This award supports a petrological, geochemical, and 
              geochronological study of volcanics from the Balleny Islands, one  of two
              localities of ocean island basaltic volcanism on the  Antarctic plate. 
              Petrographic analyses of thin sections will  determine modal minerals, which
              will yield information about  depth of magma origin, and will aid in
              determining the extent of  alteration.  Analytical work will include major and
              trace element  analyses, isotopic analyses for the Pb, Sr, and Nd systems, as 
              well as K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar geochronological data.  These data will  be used,
              along with other ocean island basalt data, to constrain  the composition of
              mantle chemical reservoirs during the time of  production of the magmas.  When
              added to other databases, these  data will contribute to a better understanding
              of the geographic  extent of mantle reservoirs and the correlation of these 
              reservoirs in the southern hemisphere.  ***
