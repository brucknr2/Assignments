Abstract    :
              9317434  Farmer  This award will provide the PI with support to participate  in
              development (with scientists at Los Alamos National  Laboratory) of high ion
              yield ion sources for solid state  mass spectrometers.   The primary focus of
              the project  involves design, testing and attachment of a miniature  version of
              a hot cavity source to an isotope ratio thermal  ionization mass spectrometer. 
              A second aspect of the  proposed work will elucidate ways of increasing element
              ion  yields by studying the nature of ionization of dopants in Si-  glass
              matrices.
