Abstract    :
                9317338  Vittoria    Technical abstract:  Standard lithographic techniques
              will be used  to construct a planar microwave device which will be capable of 
              measuring microwave resonance signals over a probe area of 0.1 x  0.1 micron2
              of a magnetic thin film.  Current operational devices  probe areas of 100 x 100
              micron2.  Measurements of the microwave  resonance spectra as a function of
              probe size will be performed on  standard metal films.  It is expected that
              these devices will be  useful for the study of magnetic thin films and
              multilayers, fine  powders, and single magnetic domains.      Non-technical
              abstract:  Many interesting magnetic phenomena occur  on a very small (less
              than 1/1000 of a millimeter) scale.  These  are often related to structurally
              small objects such as fine  powders but also include microscopic magnetic
              phenomena.  Standard  magnetic characterization techniques can determine only
              an average  property.  It is proposed to build and test a device which will be 
              capable of performing magnetic measurements on a scale of 1/1000mm.  The device
              will be useful for studying a variety of thin films as  well as magnetic
              powders.  ***
