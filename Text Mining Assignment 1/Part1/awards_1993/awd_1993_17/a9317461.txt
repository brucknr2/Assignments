Abstract    :
              9317461  Durham  The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program is giving 
              increasing attention to the earthquake threat in the Central  U.S.  This award
              will support a two-day symposium that will  focus on earthquake-related
              research that addresses  socioeconomic and public policy issues in the Central
              U.S.,  including the need for new research thrusts.  The objectives  of the
              symposium are to summarize relevant research that  addresses earthquake hazard
              reduction in the Central U.S.,  produce recommendations for improving the
              application of  research on earthquake hazard reduction, and to facilitate 
              closer collaboration between researchers and practitioners  in the Central U.S.
