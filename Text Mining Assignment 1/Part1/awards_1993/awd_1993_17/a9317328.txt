Abstract    :
              9317328  Fletcher         An acceptable relative sea-level (RSL) history for the
              post-   glacial period in Hawaii has not yet been proposed.  Late Holocene  
              RSL is characterized by gradually decreasing hydroisostatic uplift.    New
              field evidence showing emergence documents the hydroisostatic   deformation of
              Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and probably Maui following   the culmination of
              post-glacial RSL rise.  The timing of initial   emergence, its height, and it
              termination all appear to have an   island-specific character reflecting the
              influence of island   radius, distance from the volcanic center, and various
              site-   specific factors.  Research will focus on obtaining additional   field
              data to constrain these variables and produce a model of  hydroisostatic
              response along the Hawaii Ridge.         Pleistocene and early Holocene RSL
              around Oahu and Kauai  will  be documented with cores from submerged
              shorelines.  Wave-cut   notches and drowned reef complexes indicate former
              sea-level   positions at predictable depths encircling both islands.  A small, 
               hand-held pneumatic drill can sample early deposited carbonate   dating former
              RSL.  Petrographic and XRD analysis of samples will   help define geologic
              history.  Species-specific oxygen isotope   contents will be determined from
              well preserved, dated coral   samples.  Variations in the oceanic oxygen
              isotope chemistry during   the post-glacial transgression will be documented. 
              The research   will produce a detailed RSL history for Kauai and Oahu tied to  
              changes in the stable isotope record of meltwater history.
