Abstract    :
              9317453  SHAH  Description:  Scientists from five U.S. universities will 
              participate with Pakistani scientists in a workshop that will  promote computer
              vision research there.  This will be the first  workshop of its kind held in
              Pakistan and follows as a logical  next step in continuing the dialogue between
              Pakistani and U.S.  scientists working in this field.  Many of the Pakistani 
              scientists did there graduate studies in the U.S.  With INT  support, Professor
              Shah gave a short course on Computer Vision at  Mehran University of
              Engineering in 1992 and made the necessary  contacts to start a linkage program
              between the University of  Central Florida and the University of Sindh.  Shah
              is responsible  for building up computer vision research in his department and 
              leads a computer vision research group consisting of doctoral and   masters
              candidates and undergraduates.   Shah is a recipient of  major NSF funding to
              build such research capability in the U.S.   One of his students who did
              outstanding research was invited to  make a presentation on his REU project at
              NSF in 1990.    Scope:  Computer vision research has important application in 
              High Performance Computing and Communications, and in industrial  automation
              and robotics.  Factories of the future are expected to  be heavily automated. 
              The participants will evaluate the current  state-of-the-art in this area and
              suggest directions for the  future.  Particular attention will be given to
              identification of  the University-industry interaction and for the Pakistanis
              U.S.  perspectives on curriculum development.  ***
