                           9317435 Travis  Minority students are grossly underrepresented
              among those students who commit themselves to careers as research scientists.
              This deficiency is even more marked in environmental biology than in many other
              fields, resulting in a severe underrepresentation of minority scientists in
              environmental biology.  We propose a program to recruit promising minority
              undergraduates and guide them into Ph.D. programs in environmental biology. 
              The program will recruit three cohorts of students and guide them through a two
              year plan of customized course work and research apprenticeship.  We will work
              together with the NSF funded Florida Georgia Alliance for Minority Progress
              Program at Florida A&M University to offer opportunities t o a broader group of
              talented, science oriented minority students than exists at Florida State
              University alone.  The program will take advantage of existing programs at the
              two schools that will help us overcome the problems of preparation and social
              adjustment that hinder many talented minority students who seek to participate
              in a scientific setting.  This program, with its variety of intensive personal
              interactions between research faculty and students, and among the students
              themselves, will provide the personal mentorship that is critical to guide
              undergraduate students into research careers.  We will evaluate and assess the
              success of the program by following the post graduate trajectories of our
              students and comparing them with a series of cohorts matched for background and
              prior achievement who have not participated in the program.
