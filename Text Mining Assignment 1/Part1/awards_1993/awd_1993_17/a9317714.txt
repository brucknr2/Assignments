Abstract    :
              9317714  Anderson       This project extends IP networking to 107 cooperative 
              extension offices throughout Iowa.  The state is providing local  area networks
              and computer equipment at the extension offices.   This award covers the
              networking equipment, line installation and  leasing, and technical and user
              support for the sites.  The network  uses the Novell extended LAN concept,
              which makes the entire state  cooperative extension service network appear to
              the user as a LAN.  The award provides partial support for three years.  ***
