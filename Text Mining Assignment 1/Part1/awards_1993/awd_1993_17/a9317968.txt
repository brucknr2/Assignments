Abstract    :
              9317968  Correll  This study explores the effects of  geology, land use
              distribution, and weather on discharges of water, sediment, nitrogen,
              phosphorus, and silicate from watersheds throughout the Chesapeake Bay.  Past
              measurements of discharges from 29 watersheds in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont
              provinces have revealed dramatic differences relating to both geology and land
              use.  The proposed work will expand the study to include watersheds in the
              Ridge and Valley and Appalachian Plateau regions of the Chesapeake watershed,
              and will increase the numbers and types of watersheds compared.  %%%  Relating
              landscape structure to nutrient discharges is a primary objective. 
              Computerized geographic information systems are used to quantify geographic
              patterns, identify indices of landscape structure that relate to nutrient
              discharge, and develop models to predict discharges.  These efforts will be
              expanded to cover a broader geographical scale.  Results from data at different
              levels of spatial resolution will be compared to explore how knowledge from
              small-scale, fine-grain studies extrapolates to large-scale. coarse-grain
              analyses.  %%%  These watershed studies and geographic analyses will provide
              basic knowledge on landscape function and the factors controlling nutrient
              fluxes.  The study will develop methods for linking nutrient discharge
              measurements, GIS, and landscape models to extrapolate predictions of nutrient
              flux to regional scales.  This will provide essential knowledge for predicting
              nutrient discharges to Chesapeake Bay.
