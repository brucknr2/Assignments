Abstract    :
              9317546  Spudich       Funds are requested to help support a Gordon Conference 
              on Sensory transduction in Microorganisms. The conference,  which is
              anticipated to have  110-130 attendees will permit  scientists from the US and
              abroad to discuss recent  developments and new ideas regarding molecular
              mechanisms of  sensory modulation of simple unicellular systems.  Sessions will
              emphasize the  emerging generalizations  regarding  the nature of chemo- and
              photosensory receptors,  transduction of the signals, the intracellular
              signaling  processes and cell responses to these.  The responses may  range
              from flagellar to pseudopod modulation in tactic cells  to gene expression in
              both prokaryotic and eukaryotic  organisms.  Discussions will emphasize
              apparent homologies  between microbial and higher animal signal transduction 
              processes.  %%%  The Conference, especially when it includes graduate student 
              participation, will provide a platform for the discussion of  the emerging
              general understanding of the molecular  mechanism of sensory modulation of
              simple unicellular  systems.  Such a platform for discussion is necessary for 
              the advancement of the sensory transduction field both at  the national and
              international level.  ***
