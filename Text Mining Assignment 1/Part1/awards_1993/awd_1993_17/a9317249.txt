Abstract    :
              9317249  O'Neill    Flowering involves the developmental transition of the shoot
              meristem from vegetative to reproductive growth.  In many species of flowering
              plants, this developmental transition is regulated by photoperiod.  The
              principal site of photoperiodic perception is the leaf, where inductive
              processes are proposed to lead to the synthesis of a floral stimulus that is
              translocated to target cells of the apical meristem where floral evocation is
              triggered.  This process therefore involves interorgan signaling mediated by a
              translocatable chemical messenger of darkness.  The biochemical and molecular
              basis of photoperiodic perception and signal transduction to the apex, however,
              remains a major unsolved problem in plant development.  Recently, Dr. O'Neill
              has identified N-acetyl 5-methoxytryptamine, or melatonin, in several
              photoperiodic plant species and has determined that the concentration of this
              methoxylated indoleamine in the photoreceptive tissue of Pharbitis nil is
              correlated with dark induction of flowering.  Melatonin is a well-known hormone
              involved in the regulation of seasonal reproduction in many diverse eukaryotic
              taxa including vertebrates, insects, and algae where it functions as a chemical
              messenger of "darkness".  The detection of melatonin in plants, and the
              rhythmic cycling of its concentration, suggest the possibility that melatonin
              may also be an important biochemical component of photoperiodic signal
              transduction in plants.  In related research, Dr. O'Neill has also
              characterized a set of mRNAs whose abundance cycles in parallel with
              photoperiodic floral induction.  These results suggest  that photoperiodic
              responses in the leaf may be mediated by activation of gene expression.  ***
