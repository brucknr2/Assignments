Abstract    :
              9317531  Engebretson         Since the advent of plate tectonics, earth
              scientists have  increasingly emphasized the importance of the lateral growth
              of  continental crust by the processes of terrane accretion and  magmatic arc
              development.  The Cordilleran orogen of North America  is one of the prime
              examples of such crustal growth, and the  Alaskan portion of this belt is
              considered to have been constructed  almost entirely by the process of terrane
              accretion.           This study will undertake an ambitious geological and 
              geophysical transect across the northernmost portion of the  Cordilleran orogen
              in the Bering-Chukchi region of the Arctic,  between mainland Alaska and
              Russia.  The main goals of the research  are to provide us with greater insight
              into the details of the  creation, evolution and modification of the crust
              beneath  Cordilleran-style oroginic belts, to give us a better understanding 
              of the coupling between tectonic and petrologic processes at deep  and shallow
              crustal levels, and to help us determine the general  links between processes
              at the scale of the crust and those at the  plate tectonic scale.          The
              project is a collaborative effort by researchers at  Stanford (Miller and
              Klemperer), Rice (Wright), UC Santa Barbara  (Gans), and Western Washington
              (Engebretson).  The project also  involves scientists from the USGS Branches of
              Pacific Marine  Geology (Scholl, Childs), of Alaskan Geology (Grantz, Moore),
              and  of Seismology (Brocher), and three well-known Russian scientists  from
              Khabarovsk (B. Natal'in), Yakutsk (L. Parfenov) and Magadan  (M. Gelman).  ***
