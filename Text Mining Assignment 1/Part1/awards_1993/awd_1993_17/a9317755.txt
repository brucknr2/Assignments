Abstract    :
              9317755  Green    In the normal development of flowers and vegetative shoots  of
              plants, there is a highly coordinated pattern of gene  expression and
              morphological change.  Dr. Green will study  both processes and their mode of
              interaction.  Expression  gradients are postulated to set up physical expansion
               gradients which lead to the spontaneous complex folding of  tissue.  This is a
              new proposal for the origin of  periodicity and pattern.  The morphological
              change is  postulated to act back on expression via stretch receptors  or
              cytoskeletal responses.  This completes a generative  cycle for morphogenesis. 
              Organ pattern on the sunflower  head emerges in strict developmental sequence
              behind a  circular generative zone which moves from the rim into a  central
              field of undifferentiated cells.  The major aim is  to determine the relative
              sequence of expression events and  of folding events in this meristem.  Pattern
              and tissue  folding are to be followed in detail by a non-destructive  SEM
              replica method.  Expression is to be studied by in situ  hybridization. 
              Similar analysis is proposed for other  systems, including morphological
              mutants.  Dr. Green will  study changes brought on by non-invasive physical 
              perturbation.  The nature of the cyclic interaction of  expression and
              morphological response should become clear.  ***
