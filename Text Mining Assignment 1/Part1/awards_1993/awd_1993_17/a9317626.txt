Abstract    :
              9317626  Yodh  Description:  The International Conference on Non-Accelerator 
              Particle Physics will convene in Bangalore, India from January 2-  9, 1994. 
              Gaurang B. Yodh, University of California, Irvine and  R. Cowsik, Tata
              Institute of Fundamental Research and Director,  Indian Institute of
              Astrophysics (IIA), Bangalore are the  organizers.  This conference is unique
              in its interdisciplinary  approach to discussing the close interconnections
              among  apparently diverse areas of study.  It is dedicated to the  discussion
              of the fundamental physics that emerges from diverse  areas of non-accelerator
              particle physics such as: Solar Neutrino  Astronomy, Cosmic Rays, Particle
              Physics, Neutrino Physics and  the Detection of Dark Matter.  Substantial
              progress has been made  in these fields during the past five years and it is
              widely  thought that definitive answers to several questions in Physics  beyond
              the Standard Model can now come from Non-Accelerator  methods of inquiry.  The
              conferees will review recent  developments in various areas of Particle
              Physics, their  implications in astrophysical situations, the experimental 
              detection of dark matter, theoretical interpretation and  empirical/physical
              models of the large scale structure of the  Universe.     Scope:  This
              conference will precede the start of a major  institutional collaboration among
              several members of the  Universities of California and the Indian Institute of 
              Astrophysics, Bangalore in areas of research discussed at the  conference. 
              Therefore, the conference will be an important  initiating activity for the
              interdisciplinary research program   and for launching the IIA into modern
              areas of study.  Since  considerable research is going on in the US in all
              fields to be  discussed, this will be an opportunity for the US researchers to 
              present their work to some of the most distinguished scientists  from all over
              the world.  The proceedings will be published.  ***
