Abstract    :
              9317722  Smith  Advances in the area of automatic  control, artificial
              intelligence,  smart materials, sensors, and  actuators have made the
              development  of intelligent structures feasible.   Such structures would have
              the  ability to identify their dynamical  state, including parameter 
              variations; identify functional  descriptions of external stimuli,  e.g.
              earthquake loads, high winds,  traffic; and adaptively generate the  required
              actuation forces in the  presence of major stimuli.  In order  to develop such
              an intelligent  structure several research issues  have to be studied.  This 
              investigation focuses on the   formulation and development of a  neural-based
              control scheme, with  emphasis on learning of structural  parameter variations,
              and design and  construction of a new low-powered  adaptive actuation system
              for  structures.  The resulting  intelligent structural control  system will
              have a fuzzy based  uncertainty compensator.    The overall research objective
              is to  evaluate and compare performances of  intelligent and conventional
              control  systems.  A  prototype structure,  namely a small scaled cable bridge 
              will be constructed for experimental  purposes.  The proposed actuators  and
              control systems will be  integrated and implemented on this  experimental
              structure, and the  effects of soil - structure  interaction will be emulated
              and  considered.  ***
