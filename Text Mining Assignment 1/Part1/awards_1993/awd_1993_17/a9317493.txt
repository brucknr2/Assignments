Abstract    :
              A Symposium is to be held at the University of Tennessee,  Knoxville, on the
              subject of Radiative Corrections to the  Standard Model.  Attendance will be
              drawn from the worldwide  community of expert experimental and theoretical
              practitioners as  well as graduate students and postdoctoral associates.  The 
              Symposium will be 4-1/2 days in duration, with a format of half-  hour long
              invited talks.  Topics to be covered include those of  near-term interest,
              physics at the Z  for example, and future  concerns to be addressed at LHC
              (formerly at SSC).  Attendance is  planned for about 150 participants, by
              invitation only.
