Abstract    :
              9317329  Goldberg      This award will support the travel of Dr. Fred Goldberg
              from the  Department of Physics at San Diego State University to conduct 
              cooperative research, over a two year period, on student learning  of physics
              with Dr. Richard Gunstone, Director of the Center for  Science, Mathematics and
              Technology Education at Monash  University in Melbourne.     The project has
              three objectives that address needs established  by the physics education
              community: to develop instruments and  methodologies to explore students'
              beliefs about the structure  and content of physics knowledge, and about
              teaching and  learning; to develop tasks that would elicit students' prior 
              ideas; and to develop strategies suitable for ongoing  assessment of student
              understanding.  When met, these objectives  will be utilized to develop a new
              infrastructure for promoting  meaningful learning of physics in college level
              introductory  courses.
