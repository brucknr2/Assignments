Abstract    :
              9317307  Fisk   This award supports a study of rocks from submarine volcanos and
               hydrothermal vents in the Bransfield Straits region of the  Antarctic
              Peninsula.  This is a continental margin rift in which  volcanoes less than 1
              million years old have formed on thinned  continental crust from melting in the
              upper mantle.  Prior to 4  million years ago, this region was undergoing active
              subduction  of oceanic crust.  Seismic studies of recent earthquakes in the 
              Bransfield Strait indicate the presence of an ancient slab of  oceanic crust
              approximately 55 to 85 kilometers beneath the  surface.  As a cold, wet, slab
              sinks into the mantle, it heats  up, dehydrates, and expels fluid into the
              surrounding mantle.   This fluid induces melting and the melts move upward;
              some magma  is erupted at the surface.  By examining the volcanic rocks in  the
              Bransfield Strait, the investigators will learn about  magmatic processes in
              the mantle and about processes related to  recycling of oceanic crust into the
              mantle that occurred in the  past, during active subduction.  An ancillary
              aspect of this  study relates to hydrothermal activity near the volcanoes.  
              Hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks will be analyzed in order  to determine
              the chemical changes that hydrothermal alteration  has caused.  This study
              utilizes rocks that have already been  collected and visually characterized.
