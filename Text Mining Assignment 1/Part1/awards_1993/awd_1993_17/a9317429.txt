Abstract    :
              9317429  Garrison  This project is in the area of surface science and focusses
              on the  development of a firm theoretical understanding of chemical  reactions
              at surfaces induced by energetic particle bombardment.   During the tenure of
              this three-year continuing grant, Professor  Garrison and her students will
              model keV particle bombardment of  small organic molecules adsorbed on metal
              surfaces which are of  catalytic interest, surface induced dissociation
              processes in which  a 30-200 eV organic molecule strikes a surface, and finally
              the keV  particle bombardment of thin films including self assembled 
              monolayers and polymers.  The emphasis will be on examining  reactions that
              occur during each of these events and then relating  the fundamental processes
              to experimental observations.  %%%  This research brings modern surface theory
              and computational  chemistry to bear on understanding of how particle
              bombardment  causes chemical reactions at surfaces.  Models derived in the 
              course of this work will be important to progress in the study of  complex
              materials as diverse as catalysts, organic thin films, and  biological cells.
