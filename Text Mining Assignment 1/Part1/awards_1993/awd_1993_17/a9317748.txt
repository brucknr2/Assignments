Abstract    :
              9317748  Schuller    Technical abstract:  This proposal relates to the growth, 
              characterization, and modeling of the physical properties of strongly 
              correlated electron systems of varying dimensionality.  The systems to  be
              studied are mostly prepared using state-of-the-art thin film  deposition and 
              electron beam and scanning tunneling lithography  techniques.  The condensed
              matter problems studied include dimensional  transitions from zero to one, one
              to two, and two to three dimensions  in superconductivity and magnetism.  A
              crucial and essential  ingredient proposed here is the structural and chemical 
              characterization of the artificial structures used in these studies.  The
              materials will be grown using sputtering and molecular beam  epitaxi.  The
              growth techniques will be correlated with in situ and ex  situ structural
              characterization techniques combined with simulation  and refinement methods
              developed in the principal investigator's  laboratory.    Non-technical
              abstract:  The study of novel materials in restricted  geometries provides the
              basic research basis and is directly related  to applications in the field of
              microelectronics, including the  development of novel sensors, devices and
              recording media.   The  condensed matter problems studied include dimensional
              transitions from  zero to one to two and three dimensions in superconductivity
              and  magnetism.  A crucial and essential ingredient proposed here is the 
              structural and chemical characterization of the artificial structures  used in
              these studies.  The materials will be grown using a variety of  growth
              techniques.  The growth techniques will be correlated with  structural
              characterization techniques developed in the principal  investigator's
              laboratory.  ***
