              9317297 Wang As a part of the US China (PRC) Protocol on Cooperative Earthquake
              studies, Annex 111 Program, this project supports a U.S./PRC/Japan Trilateral
              Symposium/Workshop on Innovative Lifeline Earthquake Engineering.  The meeting
              is scheduled to be held in May, 1994 in Xian, PRC.  The objective of the
              symposium is to facilitate the cooperative research on innovative lifeline
              protection measures against earthquake hazards between researchers in ORC,
              Japan and the United States to review progress to date with each countries and
              to form future research directions and to identify opportunities for further
              collaboration.  During the protocol coordination meeting in March 1993 in
              Washington, DC, this proposed trilateral Symposium/Workshop has been included
              as a high priority cooperative activity to be implemented in 1994 by both
              countries.  Proceedings of the symposium will be published and widely
              distributed in the research community of lifeline earthquake engineering. ***
