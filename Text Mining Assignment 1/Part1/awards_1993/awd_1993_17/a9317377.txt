Abstract    :
              9317377  Draayer        The objectives of the proposed research is to  achieve a
              microscopic understanding of the origin of  good pseudo-spin symmetry in heavy
              deformed nuclei.  This special symmetry is manifest in the occurrence of 
              pseudo spin-orbit doublets in heavy (rare earth and  actinide) deformed odd-A
              nuclei with measured magnetic  moments that lie close to the asymptotic
              pseudo-Nilsson  values.  The existence of good pseudo-spin symmetry  means
              there is hope for being able to carry out  detailed shell-model calculations
              for heavy deformed  nuclei within the pseudo-LS and pseudo-SU (3) pictures, 
              following  J.P. Elliott's lead in the application of  this symmetry for  light
              deformed nuclei.  ***
