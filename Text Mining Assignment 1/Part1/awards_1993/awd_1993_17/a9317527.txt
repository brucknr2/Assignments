Abstract    :
              9317527  Lindstedt    The experiments outlined in this proposal are to look at
              the  mechanisms of maintaining muscle energy balance and  sustained 
              performance. Muscle  contraction is dependent upon energy  supply  which in
              turn is dependent upon a number of metabolic and  physiological processes. In
              this proposal the investigators  will  use magnetic resonance spectroscopy to
              determine the  contractile  demand and oxidative potential of the rattlesnake
              tail-  shaker  muscle during continuous contractions. The tail shaker  muscles
              are  sustaining high frequencing for over 30 minutes continuously  and  thus
              have high oxidative capacity to supply ATP for these  contractions. The
              investigators will use a range of body  temperature from 5 - 35 o C for
              rattling to look for demand  under  maximal conditions. In vivo muscle
              energetics will be  determined  using a test which involves 31P magnetic
              resonance  spectroscopy  to measure ATP breakdown and recovery changes in 
              phosphocreatine  content  during muscle  activation. The hypothesis is that 
              energy  flux during rattling changes as a simple temperature effect  on  the
              underlying rates of demand supply. This a model system  for  non-invasive
              evaluation of rate processes and the  coordination of  metabolism in vivo.  ***
