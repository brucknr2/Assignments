Abstract    :
                            9317438  HOLLISTER  This  conference on radioactivity and
              environmental  security  in  the  Arctic and North Atlantic oceans brought
              together scientists  from  nine countries. This goal was to share data and to
              initiate  collaborative  efforts concerning research on  the  environmental 
              impacts  of  radioactive dumping activities.  Russian  scientists  attended,   
              leading   to   the   production   of   a   scholarly  policy/economic review of
              the impact of Soviet nuclear dumping.  ***
