Abstract    :
              9317506  Miller    Dr. Miller will participate in the management and data
              analysis of  the GLOBEC Georges Ban Broad Scale Survey.  This will include  
              (1) work on the formation and management of the Georges Bank  Plankton
              Technical Group (GBPTG) at Woods Hole, and (2) studies of  the population
              biology of Calanus finmarchicus, Pseudocalanus  moultoni, and Pseudocalanus
              newmani using the very large sample set  to be collected by the Broad Scale
              Survey.  In specific studies of  copepods he will use the broad scale survey
              preserved sample set,  plus specially preserved samples and subsamples, to
              examine aspects  of C. finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp. life history,
              growth, and  production biology as functions of season, temperature and 
              stratification, location over or off the bank, food availability,  and
              hydrography.  Goals will include comprehensive estimation of  secondary
              production by C. finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp. to  allow comparisons
              among seasons, years, and sites across Georges  Bank.
