Abstract    :
              9317986  MacIntyre     This research investigates the vertical circulation of
              phytoplankton by turbulent motions over diurnal cycles and how this circulation
              affects photosynthetic rates.  It also investigates the relative importance of
              nutrient supply to the euphytic zone via diapycnal mixing and horizontal
              exchanges.  The project comprises time-series measurements of vertical mixing
              and horizontal exchange coupled with estimates of photosynthetic rates and
              profiles of nutrient concentrations taken over the same periods.  %%%  This
              study will provide the first systematic analysis of vertical mixing in which
              turbulence dynamics are directly measured and related to the light environment
              of phytoplankton.  These data, coupled with information to be gathered on the
              dynamics of nutrient movement, will permit proper analysis of resource-based
              models of primary productivity, nutrient competition, and phytoplankton
              succession.  The results of this research will have applications in analysis of
              ecosystem function and health and aquatic pollution monitoring.    ***
