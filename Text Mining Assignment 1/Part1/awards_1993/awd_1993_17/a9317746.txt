Abstract    :
              9317746  Howes    This project funds the University of Connecticut's 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Grinding  Research.  This
              funding is being provided by the Advanced Research  Projects Agency (ARPA) to
              support a research activity to design,  build, and test a prototype high-speed
              Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN)  grinding machine for the rolling element bearing
              industry.    This project will establish a teaming arrangement with a bearing 
              manufacturing company, a machine tool builder, and Center's  researchers to
              conduct the following tasks:  1) modelling of the  high-speed CBN grinding
              process; 2) development of high-speed wheel  and dressing capability; 3)
              development of sensors and adaptive  control techniques; and 4) design, build,
              and test the new  developed CBN grinding machine.    This research project
              builds on the research results in CBN  grinding technology which the Center
              developed in the past three  years.  The P.I. and his colleagues have
              demonstrated competency in  their research performance in this area and have
              the knowledge and  facilities to conduct this research project.    The Program
              Manager recommends the University of Connecticut be  awarded $3,325,000 for
              three years with funds provided by the ARPA.
