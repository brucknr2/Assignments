Abstract    :
               9317917  Gorenstein  Support is requested for purchase of a 600 MHz NMR console
               as an upgrade to our Varian  VXR 600 NMR spectrometer. Sparcl0 upgrades of
              computers for  a Varian VXR 500 MHz spectrometer and off-line workstation  are
              also requested. These spectrometer upgrades will enhance  the NMR capabilities
              on campus, including the existing  Purdue University Biochemical Magnetic
              Resonance Laboratory  (PUBMRL) and an NSF Biological Facilities Center in 
              Biomolecular NMR, Structure and Design. These Centers and  the high field
              spectrometers in the Chemistry Department  have sought to provide
              state-of-the-art high resolution NMR,  computer graphics/molecular modeling,
              and molecular dynamics  calculation methodologies to determine the 3D solution 
              structure and dynamics of biomolecules. Pulsed field  gradient and triple
              resonance, 3D and 4D NMR will be made  possible by the upgrade. The upgraded
              console and computers  will allow the solution structural determination of much
               larger proteins, protein drug complexes, and modified  oligonucleotide analogs
              (antisense and ribozymes) than are  currently feasible on campus. In a number
              of collaborative  and major user projects, these biomolecules will be 
              synthesized using established synthetic organic methods or  through automated
              DNA or oligopeptide synthesizers.  Alternatively, recombinant DNA methodologies
              will be used to  overproduce wild-type and mutant proteins. The various NMR 
              Centers on campus will provide the infrastructure support to  determine the 3D
              structure of the biomolecules via  multidimensional NMR methods.  Structure and
              activity of the  designed biomolecules will be compared to understand better 
              the structural basis for biological function of these  molecules.
