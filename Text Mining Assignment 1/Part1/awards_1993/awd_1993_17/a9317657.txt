Abstract    :
              9317657  Sogin   This proposal seeks to  offer interdisciplinary training and
              promote collaborative efforts between molecular biologists, organismal
              biologists and theoreticians.  Prominent scientists in molecular biology,
              ecology, population biology, organismal biology and biometrics will offer a
              high powered lecture series.  Topics to be covered include but are not limited
              to the theory of phylogenetic (genealogical) reconstruction, macromolecular
              alignment techniques, current trends in molecular phylogenetics, molecular
              approaches to studies of population biology and biodiversity, comparative
              molecular biology, and comparative analysis of genome data bases.  The lectures
              will be augmented by a computer laboratory.  Students will have the opportunity
              to use state-of-the-art facilites to test theoretical concepts described in the
              lecture series.  Guided by authors of phylogenetic analytic software programs
              and designers of data base retrieval software from the National Laboratory of
              Medicine, the students will have the opportunity to compare different
              analytical techniques for molecular data.  The computer laboratory will be
              equipped with diverse computer platforms and will offer each student the
              opportunity to work in an environment that is relevant to hardware
              configurations available at their home institution.  The opportunity to
              implement concepts described in the lecture series using diverse up-to-date
              computer hardware is a distinguishing feature of this course.  The course is
              designed for established investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate
              students from diverse biological fields.
