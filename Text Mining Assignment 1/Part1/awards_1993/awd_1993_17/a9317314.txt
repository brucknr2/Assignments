Abstract    :
              9317314  Sahagian  We propose to develop an analytical formulation and 
              numerical model directed toward gaining a quantitative  understanding of the
              relationship between bubble growth and  volcanic eruptions.  As a result of the
              proposed project, we  hope to quantify the processes which control bubble
              growth  in ascending magma during eruption and how the various  magmatic
              properties, parameters, and environmental  conditions affect the style of
              volcanic eruptions.  Our  proposed study can be divided into two basic
              objectives  including 1) quantification of the factors contributing to  bubble
              growth in an ascending magma (parametric study); and  2) quantification of the
              effect of bubble growth on magma  ascent during eruption.  The first objective
              involves  numerical modeling of individual bubbles (small scale) and  their
              interaction with the surrounding melt.  The second  objective is to account for
              the feedback between magma rise  (and decompression) and bubble growth
              throughout the magma  column.  This will allow the quantification of dissolved
              and  exsolved volatile fractions at the point of melt  fragmentation into
              spray.  The proposed project will extend  our analysis far beyond the
              preliminary work, and should be  more applicable to natural systems.
