Abstract    :
              9317348  Bain       PI will map, document, and collect unusual lacustrine 
              stromatolites of Pennsylvanian age from a soon-to-be-reclaimed coal  mine in
              Ohio.  Petrologic, x-ray, microprobe and isotope analyses  will also provide
              information about these Pennsylvanian-age non-  marine water bodies and the
              growth of stromatolites in general.   Collected  information can be compared to
              other ancient and modern  stromatolites, in particular in the Bahamas (San
              Salvador) lakes,  where PI has conducted research.
