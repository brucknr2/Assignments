Abstract    :
                9317648  Chrispeels  The Department of Biology of the University of
              California, San Diego, has made a commitment to establish a research focus in
              plant molecular biology. New positions have been allocated, space has been made
              available in a modern building, generous start up funds have been given, and a
              plant biology field station has been built. Several collaborations between the
              new faculty members have already emerged, and the group will focus its research
              activities along two major lines: (1) membrane proteins and signal
              transduction, and (2) regulation of gene activity. The group consists of one
              senior faculty (Maarten J. Chrispeels), and four recently appointed faculty
              (Robert J. Schmidt, Nigel Crawford, Martin Yanofsky and Julian Schroeder).
              Although excellent functional laboratories are available for the faculty,
              several major pieces of equipment are required because our research groups have
              expanded very fast and because several pieces of shared equipment are now too
              old or too heavily used to satisfy our needs. The shared equipment we wish to
              purchase will promote the interactions between the laboratories and facilitate
              the training of graduate students and postdocs, besides having a vital role in
              research projects discussed in this proposal. The items of equipment include a
              patch clamp workstation, a luminometer and an ultracentrifuge.   u    ~     @
