Abstract    :
              9317096  Johnson    This project will examine and reprocess recently acquired
              seismic  profile data, released from Industrial sources, for the northern 
              Coast Ranges section of northern California.  The data will be used  to test
              two currently prevailing models - one involving Late  Cretaceous to Paleocene
              extensional unroofing of the Franciscan  blueschist complex, and the other
              involving unroofing of the  complex  in a compressional stress field - by
              providing a link  between surface structural geometry and that at depth.  The
              results  will have wide applicability to forearc regions of other major 
              orogenic regions.  ***
