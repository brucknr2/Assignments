Abstract    :
                                              IBN- 9317923  Neuringer                         
                Abstract                                  The ability to vary behavior when
              the environment changes  can be crucial.  Behavioral variability is also an
              important  component of problem-solving, creativity, and possibly even  mental
              health.  Dr. Neuringer's research is directed at  providing basic information
              about how variable and novel  behaviors are generated and influenced.  Dr.
              Neuringer has  developed a system to study the effects of positive 
              reinforcement on behavioral variability.  He will examine  basic theoretical
              questions as well as the effects of  incentives, drugs, and aging on the
              ability to generate  variable behavior.  He will investigate what contributes
              to  an individual preferring to vary its behaviors as opposed to  repeating a
              single act.  He also will study the  contributions of reinforced variations to
              the learning of  new responses, cognitive strategies and categories.  Dr. 
              Neuringer's research will make significant contributions  towards our
              theoretical and practical knowledge of this  relatively unstudied but important
              dimension of behavior.
