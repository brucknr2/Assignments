                       9317803 Tollerton This proposal request that NSF support the efforts
              of the American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES) to promote and
              advance sustainable development in the U.S. engineering community through the
              AAES Task Force on Sustainable Development and, internatinally, through the
              World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO), the Pan American
              Federation of Engineering Societies (UPADI), and the World Engineering
              Partnership for Sustainable Development (WEPSD).  The proposer, in
              collaboration with WEPSD, will compile papers on sustainable development, as
              well as policy papers elaborating on each of the sustainable development action
              principles for the engineering profession, developed by the Task Group and
              approved by the AAES Board of Governors.  Other proposed activities include; a
              possible conference on sustainable development, preparation of an AAES/WEPSD
              video on sustainable development, and a speakers' bureau.
