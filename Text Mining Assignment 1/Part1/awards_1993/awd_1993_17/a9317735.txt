Abstract    :
              Peterson  9317735      Vent communities are populated largely by endemic species
               that are restricted to an ephemeral environment where  life-  sustaining vent
              fluids may persist for periods as short as  decades.  It is known that
              physiological adaptations of some  vent species play a role in dictating their
              distributions,  but the roles that recruitment, competition and 
              predation/biological  disturbance play during vent  colonization remain largely
              explored.  This study will  conduct a set of in  situ manipulative experiments 
              to  test  the roles of these processes in creating patterns of  distribution of
              vents invertebrates.  Basaltic settlement  plates will be exposed in regions
              that differ in intensity  of vent fluid flux to manipulate the intensity of 
              physiological stress and nutrient availability, and  colonization will be
              followed.  These  studies  will address  fundamental ecological processes in
              vent communities and  provide a key link between studies of larva dispersal and
               population genetics.    ***
