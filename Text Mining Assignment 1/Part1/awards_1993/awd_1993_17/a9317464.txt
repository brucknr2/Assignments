Abstract    :
              9317464  Cox    Stochastic models and methodologies for statistical inference 
              will be developed in the context of modern instrumentation-  intensive
              experimentation.  Bayesian, likelihood-based, semi- and  non-parametric methods
              will be investigated for prediction,  calibration, testing and constructing
              confidence intervals.   Efficient and numerically stable computational
              algorithms will be  developed and statistical properties will be investigated
              both  theoretically and via computer experimentation.  Much modern science
              relies on instrumentation-intensive  experimentation.  With
              instrument-generated data, the problem may  be prediction of responses for new
              inputs or untried experimental  conditions, or calibration of the responses for
              the test  settings, or understanding which components of the response bear  a
              scientific relationship to the input variables.  A variety of  processes may
              influence each observed response:  the simplest is  simple random error, other
              include deliberate or accidental  censoring, and the limitations due the
              precision of the measuring  instrument.  Proper, efficient and valuable
              inferences require  statistical models and inferential methodologies with
              correct  understandings of all these processes.
