Abstract    :
              9317784  Harrison    Regulation of pH is one of the most critical aspects of 
              organismal homeostasis.  Although acid-base status affects a wide  variety of
              cellular processes, including enzyme catalysis, ionic  balance, membrane
              transport, and hormone-receptor interactions,  our knowledge of this aspect of
              insect physiology is quite  limited.  Previous research by Dr. Harrison has
              shown that  locusts regulate extracellular pH quite closely, and that acid- 
              base loads resulting from diet, starvation, or injections of HCl  are excreted.
               A major goal of the proposed research is to  determine the specific region(s)
              of the alimentary canal/hindgut  complex responsible for the regulated
              excretion of acid-base  loads.  This research will also test whether changes in
              the  secretion of acid-base by the midgut can be directly induced by  changes
              in acid-base status.  It is generally assumed (in insects  and mammals) that
              excretion of ammonium is functionally  equivalent to acid excretion.  However,
              this assumption has never  been tested directly in insects, and recently has
              been  extensively debated for mammals.  The proposed study will test  whether
              ammonium excretion by the hindgut of locusts is  functionally equivalent to
              acid secretion in a simple, direct  manner.  Together, these experiments will
              provide the first  organismal model of the most important mechanisms of
              long-term  acid-base regulation in insects.  ***
