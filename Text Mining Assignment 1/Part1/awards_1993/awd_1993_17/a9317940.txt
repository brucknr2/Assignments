Abstract    :
              9317940  Malone    The primary objective of the workshop will be to identify 
              scientific and science-related issues important to the interaction  between
              global change and the future development of the society and  economy to bring
              to the attention of a meeting of donors to and  sponsors of global change
              research, e.g., national funding  agencies, international organizations,
              private foundations, etc.,  in November 1993 in Bellagio, Italy.  Workshop
              participants will  include the widest possible representation from relevant
              natural  and social science disciplines. The workshop will review recent 
              developments in the scientific understanding of global change and  consider how
              these and further improvements in such understanding  are likely to interact
              with and impact the future development of  the society and economy, especially
              the sustainable development of  both developed and developing countries.
