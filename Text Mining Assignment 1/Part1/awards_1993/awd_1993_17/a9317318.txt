Abstract    :
              9317318  Stock  This award supports a marine geophysical study of the southwest
              Pacific between 170  degrees E and 80 degrees W longitude.  Recent marine
              geophysical cruises in the  southwest Pacific and a high-resolution altimetric
              gravity field declassified Geosat data  have allowed significant progress to be
              made towards deciphering the complex history  of the rifting between the
              Campbell Plateau/Chatham Rise landmass and the Marie  Byrd Land margin.  A
              revised history of plate interactions explains many enigmatic  features seen in
              the magnetic and gravity fields yet several questions remain that  require new
              data for resolution.  The marine geophysical survey proposed will: (1) 
              elucidate plate interactions at the evolving triple junction between the
              Antarctic and  Australian plates and the mosaic of SW Pacific plates; (2)
              define the boundaries and  interactions of the mosaic of plates that
              accommodated the rapidly changing plate  geometry associated with subduction of
              the Pacific-Phoenix ridge outboard of New  Zealand, the rifting of continental
              and oceanic lithosphere, and hotspot activity; and (3)  map the development of
              Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and the assembly of the several small  plates into the
              modern day Pacific plate.  This survey will help to elucidate the  dynamics of
              plate interactions and the plate tectonic evolution of Antarctica and New 
              Zealand.  ***
