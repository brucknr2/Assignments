Abstract    :
              9317576  Jenski  This proposal's objective is to obtain funds to establish a
              fluorescence laboratory equipped with a research grade fluorescence
              spectrophotometer.  The fluorescence laboratory will be stationed in the
              Department of Biology (in the School of Science) at Indiana University - Purdue
              University at Indianapolis (IUPUI), serve four major and three minor users, and
              contain a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B Luminescence Spectrometer.  The Department now
              has only an old, very inadequate and heavily used fluorescence
              spectrophotometer.  As a result, research in existing labs has been  severely
              compromised and the development of new faculty will be hampered.    Unlike the
              old spectrophotometer, the LS-50B Luminescence Spectrometer will be able to
              maintain viable cells or heavy cell components in suspension, analyze cell
              monolayers, accept substance during a run, monitor at dual wavelengths in
              millisecond intervals, and rapidly read multiple samples.  The biologic
              applications for the fluorescence spectrophotomer include monitoring the
              expression of membrane proteins on cell monolayers, kinetics of protein
              redistribution on membrane surfaces, membrane permeability and fusion, membrane
              structure and dynamics, calcium binding proteins, and intracellular calcium and
              pH levels.  These experimental measurements are essential for the continued
              development of the research programs of the principal investigators.
