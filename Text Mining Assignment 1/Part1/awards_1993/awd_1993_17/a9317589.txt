              IBN-9317589  Tompkins                              Abstract    Hawaiian
              Drosophila species appear to have evolved very  rapidly.  This research
              project, at the interface of  chemistry and biology, investigates the extent to
              which the  chemical communication systems of the Hawaiian species have 
              diverged from those of their  continental counterparts.    Pheromones are
              chemicals synthesized by one individual that  affect the behavior of another
              individual.  Dr. Laurie  Tompkins, a biologist at Temple University, and Dr.
              Larry L.  Jackson, a chemist at Montana State University, are  investigating
              the  pheromones of a Hawaiian Drosophila species, D. adiastola.  This species
              is of particular interest because males raise  their abdomens over their heads,
              emitting droplets of fluid,  while performing courtship in response to females.
               Drs.  Tompkins and Jackson have discovered species-specific  chemical
              compounds in the males' droplets.  Moreover,  females of this species will mate
              only with D. adiastola  males, and they can distinguish D.  adiastola males
              from males of other, closely related species  even if they cannot see the
              males.  These observations  suggest that perception of the chemicals in males'
              droplets  enables females to distinguish different males.  Accordingly, Drs.
              Tompkins and  Jackson will attempt to identify the pheromones in males' 
              droplets.    Drs. Tompkins and Jackson have also shown that waxy  compounds on
              the cuticle ("skin") of D. adiastola females,  many of which are
              species-specific, stimulate males to court  the females and enable them to
              distinguish D. adiastola  females from females of another,  closely related
              species.  The researchers will attempt to  identify the compounds on females'
              cuticles that enable  males to tell different females apart.  In addition,
              since  some of the waxy compounds on males' cuticles are species-  specific,
              the researchers will try to determine whether or  not any of these compounds
              acts as a pheromone.
