Abstract    :
              9317988  Emlen                                ABSTRACT                          
                     This research is ultimately concerned with understanding  behavioral
              differences between females and males, an  extremely widespread biological
              phenomenon.  Evolutionary  theory and experimental evidence suggest that the
              amount of  time and energy invested in the care-taking of offspring may 
              strongly influence the options available to each sex.  Such  differences may
              have favored the expression of different  behaviors in males and females.   
              Among those animal species that show parental care, females  usually provide
              the bulk of such care, leaving males free to  increase their biological success
              through additional  matings.  Under such conditions, natural selection might be
               expected to have favored the development of different  strategies in the two
              sexes.  This has led to hypotheses  about why the sexes often adopt different
              roles during  interactions, why behavioral conflict between mates is so 
              common, and what forms of behavioral resolution can be  expected in such
              conflicts.    These ideas can be subjected to particularly critical test  by
              studying species in which care-taking responsibilities  are reversed from the
              "norm".  Dr. Emlen is studying an  extreme example of such a species, in which
              males look after  all offspring care and females increase their biological 
              success by having multiple male mates.  This research will  carefully document
              the behavioral roles adopted by males and  females and the contexts in which
              different roles are  expressed.  This will increase scientific understanding of
               why particular forms of behavior are favored by one sex over  the other, and
              of the evolutionary role of the expression of  such behaviors.
