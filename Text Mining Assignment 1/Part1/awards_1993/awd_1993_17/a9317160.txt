Abstract    :
              9317160     Weldon           This is a project whose goal is to characterize in
              detail the  faulting along a portion of the Mojave segment of the San Andreas 
              Fault, using geological means.  The project hopes to better  characterize rates
              and styles of faulting along the fault zone,  relate seismicity to surficial
              faults, and provide data to test  hypotheses for the physical behavior of the
              San Andreas Fault.  The  project is designed to provide data for preliminary
              site selection  for a proposed deep hole drilled into the San Andreas Fault
              Zone.   However, the project will generate data that is critical to 
              understanding the state of stress along the fault and the role that  geometry
              and secondary faults play in fault segmentation and  earthquake recurrence,
              regardless of whether the site is eventually  chosen for drilling.  ***
