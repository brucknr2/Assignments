Abstract    :
                  9317236  Numbers      This award will support the participation of ten
              senior and  junior U.S. investigators in a seminar entitled, "Responding to 
              Darwin: New Perspectives on the Darwinian Revolution" to be held  at the
              University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, in May 1994.  The American
              coordinator is Prof. Ronald Numbers of the   University of Wisconsin. The New
              Zealand organizer is  Dr. John Stenhouse of the Department of History at the 
              University of Otago. Support of this workshop in New Zealand  is being
              co-funded by the Royal Society of New Zealand and the  Alexander Turnbull
              Library in Wellington.    Participants will employ comparative methods to
              explore responses  to Darwinism in the U.S. and New Zealand, as well as in  
              Great Britain, Canada and Australia, geographical areas bound  together by
              common language. There exist no comprehensive studies  of Darwinism for these
              regions. The organizers have set forth an  array of comparative studies of the
              reception of evolutionary  theory among religions, races and genders.
