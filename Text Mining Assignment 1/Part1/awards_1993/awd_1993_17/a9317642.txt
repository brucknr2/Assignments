Abstract    :
              9317642  Ward   The comparative method offers a powerful technique for tracking
              change in functional complexes through time.  The origin and subsequent effects
              of an unusual cranial morphology are examined from this perspective in a group
              of Southeast Asian frogs (Ranidae).  Hormone analysis suggests that the
              occurrence of the unusual set of morphological traits and behaviors in this
              group is related to a reduction of testosterone levels and the development of
              parental care.  Proposed work includes continuing investigation of the proximal
              level of control for the expression of morphological characters, additional
              observations on the behavior of these unique frogs, and expanded phylogenetic
              (genealogical) analysis using both morphological and molecular characters.  The
              work will establish the relationship among the components of an apparent
              functional complex: reduced testosterone and the occurrence of male parental
              care.
