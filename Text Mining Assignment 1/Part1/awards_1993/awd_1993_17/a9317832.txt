Abstract    :
              9317832  Brunger  Computational approaches are important for structure 
              determination by X-ray crystallography and solution NMR  spectroscopy, studies
              of macromolecular structure/function  relationships, protein folding, structure
              prediction, and  drug design.  The proposed workstation cluster will enable  us
              to extend the limitations of these methods and to apply  them to more difficult
              and important biological problems.  The workstation cluster will also serve as
              a platform for  testing advanced algorithms for the parallelization of our 
              programs.    The main computational tool for the proposed projects is the 
              program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b).  We routinely use X-PLOR  for structure
              determination and refinement of X-ray and  solution NMR structures, as well as
              for free energy  perturbation calculations, structure prediction and certain 
              aspects of structure-based drug design.    It is proposed to acquire a
              workstation cluster which  provides the most cost-effective and flexible
              solution to  satisfy our needs.  X-PLOR performs very efficiently on the 
              proposed workstations.  We intend to primarily use the  cluster in a mode where
              multiple and independent jobs are  run independently on the processors.  Thus,
              we can readily  make use of the proposed cluster without extensive software 
              development.
