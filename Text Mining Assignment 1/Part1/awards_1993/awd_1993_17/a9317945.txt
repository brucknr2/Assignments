Abstract    :
              9317945  ZINK  The arid lands or deserts of southwestern North America provide
              an exciting context for phylogenetic and historical biogeographic studies. 
              Many sedentary taxa are endemic or restricted to desert regions, providing
              opportunities to explore patterns of isolation by past geologic events or
              climatic changes among various vertebrate lineages.  This research project will
              utilize molecular methods to explore relationships and biogeography of four
              groups of birds (thrashers, towhees, gnat catchers and quail) in these desert
              regions. Molecular variation among populations within the same species will
              also be discovered. For each group of bird species, patterns of relationship
              will be derived from restriction site and direct sequence data from
              mitochondrial DNA.  Those patterns will then be compared with each other to
              find any shared patterns suggesting a common geologic/climatic history for
              isolation of groups.    %%%  Studies such as this shed light on the subject of
              long term climate change and its effects in fragmenting populations that may
              lead to the origin of new species.  Information may also be obtained that bears
              on conservation efforts for these birds.  ***
