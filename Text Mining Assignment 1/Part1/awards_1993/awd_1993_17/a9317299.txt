Abstract    :
              9317299  O'Farrell    Cells develop in accord with their position within an 
              embryo. To do so, they either read position by communicating  with neighbors
              (regulative control), or inherit information  about position through lineage
              (determination). Typically,  embryonic cells go through a transition from
              regulative  control to determination. In Drosophila, we know many of the  genes
              that direct the fates of cells. The transition from  regulative control to
              determination should be associated  with a change in the regulation of these
              genes. One of these  genes, engrailed, directs cells to form the posterior
              parts  of segments. There is a multistepped transition in the  control of
              engrailed expression that appears to represent a  transition from regulative
              control to determination. Dr.  O'Farrell has defined four tiers of engrailed
              control:  initial patterning by localized transcription factors,  maintenance
              by the wingless signal, autoregulation and  control by Polycomb group genes.
              Dr. O'Farrell will  precisely define the relationship between the type of 
              control of engrailed and developmental determination. This  will involve the
              use of new lineage tracing methods and the  development of a method to follow
              gene expression in real  time. Additionally, he will begin biochemical analysis
              of  the involvement  of  Polycomb regulators in stable control  of engrailed
              expression.  ***
