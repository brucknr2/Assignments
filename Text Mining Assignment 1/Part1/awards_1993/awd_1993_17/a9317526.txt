Abstract    :
                  9317526  Harada  The long range scientific role of this project is to obtain
              a  mechanistic understanding of the processes that specify the  function and
              structure of glyoxysomes, subcellular organelles that  compartmentalize
              critical metabolic reactions in a cell.  In this  proposal, two key questions
              about glyoxysome formation are  considered.  First, how is the induction of
              glyoxysomal function  regulated during plant development?  This question will
              be  addressed by dissecting the processes regulating genes encoding two 
              glyoxysome-specific enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase,  that are
              required for glyoxysomal function.  Previous studies from  this lab established
              that transcriptional processes play the  primary role in regulating
              accumulation of these enzymes in  glyoxysomes.  Therefore, a mechanistic
              understanding of the  processes regulating expression of these two genes will
              provide  insight into the physiological signal(s) and pathway(s) that  control
              glyoxysomal function during plant development.  The second  key question will
              focus on glyoxysome assembly. What are the genes  that are required to
              establish the structure of the organelle and  to import proteins into
              peroxisomes, and how are these genes  regulated during development?  Genes
              involved in glyoxysome  assembly will be identified by selecting plant cDNA
              clones that  complement mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  In the long term,
               these approaches will provide a global overview of the processes  involved in
              glyoxysome formation.    The proposed studies will provide significant basic
              information  about the processes that establish an organelle's structure and 
              function.  Furthermore, infomation obtained from these studies may  be directly
              applicable to the design of strategies to improve crop  plants using genetic
              engineering protocals.  ***
