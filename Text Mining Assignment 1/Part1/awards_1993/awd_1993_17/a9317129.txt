Abstract    :
              9317129  Hanan       This award provides one-half the funding necessary for the 
              acquisition of an optical microscope system for the isotope geology  research
              group in the Department of Geological Sciences at San  Diego State University.
              The institution is committed to providing  the remaining funds required.      
              The microscope equipment is needed for mineral sample  selection and
              preparation prior to isotope analysis.  ***
