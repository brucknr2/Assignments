Abstract    :
              9317391  Endler       Secondary sexual traits are common in animals, and male 
              traits are sometimes so strongly developed that they appear  maladaptive. 
              Numerous theoretical models of sexual selection  attempt to account for the
              evolution of conspicuous sexual  display traits through female choice.  One
              property common to  most models is that female preferences should determine the
               direction of evolution of male traits.  However, most studies  look only at
              the single-generation effects of female choice of  males.  Dr. Endler will
              examine the long-term effects of changes  in female preferences.  What factors
              cause sexually selected  traits to evolve in particular directions?%%%      
              One possible evolutionary bias is in the perception of  traits by the sensory
              system; some traits are more easily  perceived than others, and given that
              sensory systems are more  sensitive to some aspects of signal than others,
              discrimination  is easier for some aspects of signal than others.  Dr Endler
              will  examine the effects of sensory biases by means of an extensive 
              artificial selection of female preferences and its secondary  effects on male
              traits in Poecilia reticulata.  These questions  are not only interesting and
              important from the viewpoint of  sexual selection, but also have important
              implications for the  origin and maintenance of species because sexually
              selected  traits are often used in species recognition and isolation.***
