Abstract    :
              9317451   Yeo       Mount St. Mary's College requests support from NSF for 
              connection of their campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the  midlevel
              network located in the southeastern United States.  It  will provide operations
              management and information services and  it will give Mount St. Mary's College
              a 56 thousand bits per  second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million  bits per second) National Backbone network.       Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.   By linking to the mid-level and national
              networks, Mount St.  Mary's faculty and academics will maintain a position of 
              leadership in research and educational innovation by profiting  from remote
              access to super computer centers, data bases and  information services, high
              speed communications, file transfer  and remote login, and access to library
              resources. This is also a  unique opportunity for the school to explore
              innovative  educational resources.
