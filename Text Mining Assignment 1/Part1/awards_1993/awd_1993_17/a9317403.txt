Abstract    :
              9317403  Smith    Dr. Smith will carry out charge-coupled-device (CCD)
              observations  of variable stars in a one degree square region of the Small 
              Magellanic Cloud.  These observations follow on a photographic  survey which
              showed this region to be rich in variable stars.   The data will be used to:
              (1) complete the discovery of variable  stars in this field; (2) determine
              periods and lightcurves for  the variables; and (3) produce a color-magnitude
              diagram for  approximately 40,000 nonvariable stars within the field.
