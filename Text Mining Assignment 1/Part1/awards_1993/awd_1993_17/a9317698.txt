Abstract    :
              9317698  Caraco  Using direct measurements of the partial pressure of CO2, we
              and others have been finding that the surface waters of lakes are rarely in
              equilibrium with the atmosphere with respect to CO2.  Aqueous carbon dioxide
              concentrations  CO2aq  in surface waters vary seasonally and across lakes from
              less than one-tenth to more than ten-fold of their equilibrium concentration
              with the atmospheric CO2 of less than 2-fold.  Neither the causes nor the
              consequences of the enormous range in CO2 concentrations in aquatic ecosystems
              is well understood.  %%%  Causes.  The surface waters of lakes can be under-or
              over saturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere.  The causes of severe
              under saturation are relatively well understood.  Excess nutrient inputs
              (nitrogen and phosphorus) from the watershed allow increased primary production
              and carbon burial which draws down the CO2 concentration.  Although this model
              is reasonable, it has only been tested in a few experimentally eutrophied lakes
              and it is not known how generally applicable it is.  The causes of CO2 super
              saturation are much less well investigated and all the more intriguing because
              the data suggest that a majority of lakes are, in fact, super saturated much of
              the time.  A lake supersaturated in CO2 must be a net source of CO2 to the
              atmosphere.  Our preliminary data and review suggest that most lakes are net
              CO2 sources over an annual cycle and many are sources even during the summer
              growing season.  This net evasion of CO2 from aquatic systems implies an
              important and relatively unexplored linkage between the lake and its watershed.
               These lakes must either import and metabolize significant amounts of
              terrestrially-derived organic matter or they import CO2 from soil respiration
              in inflowing  ground water.  Either way, the flux of CO2 from aquatic systems
              is a large component of a lake's carbon budgets and warrants further study. We
              hypothesize that the way a lake is linked to its watershed drives these extreme
              variations in aquati c CO2.  %%%  Consequences. Relatively small variations in
              atmospheric CO2 (2-fold) can have large effects on terrestrial plants,
              including changes in the rate of productivity, and alteration of the elemental
              composition of plant material.  The effects of the much larger variations in
              CO2 in aquatic systems are less well known, especially for phytoplankton.  We
              hypothesize that the more than 100-fold range in CO2 concentrations in natural
              aquatic systems may affect phytoplankton species composition, C:P and C:N
              ratios of phytoplankton and may alter profoundly the value of phytoplankton as
              food for consumer organisms.  %%%  Goals.  1)  To determine under what
              conditions lakes are sources or sinks for atmospheric CO2; 2)  To identify the
              sources of excess CO2 in a single lake(Mirror L) which we know outgasses CO2
              during most of the year; and 3)  To investigate, using manipulative
              experiments, the effect this dramatic range in CO2 concentrations has on
              phytoplankton species composition.
