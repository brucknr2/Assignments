Abstract    :
              9317881  Wiley  The acanthomorph fishes are the largest group of vertebrate
              animals (13,290) species).  This group includes some of the most important
              commercial and sports fishes such as tunas, basses, founders, cods, and
              billfishes.  Unfortunately, little is known, or agreed upon, concerning the
              relationships among the more than 13 orders and numerous suborders of
              acanthomorphs.  This hampers our ability to understand many aspects of the
              biology of these fishes.  Some of these aspects will undoubtedly have
              commercial as well as purely scientific consequences.  We propose to use
              morphological data and molecular data derived from DNA sequencing to study the
              relationships among acantrhomorph fishes.  Morphological data used by previous
              investigators to arrive at conflicting hypotheses of relationships will be
              re-evaluated and new data will be collected. A pilot study is presented that
              demonstrates the feasibility for using DNA sequence data to further resolve
              these relationships  ***
