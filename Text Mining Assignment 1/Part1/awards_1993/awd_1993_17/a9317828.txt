Abstract    :
              9317828  Beck       Research will focus on the theoretical calculation of the 
              properties of lanthanide and actinide atoms and negative ions.  The lanthanides
              are beginning to be studied experimentally using  accelerator mass spectrometry
              and little is known about the  electron affinities of the negative ions.  Many
              body and  relativisitic effects will be included in order to obtain  reliable
              results.  The relativistic configuration interaction  method developed under
              the previous grant is now sufficiently  mature to undertake the challenge of
              this complicated atomic  species.  ***
