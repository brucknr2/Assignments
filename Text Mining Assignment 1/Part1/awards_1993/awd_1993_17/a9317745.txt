Abstract    :
              9317745  Cerrina  The P.I. propose a research program to extend the application
              of X-ray lithography to sub-).25 um devices.  The previous phases of this
              research program have led to key developments in the area of X-ray lithography.
               The P.I. will continue the refinement and development of software, processes
              and experimental tools, to explore the extendibility of the applications of
              X-ray lithography to the new domains of sub 0.1 um critical dimensions.  The
              proposed research program is twofold, addressing both the need of developing
              0.25 (256 Mbit DRAMs) and 0.17 (1 Gbit) um key lithographic processes, as well
              as studying the longer term goal of the application of X-ray lithography to
              sub-0.1 um dimensions.  The proposed program includes (1) the extension of the
              modeling codes, (2) X-ray mask optimization and phase shifting masks, (3)
              High-precision alignment systems, (4) Diffractive X-ray optical elements and
              (5) X-ray masks replication.  The research program will be carried out at the
              Center for X-ray Lithography, where a full set of X-ray lithography processing
              tools are available.  Technology transfer is already in place thanks to the
              collaborations with the SEMATECH Center of Excellence and with Motorola Inc.
