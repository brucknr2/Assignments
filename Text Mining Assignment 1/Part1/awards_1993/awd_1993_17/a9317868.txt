Abstract    :
              IBN-9317868  Stewart Hulse    Animal communication is an important biological
              process, playing   a role in mate choice, predation and sociality, for example.
               It   also has considerable practical significance.  Sound provides an  
              important channel for much animal communication.  Dr. Hulse will   study how
              auditory communication takes place.  We know a great   deal about what animals
              "say" to one another.  However, we know   less about how animals make sense out
              of what they hear.  A   series of experiments using complex artificial and
              natural sounds   will shed new light on auditory perception.  Behavioral tests 
               will be used to analyze the perceptual processes underlying the   ability of
              songbirds to discriminate and classify sounds based on   their pitch, spectral
              structure and temporal structure.  These   studies of auditory perception and
              communication are interesting   not only in their own right, but also because
              they may eventually   help us to understand communication processes generally
              -- such   as the brain and behavioral processes underlying human language   and
              speech.
