Abstract    :
              9317479  Stone     Strengthening mechanisms in molybdenum and tantalum/nitrogen
              thin  films are explored using unique indentation apparatus.  The film 
              compositions are selected as model systems to examine solid  solution
              strengthening and the Hall-Petch effect.  Film thicknesses  on the order of 2
              to 5 microns are deposited on hard substrates.   Emphasis is placed on
              determining the effects of indentation rate  and temperature on the hardness,
              as a function of grain size, alloy  content, and structure form.  The kinetics
              of plastic deformation  are characterized by load and depth sensing techniques
              and wafer  curvature stress measurements.  Results should permit a 
              determination of how well laws governing the kinetics of  deformation in bulk
              materials relate to behavior in thin films.  %%%  The research will provide an
              improved understanding of deformation  phenomena in hard coatings.  This
              knowledge can lead to new  strategies for depositing thin films to achieve
              improved  properties.  ***
