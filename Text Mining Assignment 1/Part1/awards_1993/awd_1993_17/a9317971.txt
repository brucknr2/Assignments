Abstract    :
              9317971  Cohen  Current scientific and resource policy problems revolve around
              the spatial dynamics of ecosystems and landscapes.  For example, global climate
              change will not be equal everywhere and the responses of ecosystems to it
              depend in their distribution relative important spatial components include seed
              dispersal, which determines migration of plant species across the landscape,
              and habitat structure for birds which disperse those seeds.  Until recently,
              computational tools for analyzing spatial dynamics have been lacking.  Recent
              developments in supercomputers and video display technology make the
              interfacing of population, ecosystem, and landscape models feasible, thus
              providing solutions to large-scale ecological problems.  We propose to
              incorporate mechanisms of seed dispersal and bird habitat suitability into an
              existing forest ecosystem model, develop visualization techniques for two and
              three dimensional display of simulated landscapes, and further develop
              mathematical techniques for analyzing model output.  This work takes advantage
              of the new power in supercomputing and will develop tools for use on parallel
              architecture's.  Software will be made available through Internet, workshops,
              etc.  This award is being jointly supported by programs in Ecosystems Studies
              and Computational Biology.
