This program targets undergraduate biology students,
              particularly minorities, and is designed to direct them toward advanced
              training and careers in environmental biology.  Student participants will be
              recruited from predominantly minority colleges and universities in the area
              (e.g. Chicago State University), from the pool of minority students already
              affiliated with programs at the Museum, and from major research universities in
              the local area (e.g. University of Chicago).  Students will be involved in an
              intensive program consisting of two phases.  In phase one, with funding from
              the Field Museum, students will be trained  in organismal biology and
              systematic and collection management techniques.  The focus of this work is the
              analysis of biodiversity.  During the second phase, students working closely
              with a research scientist mentor will create and carry out their own research
              projects, prepare the results for publication and present them to the
              participant group.  The Field Museum is a center for regional research, and
              students will have access to facilities at the Brookfield Zoo, The University
              of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Northwestern University.
               In parallel with this academic program the program will also implement a
              variety of mentoring and advisory activities to ensure that all student derive
              maximum benefit from their experience and receive appropriate guidance and
              encouragement on personal and career development.
