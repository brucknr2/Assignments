                  9317885 Fogleman/Mcintyre          Cytochrome P450 genes produce enzymes
              that allow insects to tolerate poisonous chemicals such as insecticides and
              certain plant compounds.  Some plants protect themselves from insects (and
              other herbivores) by making chemical compounds that are toxic in the animals
              which try to feed on them.  Cytochrome P450 enzymes detoxify chemical
              compounds, usually by changing their chemical structure.  The study of P450
              genes, therefore, will provide information as to how insects become resistant
              to insecticides and/or plant defensive chemicals. %%%          This proposal
              involves the use of an insect plant model system.  The insects are fruit flies
              of the genus Drosophila, and the plants are columnar cacti which grow in the
              Sonoran Desert of Southwestern United States and Mexico.  A wealth of
              background information on this model system has already been obtained including
              data on the ecology and genetics of the fruit flies and identification and
              characterization of the toxic chemicals that the cacti produce.  Employing
              modern techniques of molecular genetics, the experiments included in this
              proposal will investigate how P450 genes evolve and how they are regulated.  A
              better understanding of the mechanisms by which insects evolve P450 mediated
              resistance and by which P450 resistance genes are genetically regulated would
              represent a major advancement in the areas of insect ecological genetics and
              evolution.
