Abstract    :
              9317509  Kechris       This project concentrates on the descriptive set theory
              of  definable group actions and equivalence relations.  In  particular, it
              deals with Borel actions of Polish groups on  Polish spaces, their orbit
              equivalence relations, the structure  and classification of countable Borel
              equivalence relations, the  theory of general Borel equivalence relations, and
              definable  cardinality theory.       Set theory lies at the foundation of all
              mathematics.  On  the one hand, it provides a form of intellectual hygiene, 
              protecting against paradox and contradiction.  On the other hand,  it lies so
              deeply behind everything that it sometimes permits  derivation  of very general
              results with application in widely  separated branches of mathematics.  ***
