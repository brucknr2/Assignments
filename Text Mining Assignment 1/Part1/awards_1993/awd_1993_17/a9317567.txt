Abstract    :
              9317567  Evans    Star Formation and Molecular Clouds.    The primary goals of
              this project are improved understanding of star  formation and molecular
              clouds.  The project is a three-year collaborative  program, focused on
              submillimeter observations at the Caltech Submillimeter  Observatory, but
              includes observations at other wavelengths and directly  related efforts in
              modeling and instrumentation.  Areas of investigation range  from small
              molecular clouds and small cores in larger clouds, to large scale  maps of
              spectral lines of atoms and molecules, to studies of star formation  and
              molecular clouds on a galactic scale.
