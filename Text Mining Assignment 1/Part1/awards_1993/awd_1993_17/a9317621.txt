Abstract    :
                                          Abstract    9317621  LaBelle  This project involves
              the operation of sensitive radio receivers  operating in a frequency-swept mode
              from 0.1 MHz to 5.0 MHz.  The  resulting spectra will be used to study the
              physical mechanisms in  the magnetosphere and ionosphere which are responsible
              for the  radio waves, for example, the mechanisms which accelerate the 
              electrons which cause aurora.    This award will continue support for the
              receivers already  operating at South Pole and in the U.S. Antarctic Program
              Automatic  Geophysical Observatories in Antarctica and will also support the 
              construction and operation of two more receivers which will be  installed in
              British Antarctic Survey Automatic Geophysical  Observatories in Antarctica.   
              Also, the project complements the data being produced by a similar  instrument
              which is located in the northern auroral zone at Two  Rivers, AK.  The Alaska
              project is supported by the Atmospheric  Sciences Division of NSF.   
              Additional support for this project is provided by a separate  Presidential
              Young Investigator grant to the Principle  Investigator.  Funding for the PYI
              grant is split between the  Division of Atmospheric Sciences and the Office of
              Polar Programs.  ***
