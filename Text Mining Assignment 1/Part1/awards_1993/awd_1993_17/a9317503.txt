Abstract    :
              9317503  Malamy  Conjugal transposons are genetic units that play an important
              role  in the dissemination of genetic information in bacteria.  They  combine
              the characteristics of transposons and conjugal elements in  a single unit. 
              Conjugal transposons have been extensively studied  in the Gram positive cocci:
              we have recently described Tn4399, a  conjugal mobilizing transposon from the
              important human pathogen,  the Gram negative anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis.  We
              are continuing  our studies to characterize the transposition and transfer 
              properties of Tn4399. We will concentrate on the proteins and sites  within
              Tn4399 that are required for its ability to transfer from B.  fragilis donor
              cells and to be mobilized by the IncP plasmids, RP4  and R751, in E. coli.  We
              have defined a 2.8 kb region of Tn4399,  that contains the "mobilization
              cassette" which is sufficient for  IncP plasmid mobilization.  We will
              determine if this unit can  promote plasmid transfer from B. fragilis donor
              cells, or if other  proteins must be supplied in trans.  We have identified two
              Tn4399  proteins, MocA and MocB, and an oriT4399 site that are required for 
              IncP plasmid mobilization in E. coli. We will determine if these  proteins, and
              site are required for Tn4399 promoted transfer in B.  fragilis.  To develop a
              genetic tool that can be used to map the B.  fragilis chromosome, we will
              engineer Tm4399 insertions into the B.  fragilis chromosome at known locations
              and determine if B. fragilis  chromosomal DNA can now be transferred to
              recipient cells.  To  study the transposition properties of Tn4399 we will
              attempt to  establish plasmid-to-plasmid, and chromosome-to plasmid 
              transposition systems.  It may be that Tn4399 is not fully  competent for
              transposition and may need proteins supplied in trans  from the chromosomal TET
              transfer element TUF present in the  original transposon donor cell.  We will
              test this hypothesis using  a new set of plasmids in B.fragilis cells
              containing TET element  TUF on the chromosom e.  If these experiments are
              successful, we  will begin to determine the role in transposition of the
              terminal  inverted repeats and the five extra basepairs at the right end of 
              the element, which are a unique feature of Tn4399.   The studies of  Tn4399
              described above should provide important information on the  mechanisms of
              conjugal  DNA transfer from B. fragilis donor cells,  the mechanism of
              transposition of this novel elements, and help to  create a genetic system for
              the analysis of the chromosome of B.  fragilis.  %%%  Understanding the
              interaction of Tn4399 and the IncP broad host  range plasmids will provide
              insights into the dissemination of  genetic information to a wide variety of
              medically important  bacterial species.  ***
