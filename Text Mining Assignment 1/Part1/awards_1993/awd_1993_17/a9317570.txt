Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic
              Chemistry Program, Dr. Thomas Flood, Chemistry Department,   University of
              Southern California, will undertake synthetic and   mechanistic studies of
              reactions between hydrocarbons and transition   metal complexes. The reaction
              types to be investigated are fundamental to   all of organometallic chemistry
              and transition metal-based catalysis with   the targeted systems providing
              well-defined examples in which   carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, and
              carbon-oxygen bonds are formed and/or   cleaved. A variety of effects which may
              influence these reactions will be   evaluated, with particular attention being
              paid to a comparison between   amine and more conventional ligands. Mechanistic
              studies will be carried   out using physical and spectroscopic methods.   
              Carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, and/or carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken  
              and/or formed in countless chemical reactions, including those involved   in
              many industrial processes. A large number of these reactions are   facilitated
              by metal containing catalysts. Consequently, an understanding   of how metals
              mediate such processes and how they interact with reacting   species is of
              profound importance. This research will both improve our   fundamental
              understanding of these important processes and provide the   information needed
              to design more efficient metal catalysts.
