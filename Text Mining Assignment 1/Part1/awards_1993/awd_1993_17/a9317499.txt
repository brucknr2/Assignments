Abstract    :
              9317499  Clancy  Sporulation in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a
              cell-type specific response to nutritional signals.  Only MATa/MAT alpha
              diploids can sporulate; cells that contain only one of the MAR alleles, or
              mutations at MAR, cannot do so.  Work in several laboratories has identified
              key regulators through which the mating type locus controls the sporulation
              response.  Of central importance are an activator of meiosis (IME1) that is
              highly expressed in starved MATa/MAT alpha diploids, and a repressor of meiosis
              (RME1) that is poorly expressed in these cells this work is aimed at
              understanding the regulation and function of a newly-described activator,
              called IME4.  Like IME1, IME4 is normally expressed only in starved MATa/MAT
              alpha cells and not in the other cell types.  Unlike IME1, however, IME4 is not
              regulated by RME1 repressor.  Rather, a different intermediate is used to
              transmit mating type information to IME4.  One important goal of this work is
              to understand the nature and identity of this unknown intermediate, and the
              targets at IME4 upon which it acts.  IME4 is formally upstream of IME1 in this
              genetic pathway, because strains that lack IME4 do not express IME1 and do not
              sporulate.  However, mutations that allow expression of IME1 without IME4 do
              not restore sporulation.  This suggests that IME4 plays additional roles in
              sporulation, apart from stimulating IME1 expression.  We plan to define these
              roles genetically, by identifying suppressors of this downstream defect and by
              defining mutation phenotypes more precisely.  To better understand the function
              of IME4, we will identify proteins that interact with the IME4 product, and
              determine the location of the product in the cells.  %%%  This research will
              aid in our understanding of gene expression in yeast, an organism of important
              to the biotechnology industry.  In addition, it will help to train a number of
              undergraduate students in current techniques in modern molecular biology.  ***
