Abstract    :
              Solid modeling is a critical enabling technology for mechanical  CAD/CAM because
              it provides geometrically complete representations  of parts and products, and
              enables important manufacturing  processes to be modeled.  Today's industrial
              systems operate far  below the technology's potential because solid modeling
              requires  enormous computing resources, and because current algorithms and 
              representations cannot handle several important applications.    This project
              is designing new implementations of ray-casting  representations for the solid
              models used in mechanical CAD, and  extending the models to new applications. 
              New implementations for  ray-casting engines are being developed, using both
              custom hardware  and software running on massively parallel machines.  Using
              the new  hardware, new applications of ray representations are being  explored,
              including the solution of boundary-value problems,  computation of medial axis
              transforms, methods for representing  mechanical tolerances, and representation
              of solid objects.
