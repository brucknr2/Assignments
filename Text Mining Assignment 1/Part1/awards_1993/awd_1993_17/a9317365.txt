Abstract    :
                      9317365  Zargaryan  The purpose of this exploratory research is to
              develop a new  approach, based on the use of asymptotic expansions to generate 
              successive approximations, for the prediction of the macro-  mechanical
              properties of heterogeneous materials (e.g., composites)  and for the
              simultaneous determination of the global response of  structural and mechanical
              components fabricated from these  materials.  In addition, this method permits
              the calculation of  local states of stress and deformation at or near the
              various  interfaces in the material, which is essential for the prediction  of
              failure.  ***
