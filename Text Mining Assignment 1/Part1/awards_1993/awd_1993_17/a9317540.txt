Abstract    :
                          9317540  Guy  The various physical components of the natural
              environment are  rarely optimal with respect to growth and development over the
              life  cycle of any given organism.  Because terrestrial environments are 
              dynamic, most plants have evolved mechanisms to cope with  marginally
              unfavorable conditions that may otherwise be  deleterious.  While physically
              different environmental conditions  may injure plants in quite unique ways,
              certain cellular  consequences of injury may be common to what would be viewed
              as  rather divergent environmental stresses.  The work outlined in this 
              proposal continues to focus attention on the fundamental role of a  class of
              molecular chaperones, the stress 70 family, in the basic  functioning of the
              plant cell and in the organism as a whole during  normal growth and
              development, as well as when subjected to  suboptimal and deleterious
              environmental condition.  It has been  demonstrated that one of the responses
              of spinach to low  nonfreezing temperture exposure involves an increased level
              of  expression for one or more members of the heat shock 70 family.   The
              objectives of the research are to: 1, determine the expression  responses for
              all members of this family to both short and long  term exposure to low
              temperature; 2, define the expression patterns  for all the members of the
              family in response to the complement of  environmental parameters of
              significance to plants; 3, examine the  phenotypic consequences resulting from
              over-and under-expression in  transgenic plants; and 4, continue the
              biochemical analyses of the  purified proteins with respect to peptide binding
              and its role in  protein assembly.  Together the aggregate of this work will be
              to  not only examine the molecular chaperone function of HSP/C70s, but  to test
              the hypothesis that this family of proteins plays an  important role in protein
              assembly and disassembly in plants at low  temperatures. ***
