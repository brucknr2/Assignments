Abstract    :
              9317652  Morse                              Abstract    Birds and mammals learn
              how and where to find food, but most  people would assume that invertebrates
              such as spiders do  not learn from experience, developing their adult foraging 
              behaviors solely through maturation.  Dr. Morse will test  this assumption by
              examining the role of experience in the  development of choice of hunting site
              ("patch choice") of  the crab spider, a sit-and-wait predator on flowers.  His 
              previous research has established the importance of success  in juvenile patch
              choice, because it affects the spider's  chances of becoming an adult. 
              Further, if one succeeds in  becoming an adult, earlier patch choice may affect
              the  chances of capturing enough prey to produce a clutch of  eggs, which will
              differ markedly in size and resultant  lifetime fitness with adult success. 
              Dr. Morse has  carefully worked out the relationship between adult foraging 
              success and lifetime fitness of the crab spider, making it a  uniquely suitable
              species for studying the role of juvenile  learning on adult fitness, a problem
              on which virtually no  information exists.  Dr. Morse will focus on two aspects
              of  the role of experience:  the effect of juvenile patch choice  on
              immediately subsequent choices, and the effect of such  juvenile experience on
              choices subsequently made as adults.  Experiments will be run both in field
              enclosures and in  laboratory settings, carefully controlling for prey type and
               spatial and temporal distribution of prey.
