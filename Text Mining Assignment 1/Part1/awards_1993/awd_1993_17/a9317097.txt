Abstract    :
              9317097  Kambysellis  Craddock    This award supports collaboration between
              Michael Kambysellis,  New York University, and Peng Tongxu, Guangdong
              Entomological  Institute, on the evolution of Chinese Drosophila and the 
              comparison of the biology of island endemic species (Hawaii) with  species
              endemic to continents. This will be a multiyear  collaboration with part of the
              work being carried out in  Guangzhou and part in New York.      The
              collaborative arrangements will provide the opportunity to  examine the
              speciose Chinese Drosophila fauna and make  comparisons to the extraordinary
              drosophila fauna of the Hawaiian  Island. This work contributes to the current
              worldwide efforts to  understand and catalogue global biodiversity.  The
              project will  involve participation of graduate students in both China and the 
              United States.
