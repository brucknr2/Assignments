Abstract    :
              9317176  Phipps Morgan      The PI will develop simple model descriptions of
              large-scale lateral viscosity variation near the top of the mantle, and develop
              simple and computationally efficient theories to treat mantle rheologies where
              the mantle viscosity is radially dependent except for significant lateral
              variation near the top.  Since this is likely to be the largest lateral
              viscosity variation in the mantle, by exploring these effects, one can better
              understand the coupling between lateral viscosity variations, mantle flow and
              the geoid.  These models will make it possible to assess the dynamical effects
              of the distribution of (strong) continental cratons and (weaker) sub-oceanic
              asthenosphere on mantle flow.  In addition, these models will provide useful
              benchmarks to guide us in the development of a 3-D spherical, variable
              viscosity convection code.  ****
