Abstract    :
              Abstract   University of Illinois - Chicago - K. DahlenID,u   Connection to
              NSFNET  Proposal No. NCR-9317686  The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)
              needs to  significantly expand its intra-campus connections to resources 
              available through the NSFNET.  At the same time, the University  needs to
              provide a means of integrating Internet resources and  networked connectivity
              into its existing information services.    An integral part of this plan is to
              educate nursing students,  educators, researchers, and practitioners to the
              advantages of  campus and Internet resources by promoting access and networked 
              connectivity and mechanisms for improving communication,  increasing
              information access, and for sharing knowledge.  The  long-term goal is to
              extend this prototype to the other health  professional schools and to the
              campus as a whole.      The main objectives are: to streamline library
              operations and  connectivity; to improve patron service; to develop new forms
              of  collaboration and knowledge-sharing among nursing practitioners  in the
              field; and to test educational strategies to integrate  Internet resources into
              both the curriculum and practice of  nursing.
