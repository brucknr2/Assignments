Abstract    :
              9317795  Lang       This award continues a cooperative research program using
              the  VLA and the RATAN 600 radio telescopes to study the sun.  It  involves
              collaborative research, lectures and student involvement  that contribute to
              the education and development of young  scientists in the US and Russia.  The
              coordinated observations  which will be made using three instruments will
              provide new  information to study large-scale coronal magnetic structures.  The
               observations will be made at a time of decreased solar activity  when the
              compact, intense active regions will no longer dominate  radio or soft X-ray
              images, and the large collecting area of the  radio telescopes can be used to
              delineate the fainter, large-scale  structures.  Solar observations taken on
              the same day by the VLA  and the RATAN 600 will be compared during two one-week
              visits per  year for scientists to the host country.  These visits will also 
              include lectures and student involvement.  ***
