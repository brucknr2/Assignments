                    ABSTRACT    P.I.  Anna Di Rienzo  SBR- 9317266    Simple sequence repeats
              (SSR's or microsatellites) are a group of repetitive DNA sequences that show
              very high levels of variation in length.  They are found in a broad range of
              eukaryotes, particularly mammals.   They they have become particularly
              important in human genetics because 1) the instability of some SSRs is the root
              cause of some diseases, including some forms of cancer, fragile X mental
              retardation syndrome, and Huntington's disease, 2) they have become the tool of
              choice to construct linkage maps of the entire genome, and 3) the appear to be
              a very powerful tool for studies of genomic diversity in humans, and for
              reconstructing human population histories.      This study, by an extremely
              well-trained younger scientist, will survey SSRs and their variability
              extensively in carefully chosen human populations.  She and her group will
              analyze at least 100 SSRs in order to characterize how the mutation process
              occurs - if in single steps, or multiple steps.  They will estimate the
              proportion of multi-step and single-step mutation events for each locus.  In
              addition, they will reconstruct the population histories of the six populations
              to be examined by sequencing the most variable region of mtDNA in the same
              samples, so that this can be compared with the pattern of differences in SSRs. 
              This reconstruction will determine the most realistic population scenarios for
              simulation of the mutation process models, and will allow the dissection of the
              mutational events leading to the observed population variation.    ***
