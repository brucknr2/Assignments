              hybridization between plant species is of fundamental importance for
              understanding the evolution of plants.  This is due to the fact that an
              estimated 70% of all plant species have arisen through natural crosses between
              other species.  Furthermore, almost all food and fiber crops used by humans
              reflect the result of natural or manmade crosses resulting in improved
              productivity and nutritive value.  The studies outlined in this proposal will
              examine the effect of pollen tube growth rate, seed abortion and patterns of
              insect and bird pollinations on the success of natural crosses between the
              plant species    Iris       fulva   ,    Iris       hexagona   , and    Iris   
                 brevicaulis   .  These plants hybridize readily under artificial conditions
              and there are numerous natural hybrid populations formed by crosses between the
              species.  Therefore, this species complex will allow a determination of what
              processes are important in limiting and promoting natural and experimental
              hybridization.  Such an understanding should allow a better definition of how
              natural hybridization has come about in numerous plant species.  In addition,
              data from these studies will be very applicable to plant breeders who need to
              know what mechanisms might restrict their attempts to cross agriculturally
              important species and thus limit the efficiency of crossing programs.
