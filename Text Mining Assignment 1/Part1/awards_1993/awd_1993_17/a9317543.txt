Abstract    :
              9317543  Nieto    The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I
              transplantation  antigens function as restriction elements for the presentation
              of  viral and foreign antigens to the T cell receptor.  Antigen is  presented
              to the T cell receptor in the form of a peptide which  binds within the helical
              bordered cleft of the class I molecule.   The molecular interactions involved
              in the presentation of the  peptide receptor are not fully understood. 
              Preliminary results  suggest that the class I molecule is structurally flexible
              and  susceptible to structural perturbations induced by beta-2  microglobulin,
              a 12 Kd protein non-covalently associated with class  I at the cell surface. 
              This research is designed to address the  role of class I structural
              flexibility and the relationship it has  to class I function.  Specifically,
              the role of beta-2  microglobulin in overall class I structure and function
              will be  investigated.  Discerning the role of beta-2 microglobulin in class  I
              structure will provide insight into the ability of class I to  bind and present
              a vast array of disparate antigenic peptides to  the T cell receptor.  %%%  The
              transplantation antigens were first shown to be responsible for  rejection of
              tissue transplants in mice.  The transplantation  antigens are cell surface
              protein molecules encoded by a multigene  complex known as the Major
              Histocompatibility Complex (MHC).  The  major gene families in this complex
              have been designated class I,  II, and III.  Products of the genes are now
              known to play a crucial  role in the recognition by the immune system of cells
              bearing  foreign antigens on their surfaces.  The subject of this research  is
              how the structure of the Class I molecule and an associated  protein, known as
              beta-2 microglobulin, affect their function in  recognizing foreign molecules. 
              This research will be carried out  by a new investigator at a predominantly
              undergraduate institution.   This research, therefore will not only contribute
              to our  understanding of rec ognition and response mechanisms in immune 
              function, but also enrich the environment for science education at  an
              institution with a high proportion of minority undergraduates.  ***
