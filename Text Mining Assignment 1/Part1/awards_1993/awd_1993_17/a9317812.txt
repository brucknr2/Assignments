Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9317812  Texas A&M Research Fdn  P.I.:  Philip T. Eubank      New
              procedures are developed for use with the recent Wong-Sandler mixing rules for
              the prediction of mixture phase equlibria from cubic equations of state. 
              Improvements in the apriori evaluation of  both the liquid-phase parameter
              {SYMBOL 65 \f "GreekMathSymbols"}E and the gas-phase parameter B12EOS  (or K12)
              are made. An important new procedure is developed where the latter parameter is
              found from experimental measurements of the cross second virial coefficient
              B12Exp in the single-phase vapor mixture at low pressures.  Apriori prediction
              of phase equlibria to high pressures and temperatures then follows when the
              liquid-phase parameter AE is estimated from a group-contribution method, such
              as UNIFAC.  An order-of-magnitude analysis shows the resultant phase equlibria
              to be more sensitive to the gas-phase parameter B12EOS .  These new procedures
              are most promising in the prediction (not correlation) of the phase behavior of
              complex systems, such as CO2/H2O/oil in petroleum reservoirs undergoing CO2
              and/or steam flooding.
