Abstract    :
              9317424  Thompson     This research examines the geographical variation in the
              ecological relationships between Greyia moths and their host plants in the
              plant family Saxifragaceae.  There is considerable geographic variation in the
              degree of mutualism vs. exploitation in the moths' relationship with their
              usual host plant (Lithophragma) and in switching over to an alternative
              saxifragaceous host, Heuchera.  This geographic variation is used to address
              the origins of host switching and how mutualisms are derived from antagonisms
              and vice versa.  The three objectives of this research are to determine
              whether: 1) Heuchera-feeding Greyia politella populations are genetically
              differentiated from Lithophragma-feeding populations, 2) host shifts are
              associated with plant chromosome number, and 3) the host shift to Heuchera has
              resulted in a mutualistic relationship.    %%%  Geographic variation in
              plant-insect relationships has been largely ignored in previous studies.  Such
              variation provides important clues into how mutualistic and antagonistic
              relationships between organisms originate and change with time.  This project
              is novel in addressing important questions about the origins of antagonisms and
              mutualisms between insects and their host plants and in examining the
              geographic variation in these relationships.  Information from this research
              could have important applications to biological control and other pest
              management methods in agriculture and forestry.  ***
