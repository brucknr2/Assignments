Abstract    :
              9317244  Long    Saline ground-water seeps have been recently found entering
              Lake  Ontario.  Although stable isotope and geochemical analyses indicate  that
              the saline ground water is from regional saline formation  water, the source
              for the formation water is not well constrained.   Geochemical and isotopic
              evidence indicates that high Cl values in  the water of Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron
              may be in part caused by the  direct discharge to the bay of saline ground
              water from saline  formation water from the Michigan basin.  Since the source
              and  hydrogeology of the Saginaw Bay area is better constrained than in  Lake
              Ontario, Saginaw Bay is an excellent site to study the  interaction of
              saline-formation water, near-surface ground water,  and large lakes.  The
              objectives of this research are to 1)  document the occurrence and source of
              saline water in the sediments  of Saginaw Bay by geochemical and isotopic
              determinations;  (2)  relate the occurrence of the saline water in the bay
              sediments to  the surrounding ground-water chemistry by comparing spatial iso- 
              chemical trends in the pore waters of the bay with that of the  ground water;
              and (3)  determine the effect of the saline water on  pore-water chemistry by
              chemical modeling.  This will be  accomplished by examining geochemical and
              isotopic characteristics  of pore water in sediments of Saginaw Bay and in
              water of the  streams in the major watershed entering the bay.  The data will
              be  studied in the context of the hydrogeochemistry of the regional as  well as
              local ground-water systems.  Results from this study will  be important in
              understanding the importance of direct ground-water  discharge to large lakes
              and the interaction of large lakes and  regional ground-water flow particularly
              that part of the flow that  involves deep saline formation water.  ***
