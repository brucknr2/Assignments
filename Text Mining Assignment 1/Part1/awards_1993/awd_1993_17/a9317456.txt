Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT    9317456  Kleinmann, S.G.    The  Two
              Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) will obtain a uniform  map  of the entire sky in
              three near-infrared bands, J (1.25  um),   H  (1.65  um)  and  K'  (2.17  um), 
              with  sufficient  sensitivity to detect point sources having K'14 mag.  at  10 
              confidence.   The  survey will penetrate  more  than  25,000  times  deeper 
              than  the  only  existing  large-scale  near-  infrared  sky survey, which was
              carried out nearly 25  years  ago  (Neugebauer  and Leighton 1969), and  will 
              enable  the  detection and accurate measurement of positions and infrared 
              brightness for nearly 100 million stars and at least 300,000  galaxies. 
              Because of its great leap in sensitivity and  sky  coverage, the scientific
              potential of this database can only  be  imagined at present.  Obvious
              applications are the study  of  the  large-scale distribution of stars in the
              Milky  Way  and  the  large-scale distribution of galaxies in the  Local 
              Universe.   More broadly, the database will enrich  analysis  of  sky  surveys 
              carried out over the whole electromagnetic  spectrum, and will vastly expand
              the scientific potential of  new infrared array technology.    The  
              implementation   of   the   p-project   involves   the  construction of two
              1.3m telescopes, one to be built at  Mt.  Hopkins  and  one  t be built at
              Cerro Tololo  Interamerican  Observatory.    The  survey is planned to begin in
              FY96, and is expected  to  take 2 years in the Southern Hemisphere and 2-3
              years in the  Northern   Hemisphere.   The  data  will   become   publicly 
              available  immediately  following checkout  by  the  science  team, within 1.5
              years after the start of survey operations.  The  final data products,
              including a Point Source  Catalog,  and  Extended  Source  database of raw 
              data  will  also  be  available to the interested user.  ***
