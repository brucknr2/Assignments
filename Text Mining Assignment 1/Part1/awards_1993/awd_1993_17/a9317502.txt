Abstract    :
              9317502  Schoener     This research continues investigations into how top
              predators (lizards) affect indirectly, via influences on middle predators
              (other insects and spiders) and herbivores, the amount of leaf damage on
              plants.  It also examines the effects of variation in rainfall on these
              dynamics.  Data are also being collected on the extinctions of populations in
              relation to population and species characteristics and presence of predators. 
              These studies will yield new insights on what controls the number of species
              that occur in given areas and how food webs respond dynamically to
              perturbation.  %%%  This research is significant in providing new insights into
              how top predators influence the population dynamics and interactions of species
              lower down in the food web and how changes in the physical environment directly
              and indirectly affect the food-web dynamics.  Information from this research
              could have important applications to understanding ecosystem response to
              climate change and to biological control and other pest management methods in
              agriculture and forestry.  ***
