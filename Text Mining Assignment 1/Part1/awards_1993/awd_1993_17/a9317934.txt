Abstract    :
              9317934  Samson       Photoionization and double photoionization studies will 
              be used to elucidate the effects of electron-electron  correlation and
              spin-orbit effects in atoms.  Of particular  interest is the recent discovery
              that Compton electrons can  produce ionization in atoms at high energies
              comparable to  the direct photoionization process.  Experimental  measurements
              to unravel the details of these processes are  important for a basic
              understanding of atomic  photoabsorption and have pragmatic implications for
              plasma  and astrophysical science.
