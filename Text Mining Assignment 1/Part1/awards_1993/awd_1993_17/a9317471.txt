Abstract    :
              9317471  Gibbs    Epicuticlar lipids serve as the primary passive barrier to
              water  loss in insects and other terrestrial arthropods. The  waterproofing
              abilities of cuticular lipids are thought to depend  upon their biophysical
              properties. According to this hypothesis,  lipid melting results in a rapid
              increase in cuticular  permeability, with subsequent death due to dehydration.
              This idea  has played an important role in the development of insect 
              physiology, but experimental support remains sketchy. Recent  technological
              advances have made it possible to test the lipid  phase transition hypothesis
              in a rigorous manner. Sensitive water  vapor sensors have allowed the accurate
              measurement of cuticular  water fluxes, and detailed biophysical studies of
              small  quantities of cuticular lipids can be performed  using Fourier 
              transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The PIs will use FTIR to  examine the
              effects of specific changes in lipid structure upon  lipid physical properties.
              The permeability of model cuticle  preparations, with lipids of known physical
              properties, will be  examined as a function of temperature. The results of
              these  experiments will be compared to those of similar studies using  isolated
              cuticle preparations. The information gained will  provide: (1) better
              understanding of the function of the  cuticular lipid waterproofing layer; and
              (2) the foundation for  physiological, ecological, and evolutionary studies of
              cuticular  lipids and water balance.  ***
