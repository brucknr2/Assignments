Abstract    :
              9319226  Paffenhofer  The long-term goal of this research is to identify,
              describe and  quantify key processes which govern the abundance, composition
              and  distribution of zooplankton in the ocean.  The main hypothesis is  that
              both signal perception, and the ability to respond to signals,  determine if a
              predator captures prey, of if the prey escapes from  the predator.  The
              objectives of this work were triggered by  ongoing studies on prey and predator
              behavior.  Aside from major  differences between species, a range from small to
              major  differences within species were observed.  Behavior observations  alone
              appear to be insufficient to comprehend a stage's range of  capabilities.  This
              work will determine the abundance and  distribution of chemo- and
              mechanosensors on the cephalic  appendages of nauplii, early copepodid stages,
              and adult females of  four species of marine planktonic copepods: and
              ontogenetic changes  in sensor types.  Data obtained in the study will further
              knowledge  on the ecological significance of predator/prey responses in marine 
              plankton.  ***
