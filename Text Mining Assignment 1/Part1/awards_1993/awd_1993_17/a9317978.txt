Abstract    :
              9317978  NEEDHAM  This award will support travel expenses for some attendees at
              the Eleventh International Congress of Acarology which will be held 17-22 July
              1994 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, OH.  Acarologists, scientists
              who study mites and ticks, from as many as 50 different countries will give
              reports on basic science in 14 symposia, 12 submitted paper sessions and a
              workshop during the six day meeting.  The very broad program will include
              presentations on research in genetics, evolution, systematics, ecology,
              physiology and molecular biology of these organisms.  A plan has been developed
              to emphasize allocation of travel funds to junior scientists, graduate students
              and researchers from other countries who might otherwise not be able to attend.
               %%%  Mites and ticks are important medically as disease vectors and parasitic
              organisms and economically for the status of many species as pests of crops and
              domestic animals.  This International Congress will provide an opportunity for
              researchers to from around the world to interact directly and to communicate
              recent research findings on many aspects of the biology of these organisms.
