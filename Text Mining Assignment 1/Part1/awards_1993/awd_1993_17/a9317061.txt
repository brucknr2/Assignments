Abstract    :
              9317061     Stevenson    There are three major components to this effort:
              continuation of  3D mantle convection simulations using a viscosity that is
              only  depth dependent; development of a variety of techniques to relate  mantle
              convection modeling to seismic tomography; and development  of calculations
              with temperature-dependent viscosity and  compositional variation to carry out
              3D (initially Cartesian)  studies of the fates of slabs, the stability of
              plumes from the  CMB, and the development of regional (non-plume) and island
              arc  volcanism in a mantle convection context.
