Abstract    :
              9317489  Walker  A Phosphorimager is a replacement for autoradiography. The
              instrument uses imaging plates that are coated with a special phosphor that
              traps and stores radiation energy. The stored energy is stable until the plate
              is scanned with a laser beam which releases the energy as luminescence. The
              luminescent signal is detected by a photomultiplier and the data are ultimately
              stored as a digital signal. Sophisticated software running on a workstation
              allows the data to be displayed, analyzed, printed and stored. The principal
              advantage of a phosphorimager over traditional autoradiography is the wide
              dynamic range and increased sensitivity. This state of the art instrument will
              make a variety of experimental analyses more sensitive and facilitate
              quantitative analysis of the data collected.   u    ~     @  ^  G +G   + P  4 ^
