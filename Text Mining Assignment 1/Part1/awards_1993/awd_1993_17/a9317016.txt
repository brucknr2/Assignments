Abstract    :
              9317016  Newell    This Americas Program award will support the   participation
              of three U.S. scientists and one  graduate student in an international workshop
              on  instabilities and nonequilibrium structures, to be  held in Santiago, Chile
              , December, 1993.  Dr. Alan  Newell, University of Arizona will be
              collaborating  with Dr. Enrique Tirapegui, University of Chile.   The purpose
              of this workshop is to present, through  courses, conferences and short
              seminars, an up-to-  date review of recent developments in the field of 
              nonlinear physics.  About 32 junior scientists and  graduate students from U.S.
              and Latin America will  attend the workshop.      The subject of the conference
              is of great interest;  the topics covered are extremely important and the 
              lecturers are of the highest international calibre.   This exposure to high
              level physics will give young  and emerging U.S. and Latin American scientists 
              valuable added professional training and the  opportunity to interact with
              eminent mathematicians  and physicists.     ***
