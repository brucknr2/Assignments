Abstract    :
              9317303  Boston       The proposal concerns the maize storage proteins  (zeins),
              that are stored within ER membranes as spherical  aggregates called protein
              bodies.  A molecular chaperon has  been isolated and characterized that
              accumulates during  kernel development and may play a critical role in the 
              ordered deposition of the proteins within protein bodies.  This molecular
              chaperon is BiP, and is a 75 kD polypeptide  that is found  within the ER and
              the protein bodies.  Although the exact role of this protein is not known, BiP 
              homologues are found in both prokayotes and eukaryotes.  The  goals of the
              proposal are to characterize the interactions  between BiP and target proteins
              during translocation to the  ER of normal and mutant endosperm;  to investigate
              the  molecular basis of altered protein body morphology in  developing
              endosperm of fl2,De-B30 and Mc mutants;  and to  determine if post
              translational modifications are correlated  with BiP function in plants.  %%% 
              The studies outlined in this proposal will increase our  knowledge of the
              processes regulating transport and  accumulation of the important storage
              reserves. They are  also essential for devising new strategies for introducing 
              new gene products to improve plant growth and quality.  ***
