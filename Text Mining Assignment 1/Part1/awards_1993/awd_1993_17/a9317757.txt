Abstract    :
              9317757  Wolszczan    This award will support a three-year program of
              investigations in which  rapidly rotating neutron stars known as radio pulsars
              will be used as tools  to address current problems in planetary system
              formation, relativistic  gravity, and globular cluster physics.  The specific
              goals are: (i)  conducting a particularly sensitive survey for millisecond
              period pulsars;  (ii) detection and dynamical studies of planetary systems
              around neutron  stars; (iii) further tests of general relativity and other
              gravity theories in  strong-field conditions using binary pulsars as probes;
              and (iv) studies of  properties of the globular cluster pulsars and using them
              as sensitive  probes of cluster dynamics.
