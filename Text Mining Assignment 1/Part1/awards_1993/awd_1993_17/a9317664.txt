Abstract    :
              9317664  Angelides  This proposal requests funds to purchase a confocal laser 
              scanning microscope.  The instrument will serve the research  needs of a number
              of faculty whose research work focuses on  the dynamics of living cells, the
              three-dimensional  arrangement of subcellular structures, and the three- 
              dimensional reconstruction of cells such as neurons in  intact brain slices. 
              Among other topics, the instrument  will be used for studies of the
              distribution of ion channels  and receptors in brain slices using fluorescent
              probes and  antibodies; the organization and dynamics of nuclear and  mitotic
              structures; the development of synapses in the  hippocampus; gene transfer
              processes; the regulation and  function of keratins in the epidermis;
              localization of  overexpressed smooth muscle caldesmon in cultured cells and 
              localization in fascin, an actin binding protein; desmin and  vimentin during
              myogenesis; and hormonal regulation of  breast cancer.
