Abstract    :
              9317572  Rohlf   The field of morphometrics is concerned with methods for
              capturing information on the size and shape of biological structures and the
              analysis of shape change and shape variation in populations.  Geometric
              morphometrics is a relatively new approach that takes into account the
              geometrical relationships among the features (positions of the landmarks and
              shapes of outlines, etcetera) rather than just measured distances or angles. 
              The proposed research is concerned with the development, evaluation and
              application of new statistical and visualization methods for geometric
              morphometrics.   The methods used will be applied to several datasets.  these
              will include: two-dimensional data on the wings of mosquitoes, 3-dimensional
              data on yellow-bellied slider and painted turtles, and data from others.  A
              large number of artificial datasets will be generated for the simulations that
              will be used to test the robustness and stability of the methods.
