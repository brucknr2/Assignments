Abstract    :
                      Carol Ehrhardt  SBR- 9317814    This exploratory investigation is a
              feasibility study of a  highly endangered monkey species, the Sanje mangabey. 
              This  is one of two rare species restricted to the Uzungwa  Mountains of
              southeastern Tanzania.  The objectives are to  a) set up transect lines for
              survey purposes, b) locate  study groups, c) assess the possibilities of
              habituation, d)  experiment with various observational methods, e) collect 
              data on morphology, vocalizations, social structure, and  feeding ecology, f)
              record vocalizations, and g) establish  ties with Tanzanian officials,
              researchers, and students.    ***
