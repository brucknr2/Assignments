Abstract    :
              9317886  Sanders  Partial funding ($391,780) is requested for the  acquisition
              of a nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an 11.7 Tesla
               magnet (1H resonance frequency of 500 MHz) for  use by multiple 
              investigators. The balance of  the cost of this instrument ($362,500) will be 
              provided by matching funds from Case Western  Reserve University and from the
              State of Ohio  Regents' ACTION fund. This machine will be  housed in the School
              of Medicine at Case  Western Reserve University (CWRU) and will be  used by a
              group of five investigators with  research interests as follows:    Charles
              Sanders, Dept. of Physiology and  Biophysics (35% proposed instrument usage): 
              Determination of the structures of membrane  proteins using oriented sample
              NMR. Michael  Zagorski, Dept. of Chemistry (25%): Structural  studies of the
              amyloid proteins. Thomas Gerken,  Dept. of Pediatrics (20%): Structural studies
               of O-linked glycopeptides. Masao Ikeda-Saito,  Dept. of Physiology and
              Biophysics (10%):  Studies of the heme sites of myeloperoxidase  and myoglobin.
               Neocles Leontis, Bowling Green  State University (10%): Structured of novel
              RNA  and DNA motifs.    The proposed instrumentation will dramatically 
              facilitate both the short and long term health  of these projects by providing
              access to a  number of spectroscopic capabilities not  currently available at
              CWRU.
