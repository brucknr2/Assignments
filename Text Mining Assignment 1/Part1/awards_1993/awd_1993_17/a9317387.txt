Abstract    :
              9317387  Wells    Theoretical and physical models as well as field studies
              suggest  that complex structural histories involving alternating contraction 
              and extension can develop within the interior of contractional  orogenic belts,
              essentially moderating crustal thickness during the  growth of the orogenic
              belt.  This project will attempt to test  these models by use of mid-crustal
              exposure of the hinterland of  Sevier Orogen in the Raft River and Grouse Creek
              Mountains of  northwestern Utah. The work will involve structural mapping, 
              Metamorphic thermobarometry, P-T-t path modeling, and several  geochronologic
              techniques.  This study will address several  components of the deformation
              history of the area and test several  existing models for middle crustal
              evolution during Mesozoic  regional contraction and post-orogenic extension. 
              It will also  help link the possible coeval deformations between the hinterland
               and the foreland thrust belt.  ***
