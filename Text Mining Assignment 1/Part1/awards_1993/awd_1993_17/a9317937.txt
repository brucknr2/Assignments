Abstract    :
              9317937  Bifano       The award is for investigating issues in the manufacture
              of  massively parallel, microelectromechanical systems by using  semiconductor
              fabrication technology.  Arrays of electrostatically  actuated diaphragms have
              been manufactured by such a process, and  will be evaluated for actuator
              mechanical characteristics and  process yield.  The production of optical
              quality surfaces on such  multi actuator wafers by precision diamond grinding
              will also be  investigated, as the initial application to be investigated is 
              adaptive optical compensation of telescopes.         Successful completion of
              the research would enable precise,  fine, distributed actuation which would
              benefit a variety of  applications.  Examples of such applications are a multi
              zone  deformable mirror to be used for adaptive optical compensation of 
              telescopes, and multi gate flow control valve for precise control  of very low
              liquid flow rates in semiconductor, biomedical and  chemical applications.
