              Experimental and Numerical Modeling of Czochralski Silicon Crystal Growth  This
              award will enable Vicki Booker, a Ph.D. graduate student at the University of
              Pennsylvania, to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Koichi Kakimoto for
              six months at the Fundamental Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation, in
              Tsukuba, Japan.  By experimentally growing silicon crystals under different
              conditions, the team will test the accuracy of numerical models developed by
              Ms. Booker for silicon crystal growth.  As the basis of most electronic
              devices, silicon based semiconductors are essential to the consumer
              electronics, telecommunications, and computer industries.  A high quality
              silicon substrate is crucial for further advancement and refinement of small
              scale electronic devices.  In order to produce the necessary high quality
              single silicon crystals, the primary technique for growing these crystals, the
              Czochralski (CZ) method, must be better understood.  Ms. Booker has developed
              numerical models to describe the bulk fluid motion in the CZ system and the
              effect of this motion on the growing crystal, however, the accuracy of this
              model is verifiable only through the use of experimental data.  By working with
              Dr. Kakimoto, Ms. Booker will utilize Dr. Kakimoto's technique for directly
              observing bulk fluid motion in melting silicon and provide numerical simulation
              to aid in the analysis of the e xperimental results.   An experimentally
              verified model for the Czochralski crystal growth system will benefit not only
              the semiconductor industry, but also a wide range of materials development
              efforts which are based on single crystal growth.
