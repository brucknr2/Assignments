Abstract    :
                       Biologists at the City College of New York are  requesting matching
              funds to up-           gradeand provide new optical facilities for their 
              research. Requested are funds to           purchase: 1) a transmission electron
              microscope  (TEM); 2) an inverted epifluorescent           microscope; and 3) a
              confocal laser scanning  microscope. We also wish to upgrade the          
              stage of a constantly used digital scanning  electron microscope (DSEM).The new
                        TEM will replace the present TEM, a Phillips 300  purchased 21 years
              ago, which has           limited value as a research instrument because it  is
              not capable of producing images           required to answer many contemporary
              research  questions. At present we have strong           need for an inverted
              epifluorescent microscope and  a confocal laser scanning           microscope.
              The present stage on our Zeiss digital  scanning microscope is a bottle        
                neck for effective use of this instrument. The  present stage takes only one
              specimen at           a time; we must pump down between specimen changes.  The
              new stage holds 5 stubs           (specimen holders) at a time. It also is
              automated  and digitized. This will allow           researchers to make
              montages. It will also give  researchers, studying small organisms          
              and cells, the ability to mark positions of  specimens of interest by storage
              in memory           so that the best specimens can be relocated,  studied, and
              photographed.             The research aided by the new equipment is quite 
              broad in aspect, covering fields such           as Neurobiology, Molecular
              Developmental Genetics,  Immunobiology, Protistology,           Molecular
              Systematics, Endocytobiology, and  Evolution. More specifically the          
              following projects will be aided: 1) Phagosome-  phagolysosomal processing in
              diatom-           bearing endosymbioses in foraminifera;  2)Karyokinesis and
              systematics of           foraminifera; 3) Molecular systematics of  planktonic
              diatoms; 4) Ce ll surface           phenotypes of thymic nurse cells; 5)
              Contact  between thymocytes and thymic nurse           cells; 6) Molecular and
              genetic analysis of the  Drosophila compound eye; 8)           Molecular
              mechanisms underlying axonal development  and connection specificity in        
                the embryonic and metamorphosing nervous system of  the frog Xenopus Iclevis;
              and           9) Studies of growth factors and neurotransmitters  involved in
              the signal cascade by           means of which the retina modulates growth of
              the  sclera which, when awry, can           lead to myopia.             The
              City College is located in theHarlem section of  New York City.and its student 
                       body is predominantly minority. Many students are  involved with the
              proposed           investigators in undergraduate and graduate  research.
              Should this proposal be funded,           there is every expectation that
              minority students  will be involved in the research itself,           and the
              fallout which enters other aspects of  coursework and training.
