              long distance pollen movement (i.e. gene flow) are important processes that are
              responsible for introducing and maintaining genetic diversity within plant
              populations.  In the proposed study, I will examine pollen dispersal, gene
              flow, and effective hybridization between two common North American milkweeds
              (Poke Milkweed,    Asclepias       exaltata    L.; Common Milkweed,   
              Asclepias       syriaca    L.).  These species occur in the same areas and
              overlap in flowering time, share pollinators, form viable hybrids, maintain
              high levels of genetic variation, and possess several unique genetic markers. 
              Together these features make them ideal candidates for examining gene flow and
              hybridization.  Nevertheless,    A   .    exaltata    and    A   .    syriaca  
               differ in several reproductive features (e.g., asexual reproduction,
              investment in pollen producing structures, and inflorescence size) which
              permits us to examine the effects of these life history traits on gene flow and
              hybridization.  Specifically, gene flow and hybridization will be quantified by
              identifying pollen parents of seed to examine (1) pollen dispersal, (2) levels
              of long distance pollen mediated gene flow, and (3) effective hybridization
              between these species.          The results of this study will contribute to
              our understanding of gene flow and hybridization in the maintenance of genetic
              diversity in plant populations.  These processes are important to study because
              genetic var iation provides the necessary material for adaptation and long term
              species conservation.  I will examine the underlying pollination mechanisms and
              plant pollinator interactions that directly affect these evolutionary
              processes.  In addition, this study should lay the foundation for more
              comprehensive studies on the processes and evolutionary consequences of long
              distance pollen dispersal and hybridization in natural populations.
