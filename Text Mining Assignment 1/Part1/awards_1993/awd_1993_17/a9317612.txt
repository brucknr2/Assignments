Abstract    :
              9317612  Wu    Measurements of Photoabsorption Cross Sections of Solar System
              and  Cosmic Gases Under In-Situ Conditions.    Dr. Wu and his collaborators
              have successfully performed laboratory  measurements of high resolution, low-
              and room-temperatuare  photoabsorption cross sections of several molecules
              present in Solar System  and cosmic gases.  They will contine this research by
              applying it to the  measurement of the cross sections of the 4PG system,
              Cameron bands, the  underlying forbidden transitions and the pseudo-continuum
              of CO and to the  cross sections of ammonia and several important hydrocarbons
              including  Allene, Methyl Acetylene, Methyl Ethylene, Cyclopropane,
              Diacetylene, and  Triacetylene, from their respective absorption thresholds to
              1060  Angstroms.  The pressure effects of perturbers such as molecular hydrogen
               and nitrogen on the aborbers of interest will be studied under conditions 
              similar to those found in realistic planetary atmospheres.
