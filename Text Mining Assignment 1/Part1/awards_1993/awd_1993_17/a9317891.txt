Abstract    :
              The prototype of a VLSI multichannel preamiplifier system  for recording and
              stimulating neural; activity has been  developed at Southern Methodist
              University as proposed in a  two-year grant.  A three-year follow-on-grant is
              proposed to  enable sufficient testing and modification for recreation of  the
              robust proven system necessary for a production model  that could function in
              the laboratories of the neuroscience  community at large.    The objectives are
              1) to eliminate problems in the prototype  that might occur when it is used
              with neural systems; 2) to  provide features of control, programming,
              record-keeping,  electrode-characteristics, and neural-network- 
              characteristics sampling, and convenience essential to the  management of the
              collection of data form large neural  arrays; 3) to provide an improved planar
              multielectrode  array.    The objectives will be obtain 1) by regular and
              systematic  testing in the Center for Network Neuroscience at the  University
              of North Texas and also at other selected  laboratories as possible; 2) by
              re-design and/or  modification of the VLSI chip and associated hardware as 
              necessary; and 3) by continued experimentation with  materials and methods to
              produce the desired improved  electrode array.    Production of the system will
              greatly simplify the task of  obtaining the information from large numbers of
              electrodes  needed for the study of living neural networks.
