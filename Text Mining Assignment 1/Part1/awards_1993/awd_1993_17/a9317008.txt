              Program award will support a research collaboration between Dr. Stanley  N.
              Williams, Arizona State University and Dr. Claudio Gutierrez, Nicaraguan
              Institute of Earth Sciences.  The main objective of the research is to
              determine whether Cerro Negro volcano, located in western Nicaragua, is an
              unusually long lived cinder cone or the early stage in the development of a
              stratovolcano.  Mapping and stratigraphic studies will seek to document the
              history of the system as the basis for detailed mineralogical, chemical, and
              isotopic studies of the products. Ancillary goals of the research would be to
              characterize the volcano and its present state of activity and establish a
              baseline against which future changes in activity can be analyzed.  The work 
              will include geological, geochemical and geophysical studies of the evolution
              and current activity of the volcano.  A map of potential hazards likely to be
              associated with  future eruptions will be prepared.  Cerro Negro is one of the
              most active and fastest growing volcanoes in Central America. The area around
              it is the second largest population center in Nicaragua and of particular
              economic importance as a productive farming area. The volcano is a threat to
              the population and to the economy of the country and monitoring its activity
              and characterizing the significant hazards posed by it will be of positive
              benefit to the region.   The Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Sciences will
              collaborate fully with the research and the transfer of methodology and ideas
              resulting from this study will provide them with the necessary tools to
              undertake similar studies of the many other active and threatening volcanoes
              within their country. ***
