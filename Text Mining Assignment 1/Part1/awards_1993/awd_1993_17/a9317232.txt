Abstract    :
              9317232  Steckler       Although tectonic models are useful in the study of 
              continental deformation, the outcome of many are strongly dependent  on the
              choice of input valves.  This project will attempt to  develop a method to
              predict which valve of the flexural rigidity of  continental lithosphere to use
              in various situations.  The model  will involve the use of a finite element
              routine incorporating  rheologic modeling through the yield strength envelopes
              and will be  tested or calibrated from existing examples.  Results should 
              improve the choice of flexural rigidity used in future tectonic  models.
