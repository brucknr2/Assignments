Abstract    :
              9317038  Tullis      The PIs will perform experiments to determine the physical
              processes responsible for the frictional behavior observed in the laboratory. 
              The experiments will measure frictional behavior with and without the presence
              of fault gouge and develop process-based constitutive laws.  Such laws are
              required for extrapolation from the laboratory to the Earth because of the
              large differences in time and length scales.  ****
