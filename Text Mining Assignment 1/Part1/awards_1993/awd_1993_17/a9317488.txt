Abstract    :
                      9317488  Pelto    This project involves the dissertation research of  a
              cultural anthropologist from the University of  Connecticut.  The student will
              study changing  beliefs about reproduction and sexual behavior  among young men
              and women in Senegal, West Africa.  It will examine how changes in wage labor, 
              migration and education patterns affect  reproduction-related strategies. Using
               ethnographic research methods of intensive  interviews, surveys and
              focus-group interviews in  Dakar, the capital city, and in a rural village, 
              the student will try to understand how young  people conceptualize their sexual
              behavior and its  relation to STDs.   This research is important because AIDS
              and other  STDs are a major public health issue all over the  world, and
              particularly in Africa.  Advances in  our understanding of how young people
              think about  their sexual behavior can help public health  officials deal with
              the problem.  ***
