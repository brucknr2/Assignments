Abstract    :
              9317181  Harbor       Geomorphic response to extensional uplift is a matter of 
              concern to the geomorphologist, geophysicist, and sedimentologist,  but has
              received little quantitative study.  The area south of  Yellowstone in the
              transition between the Basin and Range and  Middle Rocky Mountains of Wyoming
              is dotted by extensional uplifts  that exhibit a varying degree of structural
              offset and erosional  dissection.  the types of geomorphic processes and rates
              of erosion  in several of these ranges will be studied in order to provide new 
              data on redistribution of mass in the presence of major tectonic  relief.  The
              field area will also be numerically described in terms  of relief and the
              dimensions/characteristics of drainage basins and  stream segments, in part
              from DEM models of topography.  Selected  areas within these mountainous
              uplifts will also be mapped  according to geomorphic process and studied in
              detail for rate of  erosion.  Using deposits that have accumulated on datable
              surfaces  and incision or aggradation of streams over the last 103 to 104 
              years, the rate of processes on "competing" geomorphic components  of mountain
              uplifts will be quantified.  Deposits slated for study  include pluvial lake
              deltas, debris fans, and valley fills behind  landslide dams and moraines.  All
              of these data will be used  together to discover, if possible, the important
              predictors of  denudation rate, such as relief or drainage area.  Conceptual 
              models of geomorphic processes will be evaluated against these data  and also
              against descriptions of processes.  Of particular interest  is the change in
              rate of drainage basin erosion with time and  increasing offset.
