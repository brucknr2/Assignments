              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9312760  P.I.:  Rubner  Institution:  M.I.T.  
               The primary objective of this research is to develop the chemistry and
              nanoscale processing techniques needed to control the molecular and
              supermolecular organizations of electroactive conjugated polymers.  This work
              is driven by the notion that the unique optical and electrical properties of
              these fascinating materials can be successfully tailored at the molecular level
              if suitable techniques are developed to manipulate and control the manner in
              which they organize in the solid state.  To accomplish this goal, two new
              layer-by-layer molecular self-assembly processes recently discovered in our
              laboratory will be investigated; the self-assembly of conjugated polyions and
              the self-assembly of the p-type doped conducting polymers.  The ability to
              readily fabricate multilayer thin films of conjugated polymers via molecular
              self-assembly processes is expected to open up completely new vistas with
              regard to the thin film processing of conducting polymers and related
              electoactive materials.  In addition, self-assembled films can be used to
              fabricated and examine new heterostructure based thin film devices and sensors
              and to tailor the electrical and optical properties of various surfaces at the
              molecular level.  The multilayer and heterostructure thin films fabricated with
              these new techniques will be characterized and evaluated in the form of various
              technologically relevant thin film devices such as thin film capacitors and
              Schottky light emitting diodes.
