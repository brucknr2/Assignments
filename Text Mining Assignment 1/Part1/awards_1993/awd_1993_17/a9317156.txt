Abstract    :
              9317156  Bloxham       This award provides one-half of the funds required to
              purchase  computing equipment to be installed and operated in the Department 
              of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. Harvard is  committed to
              providing the remaining funds necessary to acquire the  equipment. The computer
              will be used primarily to serve the  research needs of the department's
              geophysics group whose projects  include numerical modeling of the Earth's
              geodynamo, theoretical  calculations of magnetohydrodynamics, and
              interpretations of the  Earth's geomagnetic field.  ***
