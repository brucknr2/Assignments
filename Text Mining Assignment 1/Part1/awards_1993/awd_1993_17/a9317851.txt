Abstract    :
                  9317851  Galambos  The Structural Stability Research Council (SSRC) has
              published four  editions of its "Guide" (1960, 1966, 1976, and 1988) and its 
              Executive Committee has authorized the preparation of the fifth  edition for
              publication in 1996.  The various parts of the new  "Guide" are currently
              (1993) being written by the Task Groups of  the Council.  The principal
              investigator has been appointed by SSRC  to be the editor of the fifth edition.
               This will involve a)  working with the SSRC Task Groups to assist them in the
              preparation  of the first draft of each chapter, b) managing the review process
               for each chapter, c) editing each chapter to achieve uniformity of  coverage
              and style, d) performing the tasks involved in assembling   and editing a major
              book and e) performing the editorial jobs in  the interface between author and
              publishers (proofs, galleys,  etc.).  No funds are requested for writing or for
              publishing the  "Guide."
