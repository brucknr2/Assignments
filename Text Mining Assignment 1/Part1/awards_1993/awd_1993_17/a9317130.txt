Abstract    :
              9317130  Molina       It has long been known that paleozoic trends are truncated
               along the southwest continental margin of the United States and  correlation
              of Paleozoic miogeoclinal strata in northwestern Sonora  with similar rocks in
              the Death Valley area has been interpreted to  indicate 800 km of sinistral
              motion on a "Mojave-Sonora Megashear".  However, this interpreted structure has
              not been verified in the  field, and remains controversial.  This proposal will
              employ  paleomagnetic techniques to attempt to confirm the postulated  offset
              along the proposal structure.  As the latitudinal component  of the offset is
              at or near the resolving power of the method, this  project is focused on
              determining the level of precision and  consistency of the paleomagnetic signal
              in this area.  A successful  outcome will help justify use of this method to
              resolve the Mojave-  Sonora Megashear controversy.
