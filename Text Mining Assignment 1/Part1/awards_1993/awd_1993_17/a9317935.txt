Abstract    :
              9317935  Callahan    The ocean technologies have significant economic and
              scientific  impact on our nation.  A planning grant to the University of Rhode 
              Island (EEC-9222523) has helped generate sufficient industrial  support to meet
              the criteria required to form an  Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Ocean  Technologies.    The Center's research agenda will focus on
              environmental monitoring  systems, equipment testing and acoustics and ocean
              mapping.      The Principal Investigator and colleagues are internationally 
              recognized scientists who have the resources and capability to run  this
              Center.    This Center has been coordinated with Norman Caplan, Program 
              Manager, Ocean Engineering Systems, Division of Biological and  Critical
              Systems at NSF.    Additional funding is provided by the U.S. Department of
              Navy to  augment ongoing research and to obtain a membership in the Center.   
              The Program Manager recommends the University of Rhode Island be  awarded
              $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.    An additional
              $25,000 is recommended for one year with funds  provided by the U.S. Department
              of Navy.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or 
              the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will
              review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria
              requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the
              university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the
              support base is developing and 3) the extent to  which a robust research
              program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager
              will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
