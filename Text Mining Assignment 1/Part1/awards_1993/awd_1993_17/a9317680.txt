Abstract    :
              9317680  Babcock    This research program explores the ways in which grain
              boundary  segregated elements affect the atomic structure of grain boundaries 
              in metals and oxides.  Characterization techniques include high  resolution,
              phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  imaging, high resolution
              Z-contrast scanning TEM imaging, high  spatial resolution x-ray and electron
              energy loss spectroscopy, and  high speed position-sensitive atom probe
              microscopy to determine:   (a) the atomic-scale distribution of the segregated
              solute both  parallel and perpendicular to the grain boundary, and (b) the 
              influence of the segregated solute on the atomic packing units of  the host
              grain boundary.  These studies are conducted on  bicrystalline samples of
              controlled grain boundary crystallography,  controlled doping, and simple, but
              representative, geometry.  Lead-  doped nickel oxide and gold-doped iron have
              been chosen for the  initial experiments.  These two alloy systems are model
              materials  whose behavior represent that of a broad range of compounds and 
              alloys.  The experimental results will be compared with  contemporary models
              for grain boundary structure.  The thrust of  these analyses is to determine
              whether or not a fundamental  structural mechanism exists by which segregated
              atoms influence  grain boundary properties.    %%%  Such knowledge is
              fundamental to understanding the mechanisms by  which grain boundary segregated
              solutes control a broad range of  grain boundary and, therefore, bulk
              properties in engineering  materials.  ***
