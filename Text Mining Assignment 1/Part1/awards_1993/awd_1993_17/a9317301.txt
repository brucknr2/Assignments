Abstract    :
              9317301  Prasanna  Future parallel processing systems will consist of diverse
              high  performance computers integrated to form a Heterogeneous  Computing
              Network that allows them to cooperate in solving  complex scientific and
              engineering problems.   Each machine  connected to the network may be suitable
              for a different class of  parallel computations.  Such an organization will
              exploit the  current advances in parallel hardware architectures, 
              interconnection technologies, and programming paradigms to  provide a
              cost-effective environment for high performance  parallel computing.   
              Efficient utilization of such an environment depends on a number  of issues to
              be addressed including techniques to partition  application tasks and map the
              subtasks onto various machines in  the network.  This research addresses
              several key issues in using  a heterogeneous computing environment.  The work
              will focus on  modeling the Heterogeneous Computing paradigm for algorithm 
              development,  addressing the computational issues involved in  using such a
              paradigm, design of partitioning and mapping  strategies, and integrating these
              strategies into existing  programming systems to solve computationally
              demanding problems  in image understanding.  ***
