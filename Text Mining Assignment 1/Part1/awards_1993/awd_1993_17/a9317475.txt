Abstract    :
              9317475  Pancella        An experimental program, using particle beams  produced
              in the electron-cooled storage ring and  synchroton (Cooler) now operating at
              the Indiana  University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) will be carried  out.  These
              scattering experiments will be performed in  collaboration with scientists at
              IUCF and elsewhere.  Experiments include pion production near threshold in 
              few-nucleon systems, and studies of spin dependence  using polarized beams and
              targets.  The pion is known  to mediate the strong force between nucleons, and
              this  force shows an interesting dependence on spin degrees  of freedom.  The
              data provided by these experiments, in  conjunction with theoretical models for
              interpretation,  will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the 
              strong interaction which forms nuclei.  ***
