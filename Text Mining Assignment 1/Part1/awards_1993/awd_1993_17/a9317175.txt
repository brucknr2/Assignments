Abstract    :
              Abstract  Fink  This proposal will identify the specific genes involved in
              pathway  of IAA biosynthesis, the tissue specificity of these genes, the 
              phenotypes of mutations that prevent expression, and regulatory  mutations
              affecting the pathway.  The plant hormone, indole acetic  acid (IAA) has
              remarkably diverse effects on plant growth and  morphogenesis (22) (e.g. apical
              dominance, cell division, cell  enlargement and lateral root formation).  Our
              belief is that once  the gene(s) specifically involved in IAA biosynthesis are
              cloned,  the role of internal IAA in each of these processes can be 
              understood.  As most of the structural genes in the pathway are  found in
              multiple copies, mutations will be sought in each member  of a set so that the
              role of gene redundancy in the tryptophan/IAA  pathway can be determined.  To
              achieve this goal experiments are  designed to improve transformation, gene
              targeting, and the control  of gene expression by antisense.  %%%   Indole
              acetic acid is a plant hormone which affects many growth and  morphogenic
              characteristics of plants. Most of what is known have  been determined by
              external application of IAA to plants. However,  little is known about its
              synthesis and function in an in vivo  situation. The aromatic amino acid
              pathway is utilized for the  biosynthesis of IAA and we will identify and clone
              the genes  encoding the enzymes of this pathway, determine gene copy number 
              and attempt to gain insight into the internal functioning of the  hormone. We
              will, as necessary, develop the technology needed to  achieve these goals.  ***
