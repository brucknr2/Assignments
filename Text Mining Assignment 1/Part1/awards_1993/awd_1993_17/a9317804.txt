Abstract    :
              9317804  Grujicic     The mechanism and the potential for transformation
              toughening of  gamma titanium aluminide (TiAl) by the introduction of a
              metastable  titanium-aluminum-vanadium-iron (Al-Ti-V-Fe) beta phase dispersion 
              are investigated by (a) experimental characterization and numerical  modeling
              of materials constitutive relations, and (b) fracture  toughness measurements
              and detailed observations of martensitic  transformation in the vicinity of the
              crack tip.  Three types of  gamma TiAl base-alloys containing a dispersion of
              beta phase with  different thermodynamic stabilities have been designed using a
               thermodynamic-based procedure.  Quantitative constitutive relations  that are
              based on stress-assisted and strain-induced transformation  kinetics for gamma
              TiAl plus beta Ti-Al-V-Fe systems are to be  developed.  These relations are
              then used in a finite element  analysis to study the interaction of a moving
              crack in the gamma  TiAl  matrix with beta phase particles and grain boundary 
              microcracks.  %%%  This research represents a new approach to toughening of
              gamma  titanium alloys.  The results could serve as a basis for improved 
              toughness in high temperature titanium alloys.  ***
