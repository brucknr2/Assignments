Abstract    :
              9317599  Lewellen       Tornadoes are among the most powerful of natural
              disasters.   Over several years of research, general characteristics of the 
              dynamics of tornado vortices have been described and many aspects  of their
              parent storms have been defined.  Nonetheless, some basic  questions still
              remain as to the nature of the flow within tornadic  vortices and what factors
              control their structure.       The Principal Investigator proposes to further
              knowledge of  tornadoes using an advanced numerical model and observational 
              information.  The type of numerical model to be used is called a  large eddy
              simulation model (LES) and marks the first time this  technology has been
              applied to the study of tornadic vortices.  The  major advantage of this model
              is that its high resolution allows  the resolution of enough of large turbulent
              eddies to that sub-grid  parameterizations of turbulent transport is not nearly
              as critical  as it is in lower resolution simulations.  Model boundary 
              conditions will be determined from available field data and  numerical
              simulations of thunderstorms.         It is anticipated that the project will
              result in better  definition of the distinctive features of the turbulent wind
              field  associated with tornadoes.  It should permit the answers to such 
              questions as: (1) how is the probability of reaching a given  extreme speed at
              a given height related to values of convergence  and vorticity averaged over
              this tornado vortex domain; (2) what is  the sensitivity of the tornado wind
              field to various boundary  conditions; (3) what sub-grid parameterizations for
              this type flow  provide the proper interactions for simulations over larger
              domains  with lower resolution?   ***
