Abstract    :
              9317401  Peterson    In order to evaluate two classes of food chain models
              (top-down and bottom-up regulation of species abundance), this project includes
              continued evaluation of moose and wolf population dynamics in Isle Royale
              National Park, Michigan, an island in Lake Superior (544 km2 in area).  Also
              included is expanded monitoring of moose condition and vegetation status.  The
              two food chain model classes have opposing predictions for two trophic
              subsystems which are evident on Isle Royale.  These subsystems, attributable to
              differences in postglacial history, differ in forage production rate for moose,
              a fact that allows greater discrimination between contrasting predictions of 
              food chain theories.  Food chain models also have opposing predictions
              following the transformation of a three-trophic-level system into a
              two-trophic-level system, a change now predicted for Isle Royale because of
              genetic deterioration in its small wolf population.  The research includes
              long-term aerial and ground monitoring of wolves, moose, and vegetation,
              recognizing the two trophic subsystems, through the expected period of wolf
              decline (about one decade).    The proposed study, building on an unprecedented
              database covering the past 35 years, will provide a critical terrestrial test
              of predictions of food chain models, as well as contribute to a better
              understanding of the regulatory role of wolves in this well-characterized
              ecosystem.
