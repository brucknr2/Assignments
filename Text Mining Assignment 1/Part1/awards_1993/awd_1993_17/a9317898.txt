Abstract    :
              9317898  Zuiderweg This proposal is a request for funds to purchase a  new
              radio-frequency console, probes and accessories for an  existing older 500 MHz
              NMR spectrometer. The upgraded  system, which is actually on loan at the
              University of  Michigan now, provides state-of-the-art multi-dimensional 
              multi-nuclear magnetic resonance support for research  supported faculty in the
              Biophysics Research Division and  the Department of Biological Chemistry at the
              University of  Michigan. The faculty involved is generally researching 
              biological systems of molecular size exceeding 15 kDa.  Because of this size,
              NMR support for their research will  exclusively rely on advanced and
              time-consuming experiments  in two, three and four dimensions involving up to
              four  nuclei simultaneously with isotopically enriched materials, 
              necessitating the upgrade. The purchase of the upgraded  instrument will
              immediately benefit the research of seven  faculty who hold a total of 16
              active federally-sponsored  research grants, one institutional training grant
              and two  pending grants.       Specific projects are:       NMR structure
              determination of stromelysin catalytic  domain       NMR studies of Yersinia
              Phosphatase in Solution       Determination of a high-resolution solution
              structure of  T4-lysozyme by     Multi-dimensional NMR       NMR studies of the
              structures of catalytic RNA subdomains       Studies of the interaction of a2
              adrenergic receptor  peptides with G-protein     subtypes       Electron
              Transfer and conformational gating in  Flavodoxins: NMR analysis of     E. coli
              Flavodoxin       Methodology development in multi-nuclear multi-  dimensional
