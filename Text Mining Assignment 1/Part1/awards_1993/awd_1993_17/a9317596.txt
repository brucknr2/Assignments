Abstract    :
                    9317596  Burns         New X-ray, optical, and now radio observations have
               demonstrated that clusters of galaxies are not simple related  structures as
              once envisioned, but rather dynamically evolving  systems that have undergone
              dramatic cluster/subcluster merging.   This research will support a
              multiwavelength observational study of  clusters and cluster merging coupled
              with sophisticated  hydrodynamical and N-body numerical modelling, centered
              around  radio galaxies in clusters.  It will investigate how mergers  influence
              the creation and evolution of wide-angle tailed radio  sources, cluster radio
              halos, and steep-spectrum radio galaxies.   Numerical hydro/N-body simulations
              will be used to explore the  evolution of the gravitational potential well and
              the gas in  clusters during merging.  Magnetohydrodynamic simulations will be 
              used to model the cluster gaseous environment including  nonspherical cooling
              inflows and thermal instabilities, and the  propagation of radio jets through
              cluster atmospheres.
