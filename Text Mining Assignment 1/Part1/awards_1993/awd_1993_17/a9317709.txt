Abstract    :
              9317709  Sundaresan    It was proposed to provide partial support to 12
              professors and   students from U. S. to participate at the Fourth International
               Conference on Circulating Fluid Beds, which will be held in  Somerset, PA,
              during august 1-5, 1993.  The meeting will bring  together researchers from
              universities and  industry, almost in  equal number.  The exposure of
              university researchers to operating  experiences, industrial research needs,
              new applications and system  configurations is particularly useful because of
              the large gap  currently existing between applications and theory.  The peer 
              reviewed proceedings will be distributed to the scientific and  industrial
              community working in the field of circulating fluid  beds. The participants (4
              professors and 8 graduate students) to be  partially supported from the NSF
              award are leading researchers or  do research in leading research groups.  The
              exposure of eight   graduate students to industrial issues and international
              community  will be beneficial to their training and future carrier.  ***
