Abstract    :
              9317062  Hoopes       Although it is known that the concentration of the general
               transcription factors are important to gene expression in vivo,  very little
              is known about the expression of the yeast SUA7 gene,  which codes for the
              TFIIB protein of yeast.  Using gene fusions  and primer extension assays to
              assess promoter activity, we will  examine the regulation of SUA7 under a
              variety of conditions.   This study promises to provide interesting information
              both on  eukaryotic promoter structure and on the effect of the general 
              transcription factors on promoter activity.  %%%  Cellular regulation often
              involves the control of RNA synthesis  from the DNA template.  This type of
              regulation is essential to  maintaining the normal cell state, and
              understanding gene  regulation is important to advances in both medical science
              and  biotechnology.  Although we know much about the signals in the  DNA that
              control gene expression, we know less about the  regulation of the expression
              of the molecules (transcription  factors) that interact with the DNA.  Using
              yeast as an  experimental system, I propose to examine the regulation of a 
              particular transcription factor required for gene expression.   This research
              will contribute to our understanding of mechanisms  of gene regulation in
              higher organisms.  ***
