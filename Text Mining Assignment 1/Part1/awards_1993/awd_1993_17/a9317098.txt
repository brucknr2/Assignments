Abstract    :
                9312847  Zhang    This award supports cooperative work with Chinese scientists
              at  Shandong Teacher's University, Jinan, China on quantum dynamics  of
              polyatomic molecules.  The U.S. principal investigator, John  Zhang of New York
              University, will work with NYU graduate  students on a two year collaboration
              with the Atomic and  Molecular Physics Group at Shandong Teacher's College.    
              Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that control intra-and  intermolecular
              energy transfer and energy partitioning among the  products of unimolecular
              reactions is of practical importance in  chemical dynamics.  As studies of
              unimolecular reaction move ever  closer toward state to state level thanks to
              advances in laser  and molecular beam technologies, it is increasingly
              important and  necessary to use dynamical theories to simulate unimolecular 
              processes in order to understand the detailed dynamics and  features of the
              potential energy surfaces that characterize  unimolecular reactions.  In this
              proposal, the researchers will  focus on rigorous quantum mechanical study for
              vibrational  predissociation of HF dimer and other hydrogen bonded complexes 
              and the direct photodissociation of hydrogen peroxide.
