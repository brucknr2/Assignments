Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to search for hydrothermal vents in  the
              Bransfield Straits region of the Antarctic Peninsula.  This  region contains a
              rift which has formed on thinned continental  crust. Hydrothermal vents thought
              to be associated with this rift  contribute to heat and mass fluxes in this
              region of the ocean and  may host unusual communities of organisms.  The vent
              survey will be  accomplished by towing an instrument package called the ZAPS
              sled  near the bottom, approximately 2 kilometers deep.  The instruments  on
              the sled measure metal content of the sea water and other  parameters that
              allow detection of plumes from hydrothermal vents.   When indications of a
              plume are detected, the survey is altered to  follow the plume back to its
              source.  In this fashion, vents should  be located and a general map of
              hydrothermal emanations from the  rift will be constructed.  When combined with
              the swath bathymetry,  a sub-sea topographic map with hydrothermal vents
              location will be  produced.  This information will be used for assessing the 
              contribution of the Bransfield Strait rift to global heat and mass  fluxes
              associated with spreading ridges and will be important to  assessing the
              potential for future research associated with vent  biota at high latitudes.
