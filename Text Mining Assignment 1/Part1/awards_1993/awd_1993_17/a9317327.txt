Abstract    :
                                                                                         
              9317327  ASHLEY  Advanced petrological and geochemical analysis of stone
              artifacts  provides  a  unique  opportunity for  resolving  questions  about 
              prehistoric societies, including migration and trading routes  by  the earliest
              Americans. This dissertation research will focus  on  the  study  of  chert 
              outcrops  and  the  correlation  of  their  petrological  and  geochemical
              signatures  with  those  of  chert  artifacts  from  prehistoric  sites  in 
              northwest  Alaska.   The  petrological correlation will be made using
              microscopy,  electron  microprobe   analysis  of  mineral  inclusions  and  
              microfossil  identification.  The geochemical correlation  will  be  based  on 
              statistical  results  of  neutron activation  analysis  of  trace  elements.
