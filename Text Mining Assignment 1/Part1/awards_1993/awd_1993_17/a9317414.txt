Abstract    :
              9317414  Herrick  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and 
              Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at  the University
              of Oregon-Eugene in the purchase of an upgrade  of its existing x-ray
              diffractometer.  This equipment upgrade  will enhance research in a number of
              areas.  Among these  projects are those which describe structural studies of
              organic  molecules of biological relevance, inorganic complexes  pertinent as
              models for magnetic materials and catalysts, and  solid state inorganic
              materials of technological interest.  In  addition to serving researchers
              within the Chemistry  Department, an upgraded instrument will enjoy increased
              use by  the entire regional science community.  %%%  The x-ray diffractometer
              is used to make accurate and precise  measurements of the full
              three-dimensional structure of a  molecule.  The information obtained gives the
              precise values of  all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule
              and  it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of  that
              molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.  ***
