Abstract    :
              9317976  Hartnett     This research continues investigations into how 
              mycorrhizal symbioses mediate exchange of nutrients among plants and thereby
              influence the structure and dynamics of plant communities.  A combination of
              field studies and greenhouse experiments examines the mechanisms controlling
              patterns of nutrient transfer between plants via mycorrhizal hyphal bridges and
              the influence of mycorrhyzae on competition among plants and on plant response
              to grazing.  The influence of grazing pressure on the activity of mycorrhizal
              fungi is also examined.  %%%  This research is significant in providing new
              insights into the role played by associations between mycorrhizal fungi and
              plants in the competition for resources among plant species and interactions
              between plants and herbivores.  The function and structure of communities may
              be more strongly influenced by mycorrhizal mutualisms than has been previously
              thought.  Information from this research could have important applications to
              understanding ecosystem function, mineral nutrition of trees and agricultural
              plants, and the effect of weeds on cultivated plants.  ***
