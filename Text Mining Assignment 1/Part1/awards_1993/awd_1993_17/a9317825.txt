Abstract    :
              9317825  Wangemann  This proposal requests partial support for travel funds for
              young faculty and graduate students to attend the topical meeting on Optical
              -Microwave Interactions, to be held in Santa Barbara, CA July 19-21, 1993,
              under a sponsorship of the IEEE Lasers and Electro Optics Society.  The meeting
              will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of fundamental scientific
              and engineering advances in the interaction between optical techniques and
              microwave/millimeter wave applications.  The discussions will focus on several
              broad areas:  (1) the use of ultrashort-pulse lasers and high-speed
              optoelectronics for the control and characterization of devices, circuits and
              interconnects; (2) microwave signal generation and distribution with cw lasers
              and optical modulators; and (3) generation of ultrashort electromagnetic
              transients and their applications.  ***         scotco" " " " " " " " " " " " "
