Abstract    :
              Lively  9317924       The purpose of this study is to evaluate some of the
              critical  assumptions of the recently developed parasite hypothesis for the 
              maintenance of genetic diversity and cross fertilization in natural 
              populations.  The most critical assumption of the parasite  hypothesis is that
              there is selection imposed by parasites against  host genotypes that become
              locally common.  If this idea is  correct, then there will be a disadvantage to
              clonal reproduction  that is proportional to the frequency of any clonally
              produced  type.  Such selection requires that there is a genetic basis to 
              infection by parasites, and that parasites rapidly "track" locally  common host
              genotypes.  An ideal system for testing these ideas is  the snail-parasite
              interaction that Dr. Lively has been working on  since 1985.  The snail and its
              parasite ( a trematode worm) can be  easily reared in the laboratory.          
              The goal of the study is to determine whether the parasite  rapidly evolves to
              infect different clonal types, and whether it  can prevent clones from
              competitively displacing cross-fertilizing  forms.  The results will be of
              interest to evolutionary and  conservation biologists interested in the
              maintenance of genetic  diversity, as well as epidemiologists working on
              similar parasites  that cause human disease(e.g. Schistosomiasis).
