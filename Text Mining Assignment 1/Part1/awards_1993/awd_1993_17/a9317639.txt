Abstract    :
              This Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and Processing project, in the
              Inorganic,   Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program, is concerned
              with the discovery of   reactions that can be used in the development of new
              transition metal catalyzed reactions for   hydration and amination of olefins
              in aqueous and liquid ammonia solutions, respectively.  It is   anticipated
              that such processes would minimize the amount of organic waste that would be  
              generated in the synthesis of alcohols or amines.  Specific aims include the
              synthesis of new   complexes of groups 8 metals of ligands that will provide
              for solubility in water and liquid   ammonia, and the identification of
              complexes that will activate the O-H and N-H bonds of these   solvents.  One
              strategy to be employed is the oxidative addition reaction of a cationic
              complex   of water or ammonia with a low-valent complex of the same or a
              different group 8 metal.  NMR   spectroscopy will be used to detect hydride
              complexes.    A major objective in the chemical  industry is the minimization
              of waste materials that require  disposal or incineration.   Organometallic
              compounds are used as catalysts in a number of  important industrial processes;
               however, all of these use organic solvents.  The use of water, or  other
              easily purified materials  such as liquid ammonia, as solvents is one way that
              may help to  minimize such waste.  The  objective of this research is to
              explore the possibility that  organometallic chemistry can be done  in water or
              liquid ammonia.  Ethyl Corporation, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is collaborating on
               this project.
