Abstract    :
              9317710  Bromwich  This award will support a workshop at Ohio State University
              that  will be concerned with formulating the response of the U.S.  antarctic
              meteorology community to the First Regional Observing  System Test (FROST),
              which is an initiative of the international  Scientific Committee on Antarctic
              Research (SCAR) Working Group on  Physics and Chemistry of the Atmosphere.   
              The scientific goal of FROST is to collect all available antarctic  weather
              observations from standard and non-standard platforms  during three month-long
              special observation periods in order to  test the performance of forecasting
              models in antarctic latitudes  (i.e. south of 50 deg S).  Participating
              forecast centers include  the U.S. National Meteorological Center, the
              Australian Bureau of  Meteorology, the European Centre for Medium-Range
              Forecasting, and  the British Meteorological Office.  ***
