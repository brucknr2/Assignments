Abstract    :
              9317466  Hansma  DNA can now be routinely and reproducibly imaged with the
              Atomic  Force Microscope (AFM) in air and in a variety of fluids, including 
              aqueous buffers.  Building on this demonstrated capability, the  following 5
              research areas are proposed:  (1) To image the effects  of drug-binding on DNA
              conformation, using distamycin and other  peptides that induce
              conformation-changes in AT-rich regions of  DNA. (2) To increase the resolution
              of DNA-imaging by using new  improved tips and imaging environments selected
              for minimizing both  adhesion and repulsion.  Tips will be fabricated with a
              new AFM-SEM  (scanning electron microscope) combination that is currently being
               built.  (3) To label DNA with a variety of reliably distinguishable  labels
              for AFM-mapping of DNA at a resolution of several dozen  nucleotides. (4) To
              improve the quality of imaging of single-  stranded DNA.  The ultimate goal of
              this technology is the high-  speed sequencing of single DNA molecules. (5) To
              image processes  involving DNA-protein interactions in real time, such as the 
              cleavage of DNA with a restriction enzyme and the interaction of 
              single-stranded and double-stranded DNA with RecA protein.  %%%  The Atomic
              Force Microscope (AFM) s a new microscope, invented in  1986, that can feel
              surfaces with enough sensitivity to map the  size and shape of DNA and other
              biological molecules.  For many  applications, the AFM combines the convenience
              and versatility of  optical microscopy with a resolution comparable to electron
               microscopy.  Since this high resolution can be obtained even in  aqueous
              solutions, the AFM can image molecules that are  biologically active and has
              the capability of imaging these  molecules in action.  Atomic force microscopy
              of DNA has progressed  rapidly in the last 2 years.  New research can now build
              on this  foundation.  ***
