Abstract    :
               Recent work has shown major similarities across a wide range of organisms in
              the biochemical mechanisms for olfactory reception.  The fruit fly, Drosophila,
              provides an excellent model system for study because of its accessibility for
              genetics, molecular analysis, behavior, and even some physiology.  This project
              combines these techniques to address the molecular basis for olfactory
              sensitivity.  Modern genetic technology and methodology is used to isolate
              particular mutant strains of Drosophila that show particular olfactory
              sensitivity or loss.  These mutants allow identification of particular genes by
              the pattern of proteins that are expressed.  Genes that are expressed
              specifically in olfactory tissue during development will be characterized, and
              their expression or deletion correlated to specific kinds of olfactory
              behavior.  One of these genes apparently is expressed differently in males and
              females, suggesting an important role in mate recognition or other important
              reproductive behavior.   Results will be important for understanding the
              mechanisms of olfactory reception at the fundamental level of molecular
              genetics, and will have a broader impact as well on sensory neuroscience and on
              genetics, with potential applications including pest control.
