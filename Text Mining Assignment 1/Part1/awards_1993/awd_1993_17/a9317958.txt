Abstract    :
                9317958  Palenik  The flow cytometer provides the unique capability of rapid 
              analyzing the fluorescence, scattering,  and several  chemical and biochemical
              parameters of individual cells.  This proposal requests funds to acquire a flow
              cytometer for  the Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Scripps 
              Institution of Oceanography (SIO) to be jointly used by  several investigators
              working in diverse areas.  The  instrument will be used to provide samples. 
              This  information will be used to understand the morphological and  genetic
              diversity of these organisms,  their effects on the  biooptical properties of
              the water column, and their  responses to nutrient and other environmental
              stresses.  In  a novel application, the instrument will be used to 
              characterize the bioactive secondary metabolites produced by  currently 
              unculturable organisms isolated from field samples by flow  cytometric sorting.
               The flow cytometer will also be used on  laboratory cultures to study
              physiological responses of  particular species to various environmental
              stresses.  This  research is part of efforts to develop molecular probes as 
              indicators for particular stresses and to parameterize  optical models of
              oceanic photosynthesis as a function of  particular stresses.
