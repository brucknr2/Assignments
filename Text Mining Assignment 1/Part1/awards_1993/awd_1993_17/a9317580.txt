Abstract    :
              9317580  Falconer    This is a study of the  mechanism and intermediates of the
              Rochow  direct synthesis reaction between silicon and methyl chloride 
              catalyzed by copper.  This reaction can serve as a model for  understanding the
              class of solid-catalyzed gas-solid reactions.   When it is run industrially in
              large fluidized bed reactors, it  forms dimethlydichlorosilane, the  precursor
              to silicone polymers,  with selectivity as high as 90%  It is very sensitive to
              material  properties such as surface composition, the form of the catalyst, 
              concentrations of promoters, and impurities; the objective of this  work is to
              determine which materials and properties improve  activity and selectivity. 
              Reaction kinetics are measured at  atmospheric pressure in a small reactor
              attached to an ultrahigh  vacuum system equipped for surface analysis and
              sample treatment.   Single-crystal silicon surfaces are used so that the planar
               surfaces and the pits formed on reacted surfaces can be  characterized at
              various stages by scanning electron microscopy,  energy dispersive
              spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, optical  microscopy, Auger spectroscopy,
              chemical treatment, and  temperature-programmed desorption.  The effects of
              silicon-oxide  layers, silicon crystal face, zinc and tin as promotors, and 
              aluminum, iron, and calcium as impurities are determined.  Parallel  studies in
              a fluidized bed reactor will be conducted at the Elkem  Development Center in
              Sewickley, PA.        Silicone polymers are ubiquitous in modern technology
              with wide  application as sealants, lubricants, hydraulic fluids, dielectrics, 
              and other applications.  High-quality polymer requires a pure  monomer, in this
              case dichlorodimethylsilane, and it is this issue  that is addressed here.  The
              contamination of the monomer by other  silanes formed as byproducts in the
              direct synthesis reaction is  presently a problem.  This effort is coordinated
              with Elkem Corp.,  a major supplier of dichlorodimethlysilane.  Supplementary
              support  for this effort  is provided by Dow-Corning Corp., a major consumer 
              of dichlorodimethlysilane.
