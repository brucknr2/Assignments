Abstract    :
              9317901  Harwood  This award supports a study of fossiliferous glacial erratics 
              from the McMurdo Sound region.  This work will help to establish  the record of
              Eocene, and possibly Cretaceous, marine and  terrestrial biota on the margin of
              the Victoria Land basin.  The  Eocene is poorly known from Antarctica,
              represented only by  outcrops in the Antarctic Peninsula and by glacial
              sediments  recovered near Prydz Bay.  Fossils known to be present in the 
              erratics include leaves, wood, organic mats, and marine  invertebrates.  The
              goal is to study the included fossils to  determine paleontological ages of the
              sedimentary rocks and to  find clues to the paleoenvironmental conditions. 
              Specifically,  documentation of the fauna and flora in these erratics will
              allow  better understanding of marine and terrestrial biological and 
              ecological systems during the early Cenozoic and will provide a  basis for
              comparison of the Ross Ice Shelf region with lower  latitude sites in the
              Southern Ocean.  This work will also help  form a framework for interpretation
              of early Cenozoic  paleoenvironments in drill core from the Cape Roberts region
              that  is anticipated in the near future.  ***
