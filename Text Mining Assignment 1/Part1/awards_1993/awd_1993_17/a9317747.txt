Abstract    :
              9317747  Scarr  This action provides for four separate tasks directed toward  
              measuring and improving the quality of information generated by  NSF's annual
              Survey of Research and Development in Industry.    The tasks are: 1)
              Compensating for Nonresponse; 2) Evaluation of  Quality; 3) Scope, Frame
              Construction, and Sample Design and;  4) Evaluation of Mail-out and Follow-up
              Materials.  A fifth task,  Effects of Implementing Survey Changes, is also
              funded under this  action.    Under authority granted by the National Science
              Foundation  Act of 1950, NSF collects and disseminates descriptive economic 
              statistics, as well as other pertinent information, about  scientific and
              technological resource utilization and activities.  Data collected by the
              Survey of Research and Development in  Industry, when used in combination with
              data obtained through  other NSF statistical and analytical activities,
              provides policy  makers with an overview of R&D funding and performance in the 
              United States.
