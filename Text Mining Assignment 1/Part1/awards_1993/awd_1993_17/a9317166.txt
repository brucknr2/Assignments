Abstract    :
              9317166  Smethie  This proposed work is the analysis of approximately 900 water 
              samples collected in the course of the Weddell Sea Ice Camp (ISW-1)  drift and
              two cruises of the RVIB N.B. Palmer for chlorofluoro-  carbons (CFC's).  The
              results will be merged with the hydrographic  data set and other tracer data
              sets to determine time scales and  pathways of bottom water formation.    The
              technique of collecting of water samples in flame-sealed glass  ampoules has
              obviated the need for their immediate analysis for  CFC's, and will allow the
              analysis of a greater number of samples  form the ice camp.  The merged data
              sets will be used to identify  sources of newly-formed bottom water, to
              estimate the time required  to convert shelf water to bottom water, and to
              determine the extent  to which the newly-formed bottom water is in
              disequilibrium  with  atmospheric CFC concentrations.  ***
