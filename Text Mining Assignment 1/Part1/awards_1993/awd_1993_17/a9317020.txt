Abstract    :
              9317020  Morison  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program 
              ("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the
              eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B.
              Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here is to make high
              resolution measurements of the  horizontal variability of temperature and
              salinity to help  determine the three-dimensional structure of coherent
              convection  features.  The measurements will be made with instruments on a 
              remotely operated free-ranging underwater vehicle (the Autonomous  Conductivity
              Temperature Vehicle -- ACTV).    The postulated high oceanic heat flux values
              in the eastern Weddell  Sea require the existence of a mechanism that enhances
              the vertical  heat flux.  Possible such mechanisms are coherent roll 
              instabilities in the mixed layer, convection under leads and other  openings in
              the ice, or internal waves.  Single point measurements  can only suggest the
              existence of these mechanisms; the  identification of the particular mechanism
              requires information on  their horizontal variability.    The ACTV, which is
              160 centimeters long and 9 centimeters in  diameter, is capable of one hour of
              operation at a speed of two  meters per second.  It can be programmed to dead
              reckoned course as  far as 1.5 kilometers from a homing beacon, and can cover
              about  five kilometers per run.  It carries commercially available 
              thermometers and conductivity sensors whose precision is better  than one
              thousandths of a degree and one part in thirty thousand  salinity units.  The
              vehicle will be operated from a small, light-  weight hut set up on the sea
              ice, and will be deployed and  recovered through a one meter diameter hole.
