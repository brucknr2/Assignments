Abstract    :
              IBN-9317853  Tschinkel    Important basic insights into the evolution of social 
              behavior have resulted from studies of the social  organization of insects such
              as bees and ants in which  colony members are closely related.  A fundamental
              question  in these cases concerns the relationship between the  behavior of
              individuals and the success of the social unit,  the hive or colony.  This
              research will address an important  component of colony organization, the
              dynamics of the  feeding of the young (larvae) in highly social fire ants.  The
              nutrition received by developing larvae probably affects  the social role and
              size of individuals, the labor they can  perform within the colony and the
              success of the colony as a  reproductive unit.    Dr. Tschinkel will study the
              quantitative patterns and  "rules" that determine how ants feed larvae.  The
              research  will provide detailed description of feeding behavior with  both
              liquid and solid foods, information on the sensitivity  of adults to the hunger
              levels of the larvae and data on the  effects of different feeding regimens on
              the role and sexual  development of the larvae when grown.  The research will 
              provide the first full description of the rules of food  distribution by
              individuals, will link individual behavior  to characteristics of the colony as
              a whole, and will  provide a possible mechanism for the developmental changes 
              that occur as the colony grows.  These results will make  fundamental
              contributions to our understanding of the  dynamics of social insect colonies
              and, therefore, to our  understanding of the evolution of sociality.  In
              addition,  the fire ant is an introduced species that causes  significant
              economic damage, and this research has the  potential to further efforts to
              control it.
