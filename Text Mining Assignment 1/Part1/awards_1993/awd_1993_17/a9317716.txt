Abstract    :
                     S9317716  Cohen   This project involves the dissertation research of a
              student in  cultural anthropology from Columbia University.  The student will 
              investigate human exploitation of a grasslands region of northern  China. 
              Using survey techniques as well as in-depth interviews  and participant
              observation in a sample of Mongol herding  households, the student will
              investigate the people's concepts of  range management and conservation.      
              This research is important because it will contribute to our  understanding of
              the process of land degradation in a large area  of the world. Advanced
              understanding of the concepts and  understandings of peasant-herding families
              can help planners  design programs to ameliorate the problem of land
              degradation.  The project also contributes to the scientific capacity of the US
               by training a student in both the critical area of resource  conservation and
              in area studies of northern China.  ***
