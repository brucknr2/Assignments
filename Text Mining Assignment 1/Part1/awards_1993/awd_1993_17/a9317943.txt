Abstract    :
              9317943  Flynn   This proposal requests funding to extend the PIs' study of
              fossil land mammal faunas of the Andes mountain chain in central Chile.  During
              most of the last 80 million years South America drifted as an island continent.
               The highly peculiar land mammals that arose as a result of this isolation have
              captured the interest of  biologists for more than two centuries.  The PIs have
              recently discovered two new and highly unexpected fossil mammal assemblages in
              volcanic sediments of the Chilean Andes.  These assemblages help to fill in
              what was previously a very poorly understood interval in the history of South
              American mammals.  In addition, occurrence of these fossils in volcanic
              deposits enables the application of various "absolute" geologic dating
              techniques, providing a precise calibration for at least the younger of the two
              assemblages.   The project will focus on three areas in continuation of the
              PIs' study in this region.  First, field collecting and reconnaissance efforts
              will be extended to discover new localities and assemblages of different ages. 
              Second, the PIs will establish an integrated geological time framework for
              known and newly identified assemblages.  Third, preparation, description, and
              analysis of these diverse, well preserved fossils will be completed.  This will
              help clarify biotic, environmental, and geologic events during crucial
              intervals of South American land mammal history.
