Abstract    :
              9317415  Herman    The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech project between Dr. 
              Herbert Herman of the State University of New York, Stony Brook,  and Dr. Pavel
              Chraska of the Czech Institute of Plasma Physics,  Prague, is to examine the
              processing, structure, and property  relationships of net-shapes and deposits
              manufactured by water  stabilized plasma torches.  This will be done by
              comparing water  stabilized plasma formed coatings with those manufactured by 
              conventional processes.  Specifically, the researchers intend to:  1)
              Manufacture coatings, net-shapes and composites at high  production rates via
              high production rate plasma spray  technology; 2) Optimize the processing
              technology of water  stabilized plasma torches using laser diagnostics; and 3) 
              Characterize the material structure and mechanical properties of  net-shapes
              and composites.  Overall, results are expected to  improve our understanding of
              fundamental plasma/particle  interactions and particle/substrate interactions. 
                This engineering project in thermal systems fulfills the program  objective
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading  experts in the United
              States and Eastern Europe to combine  complementary talents and pool research
              resources in areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.  ***
