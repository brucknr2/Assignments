Abstract    :
              9317719  Sheehan       In this collaborative research, PIs will develop and
              evaluate  criteria for recognizing stratigraphic sequences in outer-shelf and 
              slope carbonate environments.  Recognition of sequence boundaries  in these
              settings is problematic because typical boundary criteria  are not
              applicable--exposure events are absent and stratal  geometries are difficult to
              extract from outcrop-scale exposures.   PIs will combine stratigraphic,
              sedimentologic and biostratigraphic  study of Ordovician and Silurian strata in
              the U.S. Great Basin to  develop a sequence model; the sequences will be traced
              along dip  and strike transects to evaluate changes in criteria usable in 
              identifying sequence boundaries.  This work will contribute not  only to
              understanding Paleozoic history of the Great Basin, but  also to developing
              sequence stratigraphic models for deeper-water  carbonate units.  Results will
              have use in both academia and  industry.
