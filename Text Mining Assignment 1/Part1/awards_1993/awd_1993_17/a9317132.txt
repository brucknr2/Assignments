Abstract    :
              9317132  Chen      Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are small peptide 
              hormones known to play important roles in regulating growth  and
              differentiation of vertebrates.  Studies conducted in  mammals showed that
              IGF-II is produced in the liver and  several other prenatal and neonatal
              tissues, whereas IGF-I  is primarily produced in the post-natal livers under
              the  control of growth hormone (GH).  However, the mechanism of  hormonal
              regulation of IGF-I and IGF-II gene expression has  not been determined.  Using
              rainbow trout as experimental  animals, the long term objective of this
              research is to  investigate the molecular mechanism of GH controlled IGF  gene
              expression.  To achieve this long term objective, a  list of short term aims
              has been developed for the next  three years.  These are:  (1) determining
              patterns of tissue  and developmental stage specific expression of IGF genes; 
              (2) identifying hormonal factors that regulate the  expression of IGF genes in
              vivo and in vitro; (3) assessing  the consequence of differential inactivation
              of the  production of IGF-I or IGF-II polypeptide by a combination  of
              transgenic fish and Ribozyme technologies; (4) isolating  and characterizing
              the GH receptor and its cDNA molecules.  Fish represent the largest and the
              most diverse group of  vertebrates and their unique evolutionary position
              relative  to other vertebrates and their ability to adapt to a wide  variety of
              environments make them ideal for studying the  molecular mechanisms of growth
              regulation. Results of these  proposed studies will advance the knowledge of
              vertebrate  IGF gene regulation and expression in a way that is both  easily
              generalized to vertebrate models, and will provide a  phylogenetic perspective
              that has proved useful in the  studies of other complex biological phenomena. 
              Furthermore,  these studies on GH modulated IGF gene expression in fish  will
              provide an excellent alternative model for studying the  control of growth
              factor gene expression at the molecular  level in hu mans.  ***
