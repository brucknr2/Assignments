Abstract    :
              9317075  Kettler       Despite the importance of Al and Cd chemistry to the 
              geological sciences there are few measurements of the association  quotients of
              their oxalate and malonate complexes.  The  investigator will measure the
              association quotients of Al-oxalate,  Al-malonate, Cd-oxalate, and Cd-malonate
              complexes in solutions  with ionic strengths ranging from 0.1 to 5m and at
              temperatures  ranging from 0-125 C.  These measurements will be made using 
              potentiometric methods by titrating oxalate or malonate solutions  into aqueous
              solutions of Cd or Al.  Na-trifluoromethanesulfonate  will be used as a
              non-complexing supporting electrolyte.  The data  obtained during these
              titrations will be regressed and equations  relating the relevant association
              constants to temperature and  ionic strength will be derived.       Al is the
              third most abundant element in the earth's crust.   Problems related to the
              dissolution of silicate minerals and the  environmental and public health
              effects of acid rain are  fundamentally problems of al speciation in aqueous
              solutions.   Although Cd is a trace metal, its toxicity and its ubiquity in 
              landfill leachates, sewage sludge, sulfide ore deposits, and fossil  shells
              give it great environmental and geologic importance.   Oxalate and malonate are
              difunctional carboxylic acid anions that  form strong complexes with metals. 
              These acid anions are  ubiquitous in soils and the by-product waters produced
              during  enhanced oil recovery and synthetic fuels operations.  They may  also
              be present in large amounts in some sedimentary basin brines.   This work
              should be of interest to a wide variety of researchers in  the geological and
              environmental sciences.
