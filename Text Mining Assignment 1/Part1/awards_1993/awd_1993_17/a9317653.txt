Abstract    :
              This is a request for funds to purchase a Philips CM120  Transmission electron
              microscope with a Gatan CCD camera,  STEM attachment with a dark field
              detector, cryotransfer  holder, TV imaging and image analysis system (including
               display capture and storage).  Funds to purchase a Noran  voyager x-ray
              microanalysis system with a digital imaging  workstation are also being
              requested.  The Philips CM 120  and accessories will be housed in the Medical
              School  Electron Microscopy (MSEM) Facility at the University of  Wisconsin-
              Madison Medical School.  The microscope will be  used by 7 major users (both
              NSF and NIH funded in the  Department so of Anatomy, Pathology, Neurology, 
              Neurophysiology, and Zoology and at the School of Pharmacy.  The experimental
              efforts of the major users in this multi-  user facility represent diverse
              problems in Neuroscience,  Cell and Molecular Biology.  The projects involve
              studying:  the structure of fibronectin and collagen fibrils,  generation of
              neuronal microtubule arrays, mechanisms of  secretion, neural circuits of
              visual thalamus,  characterization of medical  superior olivary circuitry, 
              regenerative phenomena of sensory and nerve cells,  development of efferent
              nerve cells and microprobe analysis  of cardiac muscle.  Although the current
              transmission  electron microscopes (Jeol 100CX and Hitachi H-600) can  fulfill
              the basic electron microscopy needs of the users,  these microscopes can not
              provide the researchers with the  following:  (1) image acquisition and
              archiving capabilities  for morphometric analysis, (2) EDX and STEM capability
              for  the detection of calcium and other elements in frozen  sections, (3)
              cryo-electron microscopy capabilities and (4)  dark-field capabilities to
              detect gold labeling.
