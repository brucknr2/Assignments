                      The overall goal of this grant will be to investigate the principal
              factors determining the large  to synoptic  scale structure of the atmosphere,
              with particular attention given to the interaction of synoptic eddies and the
              large scale circulation. The research will consist of two main thrusts:  (1) a
              study of the dynamics and importance of nonlinear energy and enstrophy cascades
              and (2) a study of how synoptic eddies affect the large scale mean structure of
              the atmosphere.  Several models of differing complexity will be used in this
              studies.  In addition, the PI will conduct a systematic, more generic, study of
              the formulation and use of economical dynamical models for atmosphere and
              climate studies. ***
