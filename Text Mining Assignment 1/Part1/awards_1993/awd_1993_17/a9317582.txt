The cultural heritage of most Native American tribal
              groups incorporates considerable knowledge of and experience with the natural
              world.  Some of this traditional knowledge includes detailed understanding of
              habits, ecological communities and cycles, seasonal variation,
              microdistributions, plant ecology, animal behavior, and the recent history of
              plant and animal species.  Despite these powerful cultural traditions, Native
              Americans are the most underrepresented minority in the sciences in general,
              and in environmentally oriented sciences in particular.  Our goal is to
              introduce Native American college students early in their careers to
              environmental research under the close supervision of top scientists in the
              field, giving them the opportunity to work on research projects during their
              undergraduate careers.  Native  students completing this program should be
              competitive with the best college graduates in the country from any institution
              in terms of hands-on research experience.    Student will begin their training
              in basic research methods at Haskell Indian College, transferring in their
              third year to University of Kansas to complete the B.S. degree.  Mentorship
              activities will be provided throughout their experience at both Haskell and
              Kansas.  A long-term goal of the program is to train and develop Native
              American professionals who will not only carry on research in Environmental
              Biology, but will also teach courses and supervise research in the
              environmental sciences at Native American institutions of  higher learning such
              as Haskell.
