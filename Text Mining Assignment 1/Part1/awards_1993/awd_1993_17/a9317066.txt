Abstract    :
              9317066  Burbank       PI and RA will continue to characterize Miocene Shadow
              Valley  basin, SE California, formed "piggy back" above a low-angle  detachment
              fault.  Further work will address proximal and distal  margins of the
              basin--sedimentary thickness, character and  chronology.  Ultimate goal is a
              new end-member model for  supradetachment basins, and high-resolution
              chronometry of major  and minor tectonic episodes.
