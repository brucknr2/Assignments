Abstract    :
                9317670  Yuille    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award to  investigate the problems of robust face recognition under lighting, 
              albedo, geometry and viewpoint variations by formulating new  modeling and
              matching alogrithms.  The approach consists of  deriving sets of models which,
              when interpolated, serve to handle  wide variations in viewpoint.  The model
              used consists of two  parts: first, a geometric model related to spatial
              variations and  individual and expression changes, and second, an imaging
              model,  which handles variations in lighting and albedo.  The research 
              involves the following four goals:  1) the design, test, and  implementation of
              algorithms to match the model described against  frontally-viewed faces, 2) the
              extension of deformable template  techniques for tracking faces and their
              features and determine an  interpretative mapping in terms of expressions, 3)
              the development  of probabilistic methodologies for first learning from a
              database  the prior distributions used by deformable templates, and later, to 
              develop a learning method to determine the maximum a posteriori  estimate of
              the model, and 4) to generalize the model to detect  multiple faces in complex
              visual scenes, and perform robustly even  in the presence of outliers and
              occluders.
