Abstract    :
              9317372  Valentine       PIs will document Neogene molluscan patterns in order
              to test  hypotheses on how origination and extinction vary along  environmental
              gradients at the species level, and, by comparison to  earlier results, across
              the taxonomic hierarchy and from background  to mass extincttion.  Latitudinal
              and bathymetric patterns will be  examined, using databases.
