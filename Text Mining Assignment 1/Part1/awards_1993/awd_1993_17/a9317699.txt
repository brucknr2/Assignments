Abstract    :
              9317699  Sullivan  Basic and Applied Aspects of this Research:  This research
              uses a  favorable model system, a duplication of the Adh gene in certain 
              species of Drosophila, to understand the causes and outcomes of  important
              molecular genetic events, which have occurred during the  evolution of this
              group of insects.  Understanding of these events  is central in formulating
              hypotheses regarding the organization and  evolution of the genome.  Currently,
              there is substantial interest  in determining the structure of several genomes
              including that of  humans.  A knowledge of genome structure offers the hope of 
              therapeutic approaches being developed for human genetic diseases.   This work
              is based on the premise that if one wishes to understand  the structure of the
              genome, then one will have to learn how the  genome was put together and the
              mechanisms which control its  assembly.
