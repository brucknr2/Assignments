Abstract    :
              9317191 Zoller  This award will fund the visit by Professor Peter Zoller of the
              Department of Physics at the University of Colorado to spend one month at the
              University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand,  conducting collaborative
              research with Dr. Crispin Gardiner on quantum noise problems in quantum
              physics.  The primary focus of the collaboration will investigate aspects of
              wave function simulations of the quantum master equations using white noise
              methods. There appear to be a number of potential applications in quantum
              optics for these noise theories. Significant experimental effort is being
              expended to observe Bose-Einstein condensation in cold atomic samples employing
              laser cooling and magneto-optical traps. The detection of Bose condensation
              using light scattering requires a theoretical formulation in terms of a master
              equation. This  U.S.-New Zealand collaboration will work on such a theory both
              from the point of view of a general master equation and the  wave function
              simulation method.
