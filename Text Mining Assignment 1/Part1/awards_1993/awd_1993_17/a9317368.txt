Abstract    :
              9317368  Beachy       Many plant viruses direct the synthesis of one or more 
              proteins required for the spread of infection from the  initial; site to
              adjacent cells.  In the case of tobacco  mosaic virus the movement protein
              responsible for spread of  the virus has been identified and extensively
              studied.  Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular mechanism  responsible for
              the spread are not well understood.  Previous studies have suggested that the
              ability of the  movement protein to facilitate virus movement is the result  of
              a combination of several functions or characteristics: 1)  association with
              plasma membranes; 2) association with cell  walls; 3) association with
              plasmodesmata with or without the  formation of fibrous material in the
              channel; 4)  modification of the plasmodesmata size exclusion limit; 5) 
              formation of large, soluble complex perhaps including RNA.  The proposed
              research will determine which functions are  required for biological activity. 
              Complementation of  nonfunctional mutants of the movement protein will be used 
              to identify regions of the protein that may be responsible  for separate
              functions.  A combination of in vitro and in  vivo studies will then be used to
              identify which functions  are associated with the mutated sequences.  %%%  The
              results of the study on the function of the virus  movement protein will lead
              to a better understanding of how  viral infections spread in plants.  In turn
              this may lead to  novel methods in preventing plant diseases.  In addition, 
              because the movement protein interacts with plasmodesmata,  the knowledge
              obtained will lead to a greater understanding  of intercellular communication
              in plants  ***
