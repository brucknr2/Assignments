Abstract    :
              9317997  Richmond   This research will use fruitflies of the genus, Drosophila,
              to study the kind and amount of variation at the molecular level in natural
              populations of this organism.  The long term goals of this work are to
              characterize molecular variation in the structural and regulatory regions of
              genes that code for the structure of enzymes that degrade ester compounds. 
              These enzymes are called carboxylesterases.  This work will help to identify
              the kinds of changes that occur in DNA and that result in differences in the
              timing in expression and the location within the organism of carboxylesterases.
               The immediate goals of this research will be to complete precise analyses of
              the DNA sequences responsible for the regulation of a specific
              carboxylesterases gene, Est-6, in Drosophila melangaster and a related gene,
              Est-5, in D.pseudoobscura.  We also plan to determine if individuals from
              natural populations of D. melangaster differ from each other in the DNA
              sequences that control the expression of the Est-6 gene in this species.  We
              will use recombinant DNA technologies to clone and manipulate esterase gene
              sequences by transferring engineered gene sequences into special strains of
              Drosophila embryos.  This work will help us to determine how the forces of
              evolution act to mold variation at the molecular level into adapted complexes
              of genes.
