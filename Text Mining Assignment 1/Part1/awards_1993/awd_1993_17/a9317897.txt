Abstract    :
              9317897  Fitzgerald  ABSTRACT    In order to function as a unit, the members of
              a social system must communicate.  For social insects, important aspects of
              communication are carried out through chemicals called pheromones.  One of the
              ways insects use pheromones is through laying down trails of these chemicals,
              which provide information to other members of the colony or social unit. 
              Fitzgerald and Webster will use molecular techniques to determine how tent
              caterpillars use trail pheromones to regulate the flow of colony mates to their
              food-finds and to their bivouacs (their "tents").  They will decode the precise
              chemical basis of these trails and determine the behavioral bases of the
              pheromone-based system of communication in tent caterpillars.  The results of
              this research will further the understanding of the evolution of communication
              in insects and may provide information that would prove helpful in controlling
              the depredations of tent caterpillars.
