Abstract    :
                Stoecker  9317732      This study will examine the feeding ecology of two
              red-tide  dinoflagellates Gymnodinium sanguineum and Ceratium furca. 
              Laboratory and field studies will test the hypotheses that  mixotrophic
              dinoflagellates:  (1) are primarily  photosynthetic organisms that become
              phagothrophic when  nutrient and/or light environments are suboptimal; (2) 
              exploit a variety of nano- and microplankton prey, but can  exhibit feeding
              preferences; (3) gain sufficient nutritional  benefits through phagotrophy to
              promote enhanced  photosynthesis and growth; and (4) feed on a diel cycle with 
              elevated ingestion of prey during the day.    Mixotrophic dinoflagellates
              appear to have relatively slow  feeding rates, but their sheer numbers under
              bloom  conditions indicate their potential importance to microbial  food-web
              structure and function.  Without a greater  understanding of feeding behavior
              in mixotrophic  dinoflagellates, their significance to microbial food web 
              dynamics and red-tide ecology will remain speculation.      ***
