Abstract    :
              9317627  Bindschadler  This award is for support for a three year program to use
              satellite imagery to  monitor the rapid changes that are known to be taking
              place in the vicinity of  Crary Ice Rise, a region of the Ross Ice Shelf,
              downstream of ice stream B.   Reconnaissance studies which will involve mapping
              the current surface dynamics  of Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers will also be
              undertaken using satellite  imagery.  Field studies to determine the location
              and character of the transition  from slow to fast ice flow in the onset region
              of ice stream D will be  accomplished in the second and third years of the
              program.  This work contributes  to the goals of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
              (WAIS) program.  ***
