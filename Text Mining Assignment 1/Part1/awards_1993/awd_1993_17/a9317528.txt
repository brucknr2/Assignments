Abstract    :
              9317528  Gea-Banacloche       Quantum-classical correspondence is studied in the
              context  of cavity quantum electrodynamics.  The objective will be to  examine
              models which run the gamut from known quasi-classical  cases to fully quantum
              mechanical ones in order to characterize  those aspects of the dynamics which
              are only well described using  the quantum theory.  The work has interesting
              implications for  the concept of quantum chaos.  ***
