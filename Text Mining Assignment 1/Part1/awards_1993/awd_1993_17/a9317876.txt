Abstract    :
              9317876  9412905  Reinhold  Tieleman  The project will develop improved methods
              for the simulation and  analysis of extreme wind loads on low-rise structures
              and will  examine the safety factors for these structures when subject to 
              upwind roughness fields of random height and fetch.  The work  includes the
              following tasks: develop turbulence simulation and  turbulence augmentation
              techniques with assessment of the effects  on peak suctions; simultaneous
              measurements of incident velocity  fluctuations and surface pressures; analysis
              of data using  eigenvector techniques and conditional sampling; develop
              criteria  for modeling wind loads including extreme suctions; measure  incident
              velocities; velocities of vortices and surface pressures  for various building
              shapes and flows; conduct similar tests  including abrupt changes in roughness;
              and test a group of  buildings including random variations of surrounding
              roughness  and buildings.  The results from this work will help in the 
              development of methods for mitigating the effect of intense  surface pressures
              fluctuations due to flow separation and vortex  generation in low-raise
              buildings along roof-wall intersections.  ***
