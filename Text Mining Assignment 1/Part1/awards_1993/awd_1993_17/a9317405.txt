Abstract    :
              9317405  Grant         The objectives of this research are:  (1) to obtain
              ground and  aircraft-based measurements of ice nuclei; (2) to quantitatively 
              describe these measurements in a manner suitable for use by  numerical cloud
              models; (3) to adapt these descriptions to a  detailed microphysical cloud
              model; and (4) to compare the  measurements and simulations with observations
              of ice formation  derived from aircraft data during WISP-94.  ***
