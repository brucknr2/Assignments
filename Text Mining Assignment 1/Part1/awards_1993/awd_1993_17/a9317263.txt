Abstract    :
              9317263  Knott       This award provides one-half the funding required to
              construct  a system for chemical extraction of oxygen from silicate rocks and 
              minerals. The extraction line will be constructed and operated by  the
              Principal Investigator in the Department of Geological Sciences  at the
              California State University-Fullerton. The institution is  committed to
              providing the remaining funds needed for the project.       Oxygen extraction
              must be performed prior to determining the  ratio of oxygen isotopes in the
              samples, a task to be performed in  the stable isotope laboratory of
              neighboring California Institute  of Technology. Analysis of the oxygen
              isotopic signature is a  critical step in the research projects of the
              Principal  Investigator on the origin of igneous rocks. The inclusion of 
              undergraduate students in research projects using this extraction  line will
              enhance the undergraduate experience at Cal State-  Fullerton.  ***
