Abstract    :
              9317598  Asper  The growing season for phytoplankton in polar oceans is short, 
              but intense.  There is an increasing body of evidence that in  many Antarctic
              habitats, the most active period may be very early  in the season, a period
              that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part
              of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring
              phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the
              Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation
              of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms
              controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications
              and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from
              spring to  midsummer conditions.  This component will focus on the  collection
              of vertical flux samples which will be analyzed for  carbon, nitrogen and total
              mass flux and also provided to the  other investigators for their specific
              analyses.  Profiles of the  abundance of large aggregates in the water column
              using a non-  contact photographic method will be made.  These data will be 
              used to complement other particle determinations, to investigate  the role of
              these aggregates in particle flux and to determine  the mechanisms of particle
              export as a function of season and  phytoplankton species.  The end result will
              be a better  understanding of the bloom processes and significant 
              contributions to the data base on aggregates and export  mechanisms in this
              environment.
