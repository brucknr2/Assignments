Abstract    :
              9317258   Covich       This research addresses effects of wood decomposition on 
              ecosystem processes in stream, riparian, and upslope locations in  a tropical
              rainforest ecosystem. Manipulation of woody debris  (removal and addition, as
              well as natural amounts of wood) will  indicate the role of wood in vegetation
              growth, aquatic and  terrestrial community structure, and nutrient cycling
              processes.  Carbon and nutrient pools, mineralization and retention, plant 
              growth, and community composition will be measured and compared  among the
              treated plots. The five-year project will indicate the  length of time wood
              continues to influence ecosystem processes.  %%%       Little is known about
              ecosystem responses to large inputs of  woody debris following disturbances,
              especially in tropical  ecosystems. Large woody debris decomposes relatively
              slowly and  provides substrates and nutrients for a variety of organisms. 
              Therefore, the large inputs of woody material following  disturbances can
              influence ecosystem processes significantly over  long time periods. This
              research will indicate the magnitude of  effect of manipulated levels of woody
              debris in stream, riparian  and upslope ecosystems in a tropical rainforest.
