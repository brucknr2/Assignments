Abstract    :
              9317200  Hansell  The growing season for phytoplankton in polar oceans is short,
               but intense.  There is an increasing body of evidence that in  many Antarctic
              habitats, the most active period may be very early  in the season, a period
              that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part
              of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring
              phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the
              Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation
              of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms
              controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications
              and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from
              spring to  midsummer conditions.  The overall goal of this proposal is to 
              determine the importance and role of dissolved organic carbon  (DOC) as an
              intermediate in the carbon cycle of the Southern  Ocean.  It is estimated that
              almost 1000 gigatons of reduced  carbon reside in this pool globally and that
              it has a turnover  time 6000 years.  The average net oceanic carbon dioxide2
              uptake  of 2.1 gigatons (Quay et al., 1992) is only a fraction of a  percent of
              the DOC pool so a perturbation in the DOC production  or sink terms could
              strongly impact the balance between oceanic  and atmospheric carbon.  Yet the
              dynamics of this large pool  remain an enigma, particularly in high latitude
              environments  where concentrations of DOC can be very high.  The specific 
              objectives of this work are 1) to determine the concentrations of  both the
              total and biologically labile pools of dissolved organic  carbon in the coastal
              polynya of the Ross Sea during Phaeocystis-  and diatom-dominated spring
              blooms, 2) to measure the rates of  mineralization and production of DOC during
              these blooms in the  surface mixed layer, and 3) to infer the export of DOC
              from the  surface waters via deep mixing.  This project will contribute to  an
              improved under standing of DOC cycling in the Southern Ocean.
