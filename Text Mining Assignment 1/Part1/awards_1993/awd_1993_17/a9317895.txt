Abstract    :
              9317895  Dauwe   This award is for the renewal of an RUI grant covering two
              years to allow Professor Dauwe and two undergraduate assistants to participate
              in the analysis of the data from Fermilab experiment E672.  The experiment is a
              fixed target investigation of the production mechanisms of charm by pions and
              protons from H, Be and Cu targets.  The data taking phase was completed in 1991
              and no further running is contemplated.  In addition to the physics goals, the
              experience in high speed computing and the association with the
              multi-university team at Fermilab will enhance the education of the students in
              a way not normally available at an undergraduate institution.  ***   v       s
