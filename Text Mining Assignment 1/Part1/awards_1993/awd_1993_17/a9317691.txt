Abstract    :
              9317691  Wilkins  This proposal requests support to permit replacement of an 
              obsolete PDP-11 computer system controlling two mass  spectrometers located in
              the Southern California Regional  Mass Spectrometry Facility. That computer
              controls both a  VG-7070 and a VG-ZAB mass spectrometer which provide  services
              to Southern California academic scientists doing  research primarily in the
              fields of biology, biochemistry,  and chemistry. It is intended to replace the
              current slow  single computer with two modern independent stand-alone  systems,
              along with the requisite interface hardware and  software. This computer
              upgrade will substantially reduce  mass spectral sample turn-around times and
              eliminate the  possibility that both mass spectrometers become inoperable  as a
              result of a single computer malfunction. As described  in the "project
              description section" mass spectrometric  analysis is a vital part of any
              synthetic research involving  preparation and characterization of chemicals
              with  biological functions. Thus, the proposed equipment upgrade  is expected
              to have a major impact upon the rate of research  progress for all facility
              users.
