Abstract    :
              9317996  Salamon       The New York Academy of Medicine has a longstanding
              mission to  improve the health of the public by acting on broad medical issues 
              ranging from basic biomedical research, through those issues  bearing on
              clinical investigation, clinical medicine, health care  delivery, public health
              activities and health policy matters.  The  Academy devotes special attention
              to defining and working toward  solutions of urban health problems.  In order
              to continue to  develop useful and important new programs, the Academy must be
              able  to provide its research and education community with access to 
              communications and information resources.  Therefore, The New York  Academy of
              Medicine requests $30,000 for a two-year grant to  establish a connection to
              the NSFNET.  This connection will  integrate the Academy's LAN into the NSFNET,
              and thereby provide  access for all of the Academy's researchers, program
              developers and  staff.  In addition, The New York Academy of Medicine Library,
              a  research library of national importance, would make its catalog  holdings
              and staff expertise accessible through the Internet.  The  Academy Library
              serves as a Regional Medical Library in the  National Network of Libraries of
              Medicine.  In this role, the  Academy would use the NSFNET connection to
              further its training and  information retrieval services to 900 health science
              libraries in  the region covering New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and 
              Delaware.  The connection would also make possible a project  enabling ten
              health science libraries in the region to obtain  Internet access via LIFENET.
