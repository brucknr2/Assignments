Abstract    :
              9317660  Evans  This award, made by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry 
              Program, provides support for a collaborative research project  involving
              Professors Thiel and Evans at Iowa State University.  During the tenure of this
              three-year continuing grant, the PIs  will investigate nonequilibrium structure
              in metal-on-metal  films using a well-defined combination of theory and 
              experiment.  Professor Thiel will explore nonequilibrium  structures which are
              formed due to limited rates of edge  diffusion, island dissolution, or escape
              from islands.  Professor Evans will carry out the complex theoretical modeling 
              of the nonequilibrium experimental systems. This unique  collaboration between
              a chemist and mathematician will allow  combined experimental and theoretical
              analyses of size and  density distributions during nucleation and growth of
              island  structures.  The experimental methods to be used include  scanning
              tunneling microscopy and low-energy-electron  diffraction.  %%%  Professors
              Thiel and Evans will investigate the experimental  and theoretical aspects of
              film growth on solid surfaces.  The  objective of the proposed research is to
              enhance our  understanding of the growth of thin films and the chemical 
              factors that control the mechanisms and rates of growth of  these
              technologically important systems.  ***
