Abstract    :
              9317775  Smith       The Gesneriaceae, the African-violet family of plants, is a
               mostly tropical group in the New and Old Worlds, little known  biologically
              except for those species prized as ornamentals.  Dr.  James Smith of Boise
              State University has pioneered the application  of new DNA-based methods of
              analysis to problems of taxonomic  delimitation and phylogenetic reconstruction
              in this family.  With  assistance from undergraduate students in research, he
              is exploring  phylogenetic relationships in representative species of all
              tribes  and most genera of the family, using traditional morphological 
              characters and new evidence from chloroplast DNA.  Concordance in  these
              independent datasets will lay the basis for detailed studies  of biogeography
              and of the evolution of pollination systems.       The comparison and
              integration of data from different sources  constitute an important arena of
              contemporary phylogenetic  research.  Taxa from predominantly tropical regions
              are rarely  explored as model systems in this debate, because in general they 
              are poorly known.  The RUI project by Dr. James Smith will  contribute new DNA
              data and refined morphological insights to the  study of Gesneriaceae in
              particular and to taxonomic methodology in  general.
