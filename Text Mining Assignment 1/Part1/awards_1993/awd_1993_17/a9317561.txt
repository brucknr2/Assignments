Abstract    :
              9317561  This award provides funds to partially support the 1994 Seminar on
              Stochastic Processes  to be held at Texas A&M University. It will be the latest
              in a successful series of annual  seminars begun in 1981 giving eminent
              researchers and young specialists the opportunity  to work together in
              discussing the state of the art in stochastic analysis, potential theory  and
              Markov processes. For young researcher this presents an invaluable opportunity
              to  showcase their work as well as to learn from the senior members of the
              audience.    This award provides funds to partially support the 1994 Seminar on
