Abstract    :
              9317726  Levi       This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research in support of
               the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) Initiative.  In an  unprecedented
              world wide effort, numerous commercial organizations  and universities have
              joined together under the Aegis of the IMS  test cast (this particular one for
              concurrent engineering) to  conduct a one year feasibility study.  This grant
              provides partial  support for a faculty member to work in this project.      
              This support is important in that the project may be the  forerunner of a new
              paradigm for the way research is to be  performed.
