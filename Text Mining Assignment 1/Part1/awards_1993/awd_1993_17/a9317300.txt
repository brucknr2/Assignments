Abstract    :
              9317300  Zhou    This research will continue work to constrain seismic
              structures  around subduction zones and the mantle.  The major objectives are: 
              (1) to gain new insight into the nature of subducted slabs through  a joint
              analysis of traveltime inversions and waveform modeling;  and (2) to map the
              mantle structure by conducting, for the first  time, whole mantle inversions
              with full 3D ray tracing.  The  results will address the depth of penetration
              of the subducted  slab, the resolving power of seismic waveforms, the dominant 
              characteristics of mantle heterogeneities as a function of depth,  and the
              importance of inclusion of 3D ray tracing in tomographic  inversions.    ***
