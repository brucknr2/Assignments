                                                9317712 Langseth This award is for support of
              a gravity and bathymetric survey of the western Arctic Ocean basin that will be
              conducted from a US Navy nuclear powered submarine.  The Arctic Ocean basin is
              the least explored of all the world's ocean basins.  Geophysical work has been
              limited to a few aerogeophysical surveys, occasional icebreaker cruises, and to
              work from drifting ice islands.  This project represents a unique opportunity
              to investigate the structure of the Canada and Makarov Basins, the Chukchi
              Plateau, and the Alpha, Mendeleyev, and Lomono sov Ridges.  The objectives of
              this work are to precisely locate the boundary between the Eurasian and North
              American plates, to constrain the tectonic models for rifted margin development
              of the Lomonosov Ridge, and to constrain models for the development of the
              Alpha Mendeleyev Ridge between the Canada and Makarov Basins. ***   #    x   \
