Abstract    :
              9317247  Valentine  In order to reconstruct and understand the nature and
              radiation of  early metazoans, PIs and Russian collaborators will study their 
              traces and compare them with the traces of modern bilaterian  metazoans.  Team
              will combine study of trace fossils with  observations of the traces produced
              by living animals of  appropriate grades, and will conduct laboratory
              experiments on the  kinetics of locomotion of these animals.
