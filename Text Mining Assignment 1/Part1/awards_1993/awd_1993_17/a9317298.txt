Abstract    :
              9317298  Fraenkel  This grant from the Organic Dynamics program supports the
              work of  Professor Gideon Fraenkel at The Ohio State University to study 
              structural and dynamic aspects of solvated and unsolvated  clusters and
              ion-pairs of organolithium compounds by a variety of  NMR techniques using
              13-C, 6-Li, NOE procedures, and line shape  analysis. The specific targets for
              study are (a) unsolvated  (RLi)n clusters, (b) interactions between RLi species
              (c)  dilithium compounds (d) slow dynamics of reorientation of ions  with
              ion-pairs, (e) mapping of ion-pairs in liquid crystal media,  (f) highly alkyl
              substituted organo lithium reagents, and (g)  mechanisms of rotation in allyl
              organometallics.  %%%  In this project Professor Gideon Fraenkel will explore
              the unique  behavior of organic compounds derived from a reaction with the 
              metal lithium. These organolithium substances tend to aggregate  or dissociate
              in solution if the solvent character is changed.  Because organolithium
              reagents are often used to produce valuable  pharmaceuticals and naturally
              occuring compounds, this project  will enhance our fundamental understanding of
              how lithium species  react and the results will help establish utilitarian uses
              of  organolithium reagents.  ***
