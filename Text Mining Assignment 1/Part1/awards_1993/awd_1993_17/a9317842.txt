Abstract    :
              9317842  Stone  This is an award to provide support for a project the objective 
              of which is to develop conceptual and quantitative bases for  models that can
              be used in engineering design of adsorption  processes for removing aromatic
              ligand pollutants from aqueous  solution and in determining the fate of these
              pollutants when  moving through soil and groundwater aquifers. The investigator
               plans on studying the physical and chemical factors that  influence the
              relationship between the substance being adsorbed  and the adsorbing medium. 
              The research involves analyzing  results of well-selected experiments designed
              to provide a good  understanding of the underlying physical and chemical
              phenomena  involved in the adsorption process and relating this  understanding
              to models that will potentially displace the  empirical, site-specific
              procedures that now characterize the  design and characterization of adsorption
              processes.    Results of this project are expected to provide a better basis 
              than now exists for predicting the fate of water pollutants that  move through
              soil and aquifers that are subject to adsorption on  surfaces of the media
              through which the water flows.  The results  may also provide improvements in
              the ability of engineers to  design soil remediation systems as well as water
              and wastewater  treatment processes that are either fundamentally based on 
              adsorption as the physical process for removal of the pollutants  or in which
              adsorption occurs as a secondary benefit.
