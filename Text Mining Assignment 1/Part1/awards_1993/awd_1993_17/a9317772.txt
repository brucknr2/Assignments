Abstract    :
              9317772  Rivers       This award provides support for the design,  construction,
              equipping and operation of several  experimental stations, jointly referred to
              as a sector, at  the Advanced Photon Source (APS) located at the Argonne 
              National Laboratory. The APS, a positron storage ring or  synchrotron capable
              of producing hard x-radiation of much  greater flux, brilliance, intensity and
              photon energy  than  previous x-ray sources, provides a revolutionary new tool 
              for research requiring an understanding of the atomic and  molecular structure
              of matter. Earth scientists dealing with  the characterization of earth
              materials in research areas  including mineral physics of Earth materials at
              very high  pressure, environmental geochemistry, and soils science will  gain
              access to APS x-radiation through the GeoCARS sector at  APS, which will be
              operated as a national user facility for  the entire earth, planetary, soil,
              and environmental  research communities in the U.S. The GeoCARS sector at APS 
              will include facilities for high-pressure research with  diamond anvil cells
              and large-volume presses, diffraction  and scattering, absorption spectroscopy
              and anomalous  scattering, and fluorescence microprobe analysis and 
              microtomography. The GeoCARS sector will be operated and  managed by the
              Consortium for  Advanced Radiation Sources at  the University of Chicago.  ***
