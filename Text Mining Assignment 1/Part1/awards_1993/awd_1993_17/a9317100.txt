Abstract    :
              9317100  Whitney  This research planning grant seeks to document the 
              metamorphic history of two massifs (Kirsehir, Nigde) within  the Central
              Anatolian Massif in Turkey.  These metamorphic  massifs have been interpreted
              as continental fragments  rifted from Afro-Arabia, and currently they occupy a
              key  tectonic position surrounded by suture zones in the Tethyan  domain. 
              Preliminary research will focus on (1) describing  mineral assemblages in
              progressive metamorphic facies, (2)  documenting mineral paragenesis and PTt
              paths using  compositional information and reaction textures, (3)  evaluating
              the physical conditions of metamorphism and  emplacement of the massifs, and
              (4) determining how further  study of these rocks might contribute to ongoing
              discussions  of the role of metamorphic fluids in amphibolite-to-  granulite
              transitions and ultrametamorphism.   Planning  activities will include both
              field and analytical work  (mineral, whole-rock analysis, isotopic dating).
