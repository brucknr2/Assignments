Abstract    :
              9317993  Dahlquist    Partial funding of the hardware needed to perform pulsed
              field gradient experiments to enhance the use of nuclear magnetic resonance to
              study the solution properties of proteins and nucleic acids has been requested.
                 The requested capability will greatly aid in 8 projects outlined in this
              proposal.  These include investigations of the substrate binding site of
              galactose oxidase, the solution structure of the  SYMBOL 101 \f "Symbol" 
              subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, the structure of an unusual DNA
              binding domain found in the project of the skn-1 gene of C. elegans, the
              structural basis of the interaction of two yeast transcription factors a1 and
              a2, the structural changes associated with mutations of the prosequence of the
              yeast carboxypeptidase and the folding pathway of the heterodimeric bacterial
              luciferase.         s  t    g   ?                           r   StringFileInfo
