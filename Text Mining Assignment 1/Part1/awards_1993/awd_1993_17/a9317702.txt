Abstract    :
              9317702  Taylor     This project investigates the dynamics of mathematical
              models of metapopulations of insect predator-prey interactions.  Previous
              theory has shown metapopulations can be more persistent than isolated
              populations, but such theory has been based on excessively simple assumptions
              about spatial structure.  This project attempts to make metapopulation models
              more realistic by including complex spatial structure in models.  The project
              will also attempt to develop a better understanding of the causes of
              metapopulation persistence and asynchronous fluctuations in population size. 
              %%%  This research is important because it will help in the development of more
              realistic population models; most natural populations show some degree of
              spatial subdivision, yet current models do not take this into account.  The
              results can be directly applied to biological pest control and to conservation
              biology.  Improved understanding of when and why metapopulations persist should
              enhance our ability to manage pest populations and conserve populations of
              endangered species.  ***
