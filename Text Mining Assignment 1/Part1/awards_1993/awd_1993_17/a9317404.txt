Abstract    :
              9317404  Stein    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor Richard S.  Stein, Department of Polymer Science and 
              Engineering, University of Massachusetts,  Amherst, and Professor Tisato
              Kajiyama,  Department of Chemical Science and Technology,  Kyushu University,
              Fukuoka, Japan.  Professor  Muthukumar Murugappan, University of 
              Massachusetts, will also be involved in the  project.  The joint research will
              focus on the  use of polymer dispersed liquid crystals as  display and light
              control devices.  The  investigators will study the phase diagram for 
              polymer-liquid crystal mixture and the kinetics  of phase separation.    The
              studies will involve two phases:  (a)  discrete systems and (b) bicontinuous
              systems.   Preliminary studies have already been carried  out on the discrete
              systems.  The purpose of  the present project is to extend these studies  to
              bicontinuous systems, to more fully explore  the liquid crystals orientation
              distribution  within domains and its change with applied  fields, to study
              surface anchoring forces  between the liquid crystals and the domain  walls and
              the effect of surface modification on  these, to study and explain the time
              dependence  of orientation changes and its effect on  scattering and to
              theoretically model these  phenomena.         ***
