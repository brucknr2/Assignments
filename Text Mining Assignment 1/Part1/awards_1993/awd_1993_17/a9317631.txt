Abstract    :
              9317631  Rosenstone    This award provides continued support of the Foundation's
              long-  term commitment for the National Election Studies (NES).  The  National
              Science Foundation created the NES research program to  sustain and enhance the
              diversified data base that supports basic  research on voting, public opinion,
              and political participation  in the United States.  NES data have served a wide
              range of other  purposes as well; serving as a testing-ground for a vast array
              of  theories regarded as basic across the social sciences.    The current award
              provides support for the 1994 and 1996  elections.  The scientific integrity of
              the time-series data  collections set over a decade and a half ago for NES will
              be  preserved.  The Board of Overseers will continue to function as a  very
              real partner in study planning and will maintain its full  role as trustee and
              representative of the larger community of  users.  There are opportunities for
              the diverse national social  science community to participate directly in the
              design and  execution of NES studies.  There are resources for improving the 
              quality of the core NES time-series data and for testing  innovations in
              theory, measurement, and data collection.  There  is a new module of items
              assessing the American electorate's  attitudes concerning the environment.   
              This research constitutes the  most important data base for the  study of
              American politics and American political behavior.  ***
