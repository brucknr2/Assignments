Abstract    :
              9317319  Padman  This project is the analysis of the data set obtained as part
              of an  integrated research program into the oceanographic structure of the 
              western Weddell Sea.  The field work was carried out from an ice  camp jointly
              occupied by U.S. and Russian scientists from February  to June 1992.  The data
              set obtained by the principal investigator  consists of high frequency vertical
              profiles of velocity and  temperature from an acoustic doppler current profiler
              (ADCP) and a  string of twelve internally recording temperature sensors, as
              well  as a Rapid Sampling Vertical Profiler, a tethered sensor system  that
              free falls through the upper 250 meters of the ocean.  The  observational phase
              of the project was extremely successful.    The objective of the analysis phase
              is to study the dynamics of  diapycnal momentum and energy fluxes in the upper
              mixed layer, and  to investigate their dependence on shear induced mixing and
              double  diffusion.  The work will also provide kinematic descriptions of  the
              barotropic and baroclinic variability of surface currents and  temperature
              which will be used to study how the free internal  gravity wave field responds
              to topography and to changes in the  large-scale hydrography.  ***
