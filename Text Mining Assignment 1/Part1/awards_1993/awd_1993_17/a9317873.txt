Abstract    :
              9317873  Koch  Light microscopic studies comprise the cornerstone of cell 
              biological investigations. No cell biology research  laboratory should be
              without access to the full complement  of modern light microscopy techniques
              for analyzing cell  structure and function. This proposal seeks matching funds 
              to purchase one inverted microscope and one upright  microscopes each having
              phase contrast, epifluorescence and  differential interference contrast optics
              with still or  video photomicrography capabilities all to be coupled to a 
              state-of-the-art image acquisition and analysis system and a  dedicated image
              processing computer. This instrumentation  will form the nucleus of a new Light
              Microscopy Laboratory.  Its acquisition continues our effort to enhance
              research  opportunities for faculty, graduate and undergraduate  students
              studying cell biology. Microscopes of the types  requested are not readily
              available at present. Researchers  must borrow time on a single research-grade
              upright  microscope or compete with students in five courses for four  student
              grade upright microscopes--no research-grade  inverted microscope or image 
              acquisition/processing  instrumentation is available at all. The requested 
              instrumentation will promote studies of cell biology of  tunicate sperm and egg
              activation, axonal transport of mRNA  in sea hare neurons, and protection to UV
              damage in plants  as well as five other minor projects.
