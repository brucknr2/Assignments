Abstract    :
              9317395  Janecke    This project will test the theory that in Eocene and
              Oligocene  times there was a fundamental tectonic boundary, between what is 
              how SW Montana and east-central Idaho, in the form of a narrow, N-  trending
              half-graben.  Structural  and stratigraphic analyses of  the half-graben and
              its sedimentary fill combined 40Ar\39Ar  geochronology will ascertain the
              regional extent of the structure  (s) and whether or not they formed due to
              fraintational collapse of  previously thickened crust  in the Sevier orogenic
              belt.  The  results will have wide application to the evolution of orogenic 
              systems world-wide  ***
