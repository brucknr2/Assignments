Abstract    :
              Sahi will construct explicit models for small representations of reductive Lie 
              groups, and use these models to study the decomposition of tensor products of 
              such representations.  These models are closely related to the local theta-- 
              correspondence for classical groups, and may be regarded as a natural 
              generalization of this correspondence.  The results are expected to have
              natural  global analogues, with applications to the theory of automorphic
              forms.  The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician
              Sophus  Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics.
               As the  mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a
              system, the  representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon
              mathematics  itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
              theoretical physics,  especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
              physics.
