Abstract    :
              9317984  Belovsky  The dominant mechanism promoting the limitation and
              regulation of  natural populations often varies among sites for the same
              species,  and over time periods for the same population. Grasshopper 
              populations from the western US grasslands demonstrate this  variability. Based
              upon independent long-term experimental studies  with grasshoppers, the PI's
              have found that in Montana populations  are food limited, whereas in Nebraska
              populations are predator  limited. The purpose of this research is to
              synthesize these  studies with regard to the changing relative importance of 
              different biotic interactions and density independent mortality at  different
              sites in different years. The synthesis suggests that  predator limitation will
              dominate at low food abundance, whereas  food limitation will dominate at high
              food abundance. The PI's will  conduct a series of field experiments at the
              Montana and Nebraska  sites to test these hypotheses.  %%%  From the standpoint
              of basic research, this project will help to  determine the relative roles of
              different biotic and abiotic  factors on herbivore populations. In addition,
              grasshoppers, in  particular, are known to be pests in agricultural systems and
               rangelands. This study will provide valuable information regarding  population
              dynamics and mechanisms to control  this widespread  group of herbivore
              species.  ***
