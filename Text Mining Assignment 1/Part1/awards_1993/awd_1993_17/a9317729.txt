Abstract    :
              9317729  Roan  This workshop will try to define  research issues crucial to the 
              transition to fuel cell or electric  vehicles.  Of all known ways to  power a
              car, these are the  technologies which have the highest  efficiency by a large
              margin in  using fossil fuels and electricity,  respectively; they also have a 
              potential for orders of magnitude  reduction in pollution.   Conceptually, the
              goal is to define  a research strategy which would  have the effect of
              minimizing the  expected value of the delay between  now and the time when such
              vehicles  are available and attractive to the  majority of automobile drivers
              in  the United States.  Because of  breakthroughs in membrane and  alkaline
              fuel cells, in lithium-  manganese polymer batteries, and in  dissociators
              which convert natural  gas or methanol to hydrogen, this  goal is now tangible
              enough to be a  worthwhile subject of serious  scientific discussion; however, 
              there is a need for  interdisciplinary research, and for  greater mobilization
              of the most  advanced scientific researchers to  address these long-range
              issues.   This workshop will attempt to  generate  such discussion and 
              interdisciplinary communication,  bringing together expert form  industry and
              government (with  existing technology and problem  definitions) with experts
              from  universities and small businesses  (with advanced specialized research 
              capabilities).  Topics will include  systems integration and control  issues
              (including advanced learning  control using artificial neural  networks),
              membrane and  electrochemistry issues, marketing  and risk management issues, 
              environmental issues, manufacturing  issues, battery research and energy 
              management issues.  ***
