Abstract    :
              9317213  Oreskes       This award provides partial funding for the acquisition
              of a  cathodoluminescence (CL) microscope system to be installed and  operated
              in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College.  The institution is
              committed to providing the remaining funds  needed for the purchase of the
              equipment. The CL technique allows  very sensitive detection of multiple phases
              of crystal growth when  viewing minerals under the microscope (various types
              and  concentrations of impurities and other defects cause characteristic 
              luminescence under electron bombardment). The CL equipment will be  used by
              researchers at Dartmouth who will apply the technique to  identify growth
              phases of ore minerals and interpret the  geochemical processes leading to ore
              formation.  ***
