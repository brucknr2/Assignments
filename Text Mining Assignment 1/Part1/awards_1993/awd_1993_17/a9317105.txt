Abstract    :
              9317105  Ayers  This research will involve experiments that identify the 
              factors which determine HFSE mobility in the mantle beneath  island arcs,
              specifically during metasomatism of the source  region of island arc basalts by
              slab-derived fluids.  The  mobility of HFSE in hydrothermal  systems depends on
              the  stability of HFSE host minerals and their solubility in the  aqueous fluid
              phase.  Hydrothermal phase equilibria  experiments at 1.5-2.5 GPa and
              800-1100oC at known oxygen  fugacities will allow identification of stable HFSE
              hosts in  a peridotite (mantle wedge) and a basalt (subducted slab) 
              composition doped with Ti and Zr.  Single-crystal aqueous  solubility
              experiments of HFSE host minerals made as a  function of  P, T, and fluid
              composition will identify  conditions that promote HFSE mobility.
