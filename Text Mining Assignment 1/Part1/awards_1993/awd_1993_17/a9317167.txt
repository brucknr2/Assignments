Abstract    :
                9317167    Kelly  This award will provide continued support for the
              Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar  and lidar facility at Kangerlussuaq,
              Greenland (formerly Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland).   SRI International will use
              the funds to continue operating, maintaining, and upgrading  the facility and
              for the scientific research efforts of its professional staff.  The 
              Sondrestrom facility is the poleward mainstay of the four-radar chain that
              extends to the  magnetic equator.  The requested funding will be used to
              accomplish the following tasks  involving both the radar and lidar systems: (1)
              Schedule and operate the radar  approximately 1200 hours per year, and assist
              in operating collocated instruments.  (2)  Assist users in planning, designing,
              and interpreting results from radar and lidar  experiments; coordinate their
              visits, including obtaining U. S. Air Force and diplomatic  approval, and
              providing logistics support.  (3)  Maintain and upgrade the radar and lidar 
              facility, and assist in maintaining other collocated facilities.  (4)  Develop
              and maintain  system software for acquiring, reducing and interpreting data. 
              (5)  Carry out World Day  observations and specific research programs.  (6)
              Provide World Day data to the National  Center for Atmospheric Research
              database and its users, and maintain a comprehensive  data library at Menlo
              Park.  (7)  Collaborate with scientists throughout the world in  scientific
              pursuits concerning the geospace environment.  (8)  Be the liaison between the 
              Greenland Home Rule Government, Danish Commission for Scientific Research in 
              Greenland, and the National Science Foundation on issue related to the
              Sondrestrom  facility.  ***
