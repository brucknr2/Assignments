Abstract    :
              9317618  Abraham    This project considers the effects of a heterogeneous
              catalyst on the oxidation of organic species containing nitrogen in an aqueous
              medium at temperatures near the critical point of water.  Candidate catalysts
              include vanadia, cupric oxide, ceria/magnesia, palladium, and platinum.  The
              stability of the catalyst in supercritical water and its effects on the
              oxidation of nitrogen-containing species, such as ammonia, pyridine, pyrrole,
              methylpyrrole, aniline, or benzonitrile, are observed.  The heterogeneous and
              homogeneous reaction rates for the chosen system are  modelled and any partial
              oxidation products are identified.  The results are described in terms of a
              consistent set of reaction pathways.    Supercritical water oxidation has been
              shown to be an effective method to destroy many hazardous chemicals, but issues
              remain, particularly in the possible production of partial oxidation products. 
              This work explores the use of a catalyst to issue complete destruction for
              wastes of the type produced by the fiber, insulation, pesticide,
              pharmaceutical, and explosives industries.       ***
