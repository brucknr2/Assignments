Abstract    :
              9317120  Gautier  The budget of Antarctic surface ultraviolet and
              photosynthetically  active irradiance will be investigated over a variety of
              spatial  and temporal scales.  This project will continue ongoing mapping  work
              to characterize the spatial variability of surface irradiance  over large
              geographical areas.  The largest scale maps will cover  the entire Antarctic
              coastline and Southern Ocean at a fifty  kilometer resolution. Higher spatial
              resolution maps will be  constructed for areas where extensive biological
              research is  conducted, and for areas where polar vortex dynamics suggest 
              important radiative phenomena.  Satellite mapping will be augmented  and
              refined by incorporating microwave satellite data for ice edge  determination
              and by utilizing Monte Carlo radiative transfer  methods to enable a greater
              variety of cloud simulations.  Field  work will include the installation during
              the austral spring of  1994 at Palmer Station, Antarctica a network of newly
              developed  sensors to augment the National Science Foundation Ultraviolet 
              Monitoring Network instrumentation there.  This project will be the  first to
              study the albedo of Antarctic peninsular snow, sea ice,  and ocean surfaces in
              the ultraviolet and will provide important  results for both physical and
              biological scientists.  ***
