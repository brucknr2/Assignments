Abstract    :
              9317874  Meikle       In this study of wild house mice, the offspring of mothers
               that always have food available will be compared to the offspring  of mothers
              that are fed on an intermittent basis.  In addition to  data on the rate of
              growth of offspring, the project will yield  information on offspring dominance
              ranks, territorial behavior  and choice of mates by daughters.  Finally, the
              reproduction of  sons and daughters in small outdoor enclosures will be
              measured  using a new DNA fingerprinting technique.  These results will 
              provide the first detailed information on how maternal  nutritional state
              during pregnancy influences the development,  behavior and reproduction of
              offspring.%%%       The study will help resolve the controversy about whether 
              maternal nutritional state has different effects on the  reproduction of sons
              and daughters in a mammalian species such as  house mice.  The results also
              will yield information about the  physiological impact of maternal nutritional
              state that may be  useful to animal breeders.  In addition, if these results
              are  generalizable to other mammal species, they may offer some  insights into
              human development and behavior.***
