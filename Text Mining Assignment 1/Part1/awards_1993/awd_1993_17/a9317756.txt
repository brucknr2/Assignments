Abstract    :
                            9317756  Edwards  Photosynthesis is composed of two general
              processes: one, the  conversion of solar energy into high energy intermediates,
              and the  other, the use of those high energy intermediates to drive 
              thermodynamically unfavorable reactions, which results in the  conversion of
              inorganic matter to organic matter.  The efficiency  of the various processes
              can be considered at three different  levels: the absorption of solar energy,
              the utilization of solar  energy in photochemistry, and the utilization of
              photochemically  derived energy for carbon assimilation.  Absorption of solar
              energy  by chlorophyll results in the formation of a strong reductant and  the
              oxidation of water at photosystem II.  From analyses of  chlorophyll
              fluorescence using modulated light, the efficiency of  utilization of solar
              energy by photosystem II can be evaluated with  respect to carbon fixation and
              photosynthetic evolution of oxygen.   In this project, analyses will be made at
              the whole plant and  cellular level to determine sinks for photosystem II
              activity and  the efficiency of utilization of reductive power in carbon 
              assimilation in C4 plant species, which have a carbon dioxide  concentrating
              mechanism.  ***
