Abstract    :
              9317036  Taylor  Low-18O hotspots like Hawaii may represent recycled low-18O 
              oceanic crust.  This hypothesis will be tested by 18O/16O  mapping of volcanic
              rocks associated with mantle plumes,  initially focusing on the Samoa and
              Guadalupe hotspot  chains.  A laser fluorination apparatus is being 
              constructed, allowing the analysis of  18O/16O on very small  samples; it will
              be used to study detailed 18O/16O exchange  behavior of aqueous fluids and
              coexisting minerals and  volcanic glasses.  Two other on-going projects will be
               completed:  (1) Hydrothermal Effects Associated with Chegem  Caldera, Caucasus
              Mtns., Russia.  This is the most deeply  erode, best exposed, young (2.8 Ma)
              caldera in the world; it  contains a remarkable zone of 18O depletion  in a 700
              m-  thick section of caldera-fill ash-flow tuff, where  coexisting phenocrysts
              and volcanic glass are drastically  out of 18O/16O equilibrium.  (2)
              Hydrothermal Systems  Associated with Faulting in Metamorphic Core Complexes, 
              British Columbia.  This isotopic study of some of the  largest metamorphic core
              complexes in the world will provide  new insight into the permeabilities of
              major fracture zones  in the earth's crust, and may help us to understand the
              role  of aqueous fluids in earthquakes.
