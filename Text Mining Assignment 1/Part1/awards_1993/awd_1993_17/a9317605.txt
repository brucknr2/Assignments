Abstract    :
              9317605  Stinebring    RUI:  Pulsar Studies of Refraction in the Interstellar
              Medium.    Dr. Stinebring's research consists of new and continuing studies  of
              inhomogeneities in the instellar medium.  In particular, he will  study the
              clumpiness which gives rise to refractive effects such  as long term
              fluctuations in pulsar intensities, organized patterns  in dynamic spectra of
              pulsars, and long term variations in  integrated electron content along the
              line of sight.  This award  is made under the auspices of the Research in
              Undergraduate  Institutions program at the NSF.  As such it will provide
              excellent  research opportunities for undergraduates at Oberlin college.
