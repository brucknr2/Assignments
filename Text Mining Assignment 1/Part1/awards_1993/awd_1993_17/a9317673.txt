Abstract    :
              9317673  Grunow  This award supports a paleomagnetic study of lower Paleozoic
              rocks in the central  Transantarctic Mountains.  The objective is to obtain
              paleomagnetic poles from  Cambrian and Ordovician-Silurian rocks ( 540 to  410
              Ma) to establish an early  Paleozoic apparent polar wander path (APWP) for East
              Antarctica.  This APWP will be  used for 1) constraining the position East
              Antarctica in Gondwana and thereby testing  the possibility of a loop in the
              existing APWP for Gondwana, 2) providing a baseline for  testing the
              possibility of allochthonous terranes in the Transantarctic Mountains, 3) 
              evaluating the possibility of movement between different parts of East
              Antarctica, and  4) testing tectonic models of the amalgamation and
              fragmentation of Gondwana.  ***
