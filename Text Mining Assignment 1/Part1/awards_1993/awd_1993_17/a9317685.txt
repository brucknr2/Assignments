Abstract    :
              9317685  Patton   This proposal requests funding to examine a set of
              interrelated questions regarding the biogeographic patterns and speciation
              processes in the South American tropical forest rodent genus Proechimys.  This
              is a large taxonomic assemblage, composed of at least nine species groups and
              approximately 25 species, but in which species boundaries are fuzzy and for
              which no hypothesis of genealogical relationships exists.  As one of the most
              locally abundant and broadly distributed components of the terrestrial small
              mammal community of the Neotropical forests, these rats offer great promise as
              model organisms to examine the biogeographic history of the Amazon Basin, as
              well as to determine processes of  divergence in that region.  The PI proposes
              to complement his ongoing analyses that have emphasized craniodental
              morphology, karyology, and protein molecules with mitochondrial DNA sequence
              data for determination of species boundaries and phylogenetic reconstruction of
              the species groups.  We will employ enzymatic amplification of DNA from the
              Cytochrome-b coding gene, via the polymerase chain reaction methodology.  We
              will also explore the utility of nuclear sequences, examining variation in the
              globin and aldolase gene families.  Emphasis will be placed on the
              determination of species boundaries, and on the examination of the riverine
              hypothesis as a force in diversification within the Amazon Basin.
