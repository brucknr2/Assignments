Abstract    :
              9317615  Merchant       This project provides partial funding for an advanced 
              industrial research workshop.  This workshop is in an area of vital  interest
              to both United States industry and academe.  The German  American Forum on
              Manufacturing Technology features two days of  presentations on current
              production engineering research at the  Aachen Institute, one of the leading
              Fraunhofer Institutes in  Germany.  It is the only forum outside Germany where
              the Directors  and Chief Engineers at the Institute appear together.  It 
              represents a unique opportunities for the United States industry  academe to
              meet these leading industrial researchers face-to-face.   In addition, there
              are presentations by two distinguished members  of the National Academy of
              Engineering.       THis will be a high quality forum (including ample
              opportunity  for individual discussions) that will provide an unusual insight 
              into current manufacturing research issues in German industry.
