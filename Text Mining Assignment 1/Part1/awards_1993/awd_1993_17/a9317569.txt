              Abstract  ATM-9317569  Anderson, Patricia M.  Brubaker, Linda B.  University of
              Washington  Title: Late Quaternary Climate of Western Beringia    This award
              supports a project under paleoclimates in Arctic Lakes  and Estuaries (PALE), a
              program that focuses on the timing,  magnitude, and rates of change in arctic
              climates during the late  Quaternary.  Understanding the complex regional
              responses to past  shifts in global climate requires: 1) the compilation of
              numerous  well-dated records of paleoclimate indicators (e.g., pollen); 2)  the
              calibration of these proxies by defining their modern climatic  relationships;
              and 3) the comparison of climatic histories inferred  from the paleo-data to
              qualitative or quantitative paleoclimatic  models.  Although such data set are
              available from lakes in many  areas of the North American and European Arctic,
              comparable  information is virtually absent from northern Siberia.  This award 
              supports a project designed to analyze pollen, spores, plant  macrofossils, and
              sediment geochemistry of lake cores to  reconstruct the late Quaternary
              vegetation and climate of Western  Beringia (northeast Siberia).  These
              histories will be  reconstructed for six study areas, which today encompass the
              range  of vegetation and climate in far northeast Russia.  Analyses of 
              surficial lake muds will improve the definition of modern pollen- 
              vegetation-climate relationships and aid the paleoclimatic  interpretation of
              fossil data.  The new Russian data will allow a  more detailed description of
              trans-Beringian paleovegetational  patterns and inferred paleoclimates. 
              Definition of such broad-  scale patterns will help paleo-data/GCM comparisons
              for the Arctic,  thereby improving the understanding of high latitude responses
              to  global climatic changes.
