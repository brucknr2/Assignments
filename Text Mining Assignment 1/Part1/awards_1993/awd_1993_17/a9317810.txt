Abstract    :
              9317810  Gruenhage       A joint conference on topology and dynamical systems
              will be  held at Auburn University on March 24-27, 1994.  This is one of a 
              series of annual conferences dating back to 1967 (for the  topology part), and
              well over 200 mathematicians are expected to  attend.  There will be seven
              major one-hour addresses and about  twenty invited half-hour talks.  There will
              be additional  sessions of fifteen-minute talks, and students will be
              encouraged  to participate.  Those giving major addresses will include John  L.
              Bryant (Florida State), Robert D. Edwards (U.C.L.A.), Charles  L. Hagopian (Cal
              State at Sacramento), Greg Swiatek (SUNY at  Stony Brook and Princeton), Stevo
              Todorcevic (U of Toronto), and  Jeff Xia (Georgia Tech).  ***
