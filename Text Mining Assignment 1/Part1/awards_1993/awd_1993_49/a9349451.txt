              Laboratory continues to investigate the determinants and consequences of soil
              organic matter (SOM) in the humid tropics.  Main activities consist of 1)
              determining the relative effects of soil texture and clay mineralogy on total
              SOM content, 2) estimating the size of different SOM functional pools, 3)
              relating their N and P supplying capacity to texture and mineralogy, 4)
              determing the relative importance of physical protection, chemical
              recalcitrance and nutrient availability on the SOM pools, and 5) quantifying
              the effects of different land use practices on SOM pools.  The CENTURY model
              will be modified for use in tropical conditions.  The results will provide a
              deeper understanding of organic matter dynamics in soils with variable charge
              which will serve as a base for improved agricultural sustainability in the
              humid tropics and more realistic estimates of CO   2           emissions to the
              atmosphere upon deforestation. ***
