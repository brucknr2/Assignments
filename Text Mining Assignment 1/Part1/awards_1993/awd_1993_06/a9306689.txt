Abstract    :
              9306689  Hall    In this project, PI's will carry out a meridional hydrographic 
              section along about 149 degrees East in the western Pacific  contributing to
              bout US and international plans for the World Ocean  Circulation Experiment
              (WOCE), along a line designated as WOCE  Hydrographic Program (WHP) line P-10. 
              One PI will oversee the  cruise, particularly measurements of hydrographic
              parameters and  nutrients, and the other will oversee the shipboard Acoustic 
              Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements.
