Abstract    :
                        The principal investigator will work on modular                      
              representation of finite groups of Lie type, and on the Macdonald              
              symmetric functions and related functions.  In modular                         
              representation theory she will investigate the Deligne-Lusztig                 
              operator and will try to obtain a combinatorial description in                 
              the case of the classical groups.  She will also investigate the               
              two-variable Green functions that appear in the context of the                 
              Macdonald symmetric functions in two variables.  Finally she will              
              investigate character values at a special class of orthogonal                  
              groups in odd dimension relating to random walks on classical                  
              groups.                                                                        
                   The research supported concerns the representation theory of              
              finite groups.  A group is an algebraic object used to study                   
              transformations.  Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool               
              in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as                          
              mathematics.  Representation theory is an important method for                 
              determining the structure of groups.
