Abstract    :
                   The research entails applications of analytic and geometric               
              techniques to the general area of symplectic geometry in the                   
              semi-classical limit.  Techniques of spectral asymptotic analysis              
              relative to the geometry of singular spaces will be investigated               
              in this context.  Further investigations into the analysis of                  
              Monge-Ampere type equations relative to the structures of Cauchy-              
              Riemann manifolds, are also proposed.
