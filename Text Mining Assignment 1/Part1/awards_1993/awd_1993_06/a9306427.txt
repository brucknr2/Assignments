Abstract    :
              9306427  Remmel       This award supports the research of Professor Remmel to
              work  in combinatorics.  Professor Remmel will continue his research  into the
              combinatorics of symmetric functions.  First, Professor  Remmel plans to
              develop the combinatorics of the Macdonald  polynomials and then he plans to
              study the action Macdonald  operators on various bases of symmetric functions. 
              Next,  Professor Remmel plans to study the computation of Kronecker  products
              and plethysms for the symmetric group and the  hyperoctahedral group.       The
              research is in the general area of combinatorics.   Combinatorics attempts to
              find efficient methods to study how  discrete collections can be organized. 
              The behavior of discrete  systems is extremely important to modern
              communications.  For  example, the design of large networks, as in telephone
              systems,  and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.  ***
