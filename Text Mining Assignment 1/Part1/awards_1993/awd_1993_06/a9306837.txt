Abstract    :
              Dale Barkey  9306837    This is a study of the spontaneous growth of
              electrodeposited metal  dendrites.  Both experimental and theoretical
              investigations of the  initiation and propagation of dendrites are included,
              with emphasis  on interfacial dynamics.  Experimental studies of the 
              metal/solution interface focus on nucleation and growth under  pristine
              conditions with high spatial resolution.  The theoretical  component relates
              these interfacial processes to the appearance of  macroscopic structure and to
              growth velocity.  Experimental  techniques include voltammetry, electrochemical
              impedance  spectroscopy, atomic force and scanning tunnelling microscopies, 
              and optical methods including shadowgraph imaging and holographic 
              interferometry. Single-crystal electrodes and needle electrodes are  used to
              examine the effects of crystalline anisotropy and curvature  on the deposition
              dynamics.    Spontaneous growth of dendrites is often the limiting factor for 
              space-time yields in technologies using electrodeposition,  including
              electrochemical processing, energy storage, and metal  finishing.  (For
              example, it is the principal cause of failure in  automotive batteries.)  This
              study is an attempt  to relate  microscopic interfacial processes with the
              appearance and growth of  macroscopic dendrites.  The emphasis is on metals of
              commercial  significance in plating, energy storage (batteries), and structural
               materials.
