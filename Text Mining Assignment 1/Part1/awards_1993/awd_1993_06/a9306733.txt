Abstract    :
              9306733  Schoen       This grant supports the research of Professor C. Schoen to
               work on Chow groups defined by cycles of higher dimensions. He  will also
              study maps of an algebraic curve to a genus zero curve  defined over the reals.
                    This project falls into the general area of arithmetic  geometry -a
              subject that blends two of the oldest areas of  mathematics: number theory and
              geometry.  This combination has  proved extraordinarily fruitful - having
              recently solved problems  that withstood generations.  Among its many
              consequences are new  error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for
              both modern  computers (hard disks) and compact disks.  ***
