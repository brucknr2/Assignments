Abstract    :
              This grant will fund a Chinese-American workshop on Non-Invasive               
              Diagnostic Techniques.  The workshop will consist of                           
              Presentations on various non-invasive techniques by both the                   
              American and the Chinese participants.  The presentations will be              
              followed by extended discussions about the technologies.  It is                
              expected that as a result of this workshop, innovative                         
              technologies and novel techniques to perform non-invasive                      
              diagnosis will be identified.  Also, areas for scientific                      
              collaborations between the participants could be identified as a               
              result of the meeting.  The results of the workshop will be the                
              subject of a report written by the principal investigator.
