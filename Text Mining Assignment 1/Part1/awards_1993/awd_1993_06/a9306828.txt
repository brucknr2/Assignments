Abstract    :
              9306828  Neuts       This research will be continuation of an active research 
              program in probability modeling.  The research will deal with  queuing models,
              point processes, and Markov chains that are  suggested by diverse applications
              in communications engineering. It  will also emphasize the development of
              algorithmic procedures for  the numerical computation of solutions.       This
              research will have broad application in the  communications industries.  It
              will include research on the  following subjects:  Quantifying burstiness,
              episodal queues, a  tractable class of Markov chains, the Viterbi model for
              multiplexed  traffic, and some special queues of M/G/1 type.  ***
