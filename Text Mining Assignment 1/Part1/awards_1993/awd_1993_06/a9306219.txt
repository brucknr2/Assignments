Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on complex fluids, fluids               
              characterized by components which tend to self-assemble, and are               
              therefore characterized by several different lengths.  The first of            
              these fluids to be investigated is the ternary mixture of oil,                 
              water and amphiphile which produces a uniform, structured fluid in             
              which oil and water are solubilized but separated by sheets of                 
              amphiphile; a microemulsion.  Among the properties to be studied               
              are the behavior in a confined geometry, the low interfacial                   
              tension brought about between oil and water, the elastic properties            
              of the amphiphile sheets, and the evolution of this phase into the             
              sponge phase.  The second complex fluid to be studied consists of              
              polymers.  The ability of a block copolymer in a ternary mixture to            
              act as a compatibilizer of homopolymers will be examined.                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Theoretical research will be conducted on two classes of complex               
              fluids.  These are fluids which have a number of interacting                   
              components which produce interesting, and often important, physical            
              properties.  Examples of complex fluids include liquid crystals,               
              microemulsions, biopolymers and polymers.  Besides offering                    
              fundamental challenges in condensed matter physics, these materials            
              all have important practical applications.
