Abstract    :
                                                  9306696  Kvam    An interdisciplinary effort
              will be followed to examine the  growth fundamentals and structure of CVD
              growth of SeGe alloys on  Si(100), over insulating layers and in constrained 
              configurations.  Studies will emphasize seeded epitaxial  overgrowth of both
              two- and three-dimensionally constrained  growth configurations.  The near-term
              target of this research is  the fundamental understanding and reliable
              controlled production  of heterostructure layers within a fully confined cavity
              by  epitaxial lateral overgrowth.  Highly strained and strain-  relieved
              materials will be examined for their microstructural  integrity.  The effects
              of limited lateral dimensions may be  tailored to remove defects from device
              regions.  Surface infrared  spectroscopy, in combination with kinetic modeling,
              will be used  to analyze the behavior of the growth, carrier and etching gas 
              species to provide quantitative descriptions of growth behavior  in both full
              wafer and seeded epitaxial growth.  Oxidation due to  atmospheric exposure and
              to thermal treatment will also be  examined.  %%%  Novel growth
              configurations(selective and confined) are proposed  to employ SiGe layers in
              Si for high-speed transistors and  optoelectronic devices.  Surface reactions
              which control this  growth, and the quality of the materials produced, will be 
              assessed.  Structural integrity of strained layers and practical  oxidation
              processes(both protective and harmful) will be  examined.  Modeling will be
              done for use in fundamental process  understanding and industrial scale-up. 
              This research will enable  reliable uniformity even in highly integrated three
              dimensional  structures and lead to  improving the general performance of 
              advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,  information
              processing, and telecommunications.  ***
