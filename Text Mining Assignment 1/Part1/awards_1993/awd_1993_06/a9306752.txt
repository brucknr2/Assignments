Abstract    :
              Membrane proteins play a variety of critical roles in cellular                 
              metabolism and physiology.  However, little is known about the                 
              process of protein insertion into the membrane and of the assembly             
              of these proteins into functional structures.  One class of                    
              membrane proteins, the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily,                 
              includes, the bacterial binding protein-dependent transporters, the            
              yeast STE6, and the cystic fibrosis gene protein. This proposed                
              study will examine the structure and assembly process for membrane             
              proteins using the ABC transporter involved in maltose uptake in               
              Escherichia coli as a model system.  This work will take advantage             
              the extensive genetic characterization that has been done on the               
              mal genes which code for these proteins, of a biochemical assay for            
              tracking the in vivo assembly of the hetero-oligomeric maltose                 
              transport complex, and of the gene fusion methodologies available              
              in E. coli.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This work will test these different models for the assembly of                 
              complex membrane proteins and, when appropriate, lead to the                   
              proposal of different or revised models for membrane protein                   
              folding.  The results from these studies will contribute to a                  
              greater understanding of the in vivo structure and assembly of                 
              membrane proteins.
