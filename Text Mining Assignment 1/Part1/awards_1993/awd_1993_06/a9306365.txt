Abstract    :
              9306365  Minshall  The importance of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) as
              an energy source in streams is well documented and considerable data exist on
              spatial and temporal patterns of FPOM in transport and in benthic storage. 
              Information on FPOM dynamics, including transport distance, rates of FPOM
              deposition and resuspension, retention time on the stream bed, the influence of
              varying hydraulic and geomorphic conditions, and direct determination of
              capture by aquatic insects, is, however, very limited.  Our initial research
              has established the efficacy of the method and its utility for tracking the
              fate of natural FPOM in two turbulent streams.  Using a unique method to label
              individual, natural particles of FPOM with 14C which enables us to recover and
              detect individual FPOM particles under natural stream conditions, we propose a
              detailed research program utilizing the developed methods to (1) quantify the
              dynamics of transport, deposition and resuspension of FPOM in selected streams,
              and (3) examine more precisely mechanism governing FPOM dynamics using
              experimental fumes.  The techniques allows us to overcome a major impediment in
              advances in stream ecology by providing direct measures of transport distance
              and rates of capture (both biological and physical), retention, and
              resuspension.  %%%  The data from these studies will provide values for these
              factors over a range of geomorphic and hydraulic conditions and valuable
              information to test and modify some of the basic paradigms in stream ecology
              including the River Continuum Concept and Nutrient Spiraling Concept.  We are
              confident that the results and methods will have broad applicability to similar
              studies in other ecosystems.
