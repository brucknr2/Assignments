Abstract    :
                   Johnson and Pisier will investigate problems in the                       
              isomorphic theory of Banach spaces and operator spaces.  The                   
              problems to be considered involve:  local theory of Lp and of                  
              operator spaces, weak Hilbert spaces, probabilistic inequalities,              
              function algebras over the ball of a Banach space, polynomially                
              bounded operators, bounded homomorphisms on C*algebras, infinite               
              dimensional geometry of Banach spaces and operator spaces.
