Abstract    :
              9306385     Kanatzidis    In the work, technologically significant conjugated
              and saturated  polymers are intercalated into lamellar hosts.  Studies on the 
              (polymer) hydrated vanadium pentoxide and (polymer) iron  oxychlorides will
              continue to better understand their structure and  properties.  Experiments to
              gain insights into the degree of  polymerization of the conductive polymers in
              these materials are  proposed.  Based on the n-type to p-type transition which
              occurs as  a function of x in (polymer) hydrated vanadium pentoxide, the 
              behavior of p-n diodes will be studied.  Single crystals of  polyanaline/iron
              oxychloride will be explored by crystallographic  analysis and charge transport
              measurements.  In what constitutes a  new research direction, new methodologies
              will be developed to  include other layered hosts, which are not amenable to
              in-situ  intercalative redox polymerization.  A variety of new conjugated 
              polymer/inorganic intercalation compounds will be prepared.  These  new hosts
              include uranyl phosphate, zirconium phosphates and  phosphonates, molybnenum
              oxides and transition metal  dichalcogenides.  In addition to conjugated
              polymers, saturated  polymers will be used to prepare novel molecular scale
              nano-  composites with layered inorganic hosts.  A full physico-chemical 
              characterization of these materials is proposed.  ***
