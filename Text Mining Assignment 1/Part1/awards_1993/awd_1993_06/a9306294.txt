Abstract    :
              9306294 Bolt          This research involves an investigation of morphological
              variation in protoanthracosaur tetrapods from Paleozoic sites in Delta, Iowa,
              and Goreville, Illinois.  New fossil materials will be prepared, specimens will
              be described, and new specimens will be named and illustrated.  The preparation
              and description of this material will increase by approximately 25% the number
              of known Mississippian tetrapod genera. %%% The morphology and relationships of
              the earliest tetrapods are poorly understood at present largely because there
              are few well preserved and well prepared specimens available for study. 
              Furthermore, some of the best represented early tetrapod groups are highly
              derived morphologically.  The Delta fossils are the oldest terrestrial
              vetebrates ever found in the United States and among the oldest in the world,
              as no more than a dozen localities are known to be of equal or greater age. 
              Both the Delta and Goreville sites have produced exceptionally well preserved
              species of terrestrial animals.  The age, exceptional preservation, diversity
              and abundance of specimens at both sites provide an extraordinary opportunity
              to learn about early terrestrial vertebrates and morphological diversification
              among vertebrate lineages.
