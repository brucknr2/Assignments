Abstract    :
                9306159  Mahowald    The ovarian follicle in most animal species becomes
              surrounded by  a follicular epithelium soon after the inception of meiosis. A 
              class of genes in Drosophila melanogaster have been identified that  are
              required both for the establishment of individual follicles and  for the
              embryonic segregation of neuroblasts. Developmental  analysis of brainiac
              (brn), an example of this class, suggests that  it provides an essential
              germline signal, required for normal  migration of the prefollicular cells to
              surround individual egg  chambers. Weak mutations in the torpedo gene (the
              homologue for the  epidermal growth factor receptor in Drosophila) display a
              strong  enhancement of the mutant phenotype, indicating that this follicle 
              cell function may be the mediator of the germline brn signal. The  brn gene has
              been mapped molecularly; it will be cloned, sequenced,  antibodies prepared and
              its expression analyzed in both wild type  and mutant ovaries (mutant for genes
              required for ovarian structure  or neurogenesis). Interactions between brn and
              other neurogenic  genes will be tested in transfected tissue culture cells.
              Finally,  mutation screens to identify interacting genes and other genes in 
              the neurogenic class will be conducted. These studies should  provide a first
              analysis of the molecular control of ovarian  follicle formation.  ***
