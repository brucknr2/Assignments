Abstract    :
              9306813  Carey    The overall goal of this 3-year project is to increase 
              understanding of regulatory signals underlying changes in  intestinal function
              during the seasonal cycle of a mammalian  hibernator, the 13-lined ground
              squirrel.  Previous studies in  the applicant's laboratory have documented
              structural and  functional changes in small intestinal tissues of ground 
              squirrels that are closely related to the seasonal cycles of food  intake and
              metabolic activity in these animals.  During the  proposed project period, we
              plan to extend our earlier findings  and determine how digestive enzyme and
              nutrient transport  function are regulated during the different activity phases
              of  ground squirrels.  This objective will be met by focusing on four  areas: 
              (1) characterization of sugar and amino acid transport at  the level of the
              brush border membrane; (2) immunocytochemical  localization of Na+-glucose
              transporter and sucrase-isomaltase  proteins in intestinal tissues; (3)
              determination of intestinal  epithelial cell age and migration rates in
              hibernating and active  squirrels; (4) determination of messenger RNA levels
              coding for  NA+-glucose transporter and sucrase-isomaltase proteins during 
              specific activity states of the squirrels.  This project will  directly address
              the increasing evidence (in non-hibernating  species) that the presence of
              luminal substrate is required for  maximal expression of nutrient transporters
              on brush border  membranes, by studying a mammal that has been shaped by
              adaptive  evolution to forego feeding for long periods of time.  Together, 
              these studies should provide a comprehensive picture that  characterizes the
              regulation of nutrient digestive and transport  function on multiple levels. 
              Information gained from this study  will increase our understanding of the
              ability of intestinal  transport systems to adapt to dramatic changes in food
              resources  in a seasonal environment.  ***
