Abstract    :
              Poulton         The object of this project is to build and experiment with a 
              new graphics engine that will eliminate the current limits to  scalability in
              commercial graphics systems.  The work centers on  a new graphics engine
              architecture called image composition,  which is radically different from the
              organization of today's  commercial systems.  In image composition, rendering
              is  distributed over a number of identical processors.  Each renderer 
              generates a full-screen image, but for only a fraction of the  primitives in
              the scene.  The system then merges these images  over a high-speed network to
              form a single image of all  primitives.  Since each subimage is independent,
              and since the  images can be merged on a distributed network whose throughput 
              scales linearly with the number of subimages, performance of the  entire system
              can be scaled up arbitrarily by adding more  processors.
