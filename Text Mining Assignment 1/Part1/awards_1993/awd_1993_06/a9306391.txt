Abstract    :
              9306391  Breene  This project will investigate algorithm transformations 
              between two massively parallel platforms: the Bus Automaton  and the Hypercube.
               Earlier, Bus Automation algorithms  were developed for straight line
              generation and recognition,  rotation of Cartesian grids, and conic
              recognition, and  Hypercube algorithms for broadcasting to subsets of 
              processors.  These algorithms exploit embeddings of Cartesian  grids based on
              quadtree addressing scheme.  The target  processor subsets may be thought of as
              subspaces, or subgrids,  of the entire (processor) space.  Using embedding
              results and  the nature of communication in the two models, fast Hypercube 
              algorithms will be sought from existing immediate Bus  Automaton algorithms,
              and visa versa.  Given the way dimension  is imposed in the two models,
              simulations of each machine by  the other and associated complexity results are
              also expected.  ***
