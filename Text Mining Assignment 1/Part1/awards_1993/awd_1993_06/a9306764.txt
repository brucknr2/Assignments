Abstract    :
              This project is centered on studies of soil microorganisms growing             
              at relatively low temperatures (five degrees centigrade).  The                 
              properties of the enzyme betagalactosidase are being studied in                
              these organism in order to understand how protein structure                    
              dictates the temperature optimum of an enzyme's activity.  The                 
              genes encoding these activities are being cloned from Arthrobacter             
              strains and compared with information found for other                          
              microorganisms with higher growth temperatures.  Creative selection            
              procedures are also being developed to isolate microorganisms with             
              other novel betagalactosidases.                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              The dominant environment of the earth and its oceans is below                  
              twenty degrees centigrade, and there is a rich source of diverse               
              microorganisms which have evolved to grow in the cold.  Enzymes                
              active at low temperatures could be used in food processing,                   
              bioremediation, and molecular biology.
