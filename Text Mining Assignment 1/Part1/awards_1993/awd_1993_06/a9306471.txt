Abstract    :
                   This proposal will develop geological positioning system (GPS)            
              technology for monitoring moose foraging and assessing effects on              
              ecosystem processes such as soil development and vegetation                    
              dynamics.  The GPS will be tested for accuracy under winter                    
              conditions in Minnesota in a variety of terrains.  One moose will              
              be outfitted with an integrated GPS-standard radio collar to assess            
              the utility of this technology for continued study of moose-                   
              vegetation interaction.  A model integrating moose foraging                    
              intensity, plant growth, soil nutrient availability over boreal                
              landscapes will be refined improve understanding of effects of                 
              foraging strategy on nitrogen distribution across the landscape.               
              %%%                                                                            
                   The spatial and temporal dynamics of animal plant interactions            
              have important consequences for ecosystem processes.  However,                 
              study of the effects of animal foraging behavior on nutrient                   
              availability and vegetation dynamics across landscapes has been                
              limited by technologies for monitoring foraging patterns.  This                
              research will assess the value of the new GPS technology for                   
              monitoring animal foraging patterns and integrating these patterns             
              with assessment of consequences for ecosystem processes.
