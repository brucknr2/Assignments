Abstract    :
              9306217  Luke       Amur honeysuckle, Lonicera maackii, is a shrub native to
              northeastern Asia but  has become an invasive weed in many midwestern states. 
              It initially colonizes a wide  range of disturbed habitats.  In northern
              Kentucky, forests presently exist in which the  understory is a dense thicket
              of Amur honeysuckle with few other plants present.   Succeeding generations can
              also become established and grow in the shade of parent  plants.  It is not
              known whether this ability to become established in deep shade is the  result
              of natural selection for shade tolerance, or of high phenotypic plasticity
              (non-  genetic acclimation).  This research will assess how succeeding
              generations of Amur  honeysuckle growing in the shade of parent plants in
              forest understories differ from  their parents in shade tolerance and
              plasticity.  %%%  This work will have implications not only for understanding
              the basic biology of this  introduced species, but for better understanding of
              the mechanisms by which invasive  weeds are able to dominate natural and
              agricultural areas.***
