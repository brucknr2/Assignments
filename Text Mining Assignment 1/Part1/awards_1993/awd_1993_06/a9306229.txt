Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will analyze the qualitative                   
              behavior of solutions to several partial differential equations                
              arising in the theory of phase transitions.  Of particular                     
              interest are the Cahn-Hilliard, Hele-Shaw, and Phase field                     
              equations.  The structure of the set of equilibria for each model              
              will also be discussed.  Techniques involve the theories of                    
              singular perturbations, invariant manifolds, and spectral                      
              analysis for differential operators as well as classical                       
              estimates for solutions of partial differential equations.                     
                   This project is concerned with several mathematical problems              
              associated with phase transitions in solids.  In this context                  
              different phases of a nonhomogeneous material are distinguished                
              by different concentrations of their components.  The                          
              mathematical equations involved in this project also arise in                  
              many other areas of science and geometry and therefore it is                   
              expected that results here will have far-reaching effects.  Among              
              the phenomena addressed by the principal investigators are the                 
              spontaneous creation of a fine-grained structure, nucleation                   
              whereby widely separated particles undergo rapid growth, and                   
              coarsening of the micro structure of the material.  All of these               
              phenomena have significance with respect to material properties                
              such as the brittleness and superconductivity of an alloy or                   
              ceramic.
