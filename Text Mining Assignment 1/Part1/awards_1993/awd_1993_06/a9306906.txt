Abstract    :
              9306906  Nath       Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be 
              concerned with the role that supersymmetry plays in high energy  physics.  This
              symmetry relates fields describing matter, such as  those for the electrons and
              protons, and those describing the  interactions among them.  It can be used to
              furnish information  on quantities which are measurable at presently available 
              energies, and will be important in furthering our understanding  of the forces
              which exist among the elementary particles.  ***
