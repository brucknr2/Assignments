Abstract    :
              9306603  Burney   Paleoecological techniques will be employed to characterize  
              anthropogenic versus background-level environmental change and extinction in  
              Madagascar. Trends in biotic communities will be measured on long time scales  
              to contribute information on temporal variability, paleobiogeographic  
              distributions, and causative mechanisms needed to evaluate and predict present 
               and future biotic responses to environmental stress. Stratigraphic microfossil
                analyses, will be combined with collaborative efforts in dendrochronology,  
              paleontology, archaeology, and geochronology to evaluate competing   hypotheses
              concerning the causes of the late Holocene subfossil extinctions,   and to
              begin constructing models of biotic change in Madagascar on ecological   and
              evolutionary time scales.   %%%  This research represents an ideal opportunity
              to conduct an interdisciplinary   study of the causes of large-scale
              extinctions. In particular, the research will   attempt to evaluate the effects
              of human land use versus climate change on   patterns of biodiversity in the
              tropics. Such information is essential for   understanding and predicting
              future man-induced changes on global species   richness.  ***
