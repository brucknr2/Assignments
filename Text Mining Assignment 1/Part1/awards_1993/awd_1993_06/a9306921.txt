Abstract    :
                      9306921  Bloomfield  This research planning grant for women supports
              studies exploring  the potential role of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)
              in  mediating the response of bone to changes in mechanical strain.   Previous
              investigators have developed valuable animal models to  quantify and describe
              in detail the nature of the bony response to  increases in loading experienced
              by bone, as well as to the  decreased loading of various immobilization
              treatments.  Little is  known, however, about cellular or molecular mechanisms
              for the  subsequent gain or loss in bone volume routinely observed with  these
              conditions.  Specifically, how do bone cells perceive strain  and then
              transduce that mechanical signal to a biochemical factor  which then initiates
              increases in bone formation activity (in the  case of increased loading) or
              suppresses formation in favor of  resorption (in the case of decreased
              loading)?    The planning activities of this proposal will provide training in 
              two primary tools essential to this line of research: bone  histomorphometry
              and molecular biology techniques to isolate and  quantify mRNA for IGFs from
              bone tissue.    ***
