Abstract    :
              9306943 Givinish          This research involves a molecular systematic study of
              the monocot plant family Rapateaceae.  Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation will
              be examined using both restriction site maps and nucleotide sequences of the   
              ndh   F gene and    rbc   L    atp   B spacer.  These data will be used to
              derive a molecular phylogeny, and this phylogeny will be sued to interpret
              morphological changes and the distribution and ecology of the family in both
              Africa and South America. %%% The family Rapateaceae presents several
              opportunities for research on various questions involving adaptation.  In this
              family there are several pollination systems involving bees, hummingbirds,
              flies, and weevils, and it is unknown whether species that share similar
              pollinators and flowers are closely related.  Broader relationships of the
              Rapateaceae and Bromeliaceae are of interest to plant biologists, and different
              morphological features support alternative hypotheses.  A molecular phylogeny
              will provide a test of these hypotheses.  Finally, this research will
              contribute to one of the world's largest live plant and frozen plant tissue
              collections.  This collection will be a major contribution to the plant biology
              community.
