Abstract    :
              This research Planning Grant for Women is aimed at gathering data              
              that will direct future investigations into the role of                        
              physiological processes in plant speciation.  The first objective              
              is to explore physiological adaptations to low water and nitrogen              
              availability in a single species, the desert annual composite,                 
              Townsendia annua by estimating correlations of water- and nitrogen-            
              use efficiency with fitness, measuring heritabilities and trade-               
              offs, and evaluating phenotypic plasticity and ontogenetic                     
              variation for physiological and other adaptations to low resource              
              availability.  This work will assess the genetic limitations to                
              adaptations and will set the stage for later studies of                        
              physiological evolution.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Botanists have long recognized that the distributions of plants are            
              limited by their ability to tolerate stressful environments such as            
              deserts.  But this begs the question of why some plants can adapt              
              and others cannot.  This project explores the genetic potential for            
              physiological adaptation in a desert plant in the sunflower family.
