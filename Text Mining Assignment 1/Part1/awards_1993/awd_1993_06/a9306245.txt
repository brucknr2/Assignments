Abstract    :
                   It is proposed to address the question of how intuitive and               
              concise linear model concepts and techniques can be extended to                
              nonparametric settings and it is also proposed to develop                      
              nonparametric techniques for model diagnostics that can be used                
              for dimensionality reduction and to address the question of                    
              adequacy of particular models.  More precisely, it is proposed to              
              focus on procedures that are counterparts to such commonly used                
              linear model ideas as regression coefficients, correlation                     
              coefficients, ANOVA decompositions, and principal components.  In              
              addition, it is proposed to consider nonparametric tools for                   
              model building, identification, and diagnostics including tests                
              for linearity, partial linearity, additivity, etc. All estimators              
              to be considered depend on smoothing parameters needed in                      
              estimation of curves and surfaces.  A large part of the research               
              will address the problem of developing reliable data-based                     
              methods for smoothing parameter selection.                                     
                   With the advent of computer data bases of unprecedented size              
              and complexity and with dramatic increase in computer power, it                
              has become increasingly more desirable and possible to develop                 
              general models, concepts, and procedures that can be used to                   
              study relationships between variables and to construct models                  
              less dependent on specific assumptions. It is proposed to extend               
              commonly used linear model ideas and techniques to this more                   
              general setting  and to  assess the adequacy of models with                    
              simpler structure.
