Abstract    :
              9306349 Bertness          This study examines the relative importance of
              positive interactions in shaping salt marsh plant communities.  It tests the
              hypothesis that positive interactions are characteristic of harsh physical
              environments since sessile organisms frequently buffer one another from
              physical stress.  The project will examine the distribution of facilitative
              phenomena across salt marsh stress gradients to quantify the association of
              facilitative interactions with stressful habitats, explore the mechanisms (s)
              responsible for generating facilitative interactions among marsh plants, and
              investigate the community repercussions of facilitative associations on the
              distribution patterns of marsh plants. %%% In contrast to competition, the role
              played by positive interactions in natural communities has received little
              attention and is usually ignored in general discussions of community
              organization. This work will directly examine the importance of facilitative
              phenomena in affecting process and pattern in a widespread native plant
              community and thus contribute to understanding the role played by facilitations
              in nature. ***
