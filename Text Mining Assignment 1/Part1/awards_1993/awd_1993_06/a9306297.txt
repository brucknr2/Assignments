Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Gessel to work              
              in enumerative combinatorics related to lattice paths,                         
              permutations, and symmetric functions.  Many of these problems                 
              deal with methods for counting objects, which are in general very              
              difficult problems.  The problem related to lattice paths                      
              involves counting nonintersecting paths according to the number                
              of left-hand and right -hand turns, and finding a combinatorial                
              interpretation to some generalizations of the ballot numbers.                  
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
