Abstract    :
              9306237  Orians       This workshop will address the consequences of diversity
              or species loss for ecosystem processes, such as primary and secondary
              productivity, soil formation, nutrient cycling, and resistance to or recovery
              following disturbance, in tropical forests. Participants will explore ways in
              which these processes depend on species richness in general or on the presence
              of particular species.  Those processes that appear to be most sensitive to
              species loss will be identified as priorities for future study.  %%%      
              Current assessment of consequences of global change has focused on species
              loss.  Much less attention has been directed to consideration of the
              consequences of species loss for key ecosystem processes that affect regional
              climate, soil fertility and ecosystem stability.  Increased understanding of
              the ecosystem function of biodiversity will improve assessment of the
              consequences of global change and loss of species from tropical forest
              ecosystems.  ***   u    ~       le on request from Publications, NSF, 1800 G
