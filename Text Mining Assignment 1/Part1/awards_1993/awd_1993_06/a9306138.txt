Abstract    :
                   Huang will study the relationship between representations of              
              a semisimple Lie groups and those of its covering group.  He will              
              investigate how their unitary duals and Kazhdan-Lustig conjecture              
              are related.  He will also extend the major results of harmonic                
              analysis on symmetric spaces to a certain class of homogeneous                 
              spaces which he terms polar.  These are homogeneous spaces for                 
              which the restricted adjoint representation is polar in the sense              
              of Dadok.                                                                      
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation             
              theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics                
              itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon                   
              theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary               
              particle physics.
