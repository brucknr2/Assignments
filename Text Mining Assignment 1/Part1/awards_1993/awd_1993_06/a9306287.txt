Abstract    :
                   Rubin works in the area of the arithemetic of elliptic curves             
              and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.  The major focus of              
              the proposal is to generalize to modular elliptic curves a new                 
              method discovered by Rubin which uses special values of p-adic L-              
              functions to construct rational points of infinite order on rank-1             
              elliptic curves with complex multiplication.                                   
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
