Abstract    :
              9306190  Bilham         The northward movement of India is responsible both for
              the  Great height of the Himalayan peaks and for the recurrence of  devastating
              earthquakes in Asia from northern India to Mongolia.   Yet the collision rate
              and the distribution of slip among tectonic  units in Asia remains to be
              measured directly.  The PI has  established a network of control points in
              India, Nepal and China  whose remeasurement and analysis will provide velocity
              estimates  of the large scale processes of north-south convergence and east- 
              west extension.  These numbers will constrain the kinematics of  the Tibetan
              Plateau, and the rate of strain development responsible  for great earthquakes
              in the Himalaya.  In 1993/4 he plans to  measure a small geodetic network
              across the Altyn Tagh fault, the  largest on-land strike slop fault outside
              California, which will  further constrain deformation rates in Tibet and the
              Kun Lun  Mountains.  Elsewhere, by operating GPS receivers in Nepal and 
              inviting colleagues in India and China to operate receivers  simultaneously on
              key tectonic units in their countries he is able  to undertake cost effective
              measurements of large scale Asian  tectonics.  ***
