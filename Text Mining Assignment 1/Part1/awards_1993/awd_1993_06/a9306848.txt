Abstract    :
                      9306848  Burd  This Career Advancement Award for Women provides partial
              support  for a sabbatical leave.  The goal of the study is to examine cell 
              lineage of and differential gene expression in the olfactory  placodes of the
              frog, Xenopus laevis.  Cell lineage experiments  consist of injecting dyes into
              cells in the anterior neural plate,  and following the migration of injected
              cells with a SIT camera and  time-lapsed video recordings.  Likewise, the
              source of cells in  regenerating olfactory placodes will be determined.  Two
              genes  (distal-less and empty spiracles) known to be expressed in mouse 
              olfactory placodes will be characterized in Xenopus placodes.  The  pattern of
              expression of these genes will be determined with in  situ hybridization and
              Northern blots.  This study will determine  factors that regulate
              differentiation and regeneration of the  olfactory placodes.      Development
              of a fertilized egg into a multicellular organism is  controlled by an array of
              genes and tissue interactions that  determine the fates of particular cell and
              tissue types.  The goal  of this study is to examine developmental expression
              of genes and  the formation and regeneration of the peripheral tissue for the 
              sense of smell, the olfactory epithelium, in the frog.  Fluorescent  dyes will
              be injected into cells that are thought to form or reform  the olfactory
              placode, the precursor tissue to the olfactory  epithelium.  The long-term goal
              of this study is to determine the  molecular and cellular factors that regulate
              development and  regeneration in the developing nervous system, using the
              peripheral  olfactory system as a model.  ***
