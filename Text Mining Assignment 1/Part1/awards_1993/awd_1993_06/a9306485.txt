Abstract    :
              9306485  Simon  In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program 
              of the Chemistry Division, John Simon will apply a variety of  experimental
              techniques to investigate the photochemistry of  chlorine oxides and nitrogen
              oxides in solution in order to  determine information about their gas-phase
              behavior.  The  photodynamics will be followed by time-resolved electronic and 
              infrared absorption as well as electronic emission.  Samples  will be examined
              in polar and inert nonpolar solvents as well  as in optically transparent
              glasses.  The PI will interact with  scientists at other research institutions
              in order to develop a  more complete understanding of the photoreactivity of
              these  species.  %%%  Many chemical reactions give different products when they
              take  place in a liquid phase than the same reactions do in the gas  phase. 
              This work will help determine the effect of solvents on  chemical reactivity. 
              These solution-phase studies will also  offer a means of determining in a
              controlled manner the  chemical behavior of atmospherically important chemicals
              under  the influence of light source such as the sun.  As a result of  these
              investigations our understanding of tropospheric and  stratospheric
              photochemical processes will be enhanced.  ***
