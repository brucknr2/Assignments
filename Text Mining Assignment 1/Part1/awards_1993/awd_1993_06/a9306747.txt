Abstract    :
              Award provides partial support for the 7th Annual Pennsylvania                 
              State University Plant Physiology Symposium, organized by the                  
              Pennsylvania State University Graduate Program in Plant Physiology.            
              The topic for 1993 is "Plant Signals in Interactions with Other                
              Organisms".  The symposium brings together 26 papers focusing on               
              the mechanisms and molecules involved in recognizing other                     
              organisms (including conspecifics), cuing defensive responses to               
              pathogens, herbivores, and parasitic plants, establishing                      
              relationships with microbial symbionts, manipulating floral                    
              attractants, and attracting protective arthropods.  Spatial scales             
              of these phenomena range from extremely local (e.g., gene                      
              regulation) through intermediate (e.g., fungal elicitors) to long-             
              distance (signals amoung plant individuals).                                   
                                                                                             
              The approach is comparative and synthetic.  The goals are to                   
              produce state-of-the-art reviews of each topic, but provide                    
              treatments that permit the evaluation of similarities and                      
              differences among various signaling mechanisms so as to put them in            
              suitable functional, ecological, and evolutionary contests.                    
              Another goal is to clarify present confusion about the functions of            
              multiple signals, and potential interactions among multiple signals            
              in single systems.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Plans are also presented for supporting posters and attendance by              
              graduate student and postdoctoral level scholars.  The proceedings             
              will be published by the American Societh of Plant Physiology.
