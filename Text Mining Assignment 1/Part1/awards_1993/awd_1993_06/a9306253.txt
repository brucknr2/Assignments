Abstract    :
              9306253  Williams    This  project  explores how atomic bonding across 
              interfaces  is  affected  by elemental bonding.  The specific technique  used 
              is  charge-transfer  imaging,  a new microanalytical  tool  developed  under 
              prior NSF research.  The electron energy-loss spectrum  is  sensitive  to the
              bonding state.  This is measured as a  function  of  segregation  phenomenon
              and compared to  theoretical  models.  Changes in the spectra due to charge
              transfer effects are  imaged  directly  and  compared to conventional electron 
              images  of  the  defect   structure  and  compositional  maps  of  the  
              segregant  distribution. The images have sub-nanometer resolution  by  using 
              the  latest advances in electron energy-loss spectrometry in  the  field 
              emission  gun  electron microscope.  Metal  systems  under  study  include 
              nickel aluminide with boron addition  to  improve  toughness  and  copper  with
              bismuth  impurity,  known  to  cause  brittleness.  %%%  For  the  first  time
              it may be possible to verify theories  that  purport  to  explain  phenomena
              associated  with  grain  boundary  segregation.  The  data are valuable input
              to  advanced  computer  simulations  used in theoretical descriptions of 
              bonding  across  interfaces.  ***
