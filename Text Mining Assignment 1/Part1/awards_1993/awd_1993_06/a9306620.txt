Abstract    :
              IBN 93-06620  Yasukawa                              ABSTRACT    students who are
              considering careers in science.The process  by which individuals choose their
              mates is  fundamentally  important to the study of animal behavior, and a clear
               understanding of this process has important implications for  many other areas
              of biology, as well as for human behavior  and social organization.  In some
              species, many males  commonly have several mates at one time while many others 
              have none.  Why females are willing to mate with males who  already have mates
              is a question that has interested  biologists for decades.  Drs. Yasukawa and
              Enstrom will  investigate mate choice in such a species of bird, focusing  on
              the role of distinctive male plumage.  Use of DNA  fingerprinting will allow
              the genetic fathers of nestlings to  be identified, so that female choice both
              of social partners  and of genetic mates can be studied.  Finally, the effects
              of  genetic parentage on male care-giving will be studied by  assessing the
              male's contributions of food to nestlings and  his willingness to defend
              nestlings against predators.  These  studies will help to fill a conspicuous
              void in our knowledge  of mate choice and will provide research experiences for
               several college.
