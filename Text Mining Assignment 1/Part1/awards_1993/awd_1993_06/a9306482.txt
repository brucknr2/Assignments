Abstract    :
              This is a study of the mechanism of bacterial infection of                     
              susceptible plants.  Integration of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens              
              T-DNA into the plant genome results in characteristic pathology.               
              Bacterial infection involves transfer of T-DNA and some proteins               
              from the bacterium to the plant.  T-DNA and virE2 protein transfer             
              is mediated by proteins which are products of the bacterium virB               
              operon.  Studies planned are aimed at:  (1) characterizing the                 
              behavior of the virB proteins, particularly the possible formation             
              of membrane-associated aggregates.  Cross-linking approaches will              
              be employed.  The expression stoichiometries of the virB proteins              
              will be examined.  The roles of individual virB proteins in the                
              transport process will be evaluated via mutations of individual                
              virB genes.  (2) The transport mechanism itself will be examined               
              through use of chemically modified or mutagenically modified virE2             
              protein, which may interfere with the transport mechanism.                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Plant pathogens play an important role in the dynamics of the                  
              planetary biomass.  More specifically, these pathogens affect                  
              ornamental as well as agriculturally important species.  Therefore,            
              beyond the intrinsic interest in the assembly of a complex system              
              to transfer genetic information from the bacterium to the plant,               
              the characterization of the infection process may lead to                      
              development of selective intervention strategies with economic and             
              environmentally positive consequences.  The studies planned utilize            
              biochemical and genetic approaches to characterize the mechanisms              
              by which bacteria infect susceptible plants.
