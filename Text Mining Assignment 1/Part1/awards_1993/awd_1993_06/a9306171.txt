Abstract    :
              9306171 Woese          In renewed studies on bacteria, Dr. Carl Woese of
              University of Illinois continues investigations of the evolution, phylogeny,
              and classification of microbes through the analysis of genomic sequence data
              from ribosomal RNA in order to quantify genetic differences between groups of
              bacteria.  By comparing the sequence of ribosomal RNA from a variety of
              organisms, a branching pattern of genealogical affinity can be constructed with
              the use of computer analyses of the hundreds and thousands of nucleotide bases
              involved.  Few nucleotide differences between taxa indicate close evolutionary
              relationship (the sharing of similar genomes from a close common ancestor)
              whereas greater mutational differences indicate more ancient divergence between
              lineages.  Three groups are targeted for study this time: purple photosynthetic
              bacteria; certain neglected groups of Gram positive bacteria; and cytophaga,
              flexibacter, and bacteroides subgroups.  %%%          An additional benefit of
              the phylogenetic analysis of bacteria is the ability to design diagnostic
              molecular "fingerprinting" probes, that can be used in ecological and medical
              studies to identify unknown bacteria.  Also, the phylogenetic relationships
              revealed through comparative nucleotide sequence analyses provide an
              evolutionary framework for studying other aspects of microbial physiology,
              biochemistry, and ecology.
