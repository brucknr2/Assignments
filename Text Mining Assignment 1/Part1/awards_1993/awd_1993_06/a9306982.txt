Abstract    :
              In collaboration with experimental gravity wave research  groups at Stanford
              University, Louisiana State University  and the University of Maryland, Prof.
              Wellstood will design,  construct and test sensitive dc Superconducting Quantum
               Interference Device (SQUID) measuring systems which are  specifically
              configured for use in ultralow temperature  Weber-bar gravity wave antennas. 
              At a measuring frequency  of 1 kHz and a temperature of 50 mK, the SQUID
              systems will  achieve an energy sensitivity of 100 h/2 within 2 years and  10
              h/2 within 3 years.  To ensure testing of the systems  under realistic
              conditions, the performance of the SQUIDs  will be measured on superconducting
              resonant motion  transducers as well as in conventional well-shielded 
              cryogenic probes.  At the end of the two test periods, a  working SQUID
              measuring system with the appropriate  sensitivity will be delivered for
              incorporation into an  antenna which is cooled to 50 mK.    By using a high
              performance SQUID measuring system on an  ultralow temperature antenna, the
              sensitivity of the antenna  to gravitational radiation will be greatly
              improved, and  there will be a much better possibility of actually  detecting
              gravitational radiation for the first time.
