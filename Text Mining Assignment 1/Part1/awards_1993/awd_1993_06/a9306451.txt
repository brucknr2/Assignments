Abstract    :
              9306451  Chang    This two-year award supports U.S.-Italy cooperative research
              in  visual languages between Shi-Kuo Chang of the Visual Computing  Laboratory
              at the university of Pittsburgh, and Stefano levialdi  of the Image and Icon
              Laboratory at the University of Rome,  Italy.  The research will also involve
              participants from the  Institutes of Information Science at the University of
              Salerno  and the University of Bari.  The objective of the resarch is to 
              investigate the fundamental methodologies and theory in visual  languages for
              human-computer interaction.    The research will investigate three topics in
              visual languages:   user modeling for visual interface, data modeling for
              visual  access of databases, and visual language system design.  The  expertise
              of the research team is complementary; all participants  are well-known in the
              field.  Chang and Levialdi have strong  research background in parallel image
              processing.  The  participants from Salerno and Bari have expertise in
              databases,  formal languages, and visual language theory.    * * *
