Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will use two new and promising techniques to address              
              the important question of accumulation of organic matter in regions            
              of the ocean where traditional methods of calculating accumulation             
              cannot be used.  Those methods depend on the presence of calcite,              
              of which geochemical analyses can simultaneously provide age                   
              control and inferred production and carbon flux to the sediments.              
              Regions with sporadic or absent calcite are among the most                     
              productive in the world (high northern and southern latitudes,                 
              continental margins), where the changes in accumulation are likely             
              to have the greatest effect upon global carbon budgets.  If the                
              proposed work is successful, it opens the door to addressing                   
              questions of carbon accumulation in the present-understudied parts             
              of the world ocean.
