Abstract    :
              9306850  Sutko    This proposal will attempt to determine the molecular and 
              cellular changes that occur in the crooked neck dwarf (cn)  mutation in
              chickens.  This mutation causes changes in embryonic  skeletal muscle that are
              lethal to the embryo.  These changes  include muscle dysfunction and the
              inability to maintain  embryonic skeletal muscles and connective tissues which
              result in  skeletal muscle degeneration and cell death.  This investigator  has
              found that cn skeletal muscle cells maintained in primary  cultures form
              myotubes which degenerate and die, which is similar  to what occurs in ovo. 
              This project will identify the cellular  components and processes in how these
              changes cause the lethal  effects in the mutant.  An in vitro system with the
              properties of  the mutant phenotypes will permit application of a number of
              cell  and molecular biological techniques.  The hypothesis of these  studies is
              that a failure to make normal alpha ryanodine  receptor, a skeletal muscle
              sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium  release channel, is the initial defect of the
              cn mutation.  A  knowledge of the proteins and processes that are altered to 
              produce the cn phenotype will provide insights into the  development of
              embryonic muscle and factors involved in muscle  cell viability.  ***
