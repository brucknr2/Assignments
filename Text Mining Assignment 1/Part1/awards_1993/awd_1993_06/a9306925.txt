Abstract    :
                   Octopuses of the near-shore and open-ocean marine realm are               
              ecologically diverse but poorly known taxonomically.  Species and              
              genera are usually discriminated by external features of morphology            
              that may well represent convergences in styles of predation.  Dr.              
              Voight will conduct intensive histological studies of arm                      
              musculature and digestive tract organs to describe these systems in            
              detail and thus acquire new characters for taxonomic comparison and            
              phylogenetic analysis.  Special emphasis is placed on arm muscles,             
              suckers, esophageal crop, gills, and salivary glands and ducts.                
              %%%                                                                            
                   In a research planning grant Dr. Voight will begin intensive              
              histological studies of the arm musculature and digestive system of            
              octopuses of the world.  The goal is to describe these systems in              
              detail and thus acquire new taxonomic characters for the                       
              recognition of species and genera, and eventually for inferring                
              phylogenetic relationships among the ecologically diverse groups of            
              near-shore and open-ocean octopods.
