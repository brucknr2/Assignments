Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a National Academy of Sciences                    
              (Committee on Geodesy) workshop on airborne geophysics.  The                   
              emergence of high precision, high speed, Geodetic Positioning                  
              System (GPS) technology has created opportunities for new                      
              research in aerogeophysics.  Primarily, this technology allows                 
              for much higher resolution work in research projects using                     
              airborne study methods ranging from photogrammetry to                          
              geopotential field measurements.  The workshop will focus on the               
              potential role of high-precision, kinematic, GPS in                            
              aerogeophysical research of the future.
