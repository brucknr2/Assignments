Abstract    :
                   This research involves the study of random processes on                   
              trees.  In particular, for random walks on random trees, problems              
              to be studied include the speed of the walks and the Hausdorff                 
              dimension of their harmonic measure.  These questions are                      
              analogous to current investigations in differential geometry.                  
              Another problem is to approximate negatively curved manifolds by               
              trees in order to study some random processes on manifolds.                    
                   This research involves the study of random processes on                   
              trees.  Trees are structures that are often more realistic than                
              Euclidean spaces as models for movement of random processes.                   
              This research will contribute to a better understanding of random              
              processes.
