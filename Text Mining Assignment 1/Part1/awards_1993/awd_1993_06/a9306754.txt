Abstract    :
              9306754  Pielke       The poorly understood impact of a variety of land/surface 
              factors on the atmosphere is one of the major uncertainties  limiting
              atmospheric predictability.  The Principal Investigator  will continue an
              ongoing research program studying land/surface  processes with the following
              four specific goals:    1.   Validation of a vegetation/soil parameterization
              and exploring       coupling of a mesoscale atmospheric numerical model to an  
                  ecosystem dynamic model.    2.   Investigation of the effect of landscape
              patchiness on:       boundary layer structure; development of mesoscale      
              thermally-forced flows and deep cumulus convection.  An       emphasis will be
              placed on effects of Amazon deforestation.    3.   Evaluation of the
              predictability of atmospheric flows as a       function of spatial scales of
              land/surface patchiness.  This       includes further investigation of the
              hypotheses that       inhomogeneous land/surface features can improve
              predictability       as compared to a homogenous surface.    4.   Development
              of a parameterization of landscape effects for        large-scale atmospheric
              models.    If successful, this research will produce better land/surface 
              parameterizations which will lead to improvements in atmospheric  numerical
              modeling including both short term forecasting  (mesoscale) and climate
              modeling.  ***
