Abstract    :
                   The purpose of  this project is to determine how the                      
              properties of atomic nuclei such as, for example, their                        
              shapes, depend upon their temperature and rotational                           
              velocity.  Increasing temperature or rotational velocity can                   
              induce transitions between different nuclear shapes, i.e.,                     
              prolate, oblate, spherical, etc.  A single nucleus may also                    
              undergo transitions between a normal fluid phase and various                   
              kinds of superfluid phases, i.e., there may be correlated                      
              pairs containing two neutrons (or two protons) which have                      
              parallel or anti-parallel intrinsic spins, or there may be                     
              correlated pairs containing one neutron and one proton.                        
              Since hot nuclei are small systems, they should have                           
              significant fluctuations in (a) their shape, (b) the                           
              orientation of the shape relative to the rotation axis, and                    
              (c)  the strength of their superfluity.  The neutrons and                      
              protons occupy orbital, which are determined for each                          
              combination of temperature and rotational velocity.
