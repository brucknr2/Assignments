Abstract    :
              9306316  Lafyatis       This proposal is for an experimental investigation of 
              the van der Waals interaction between a ground state alkali  atom and a
              conducting macroscopic surface. The goals of the  investigation are:       a)
              to resolve a long standing discrepancy between the       only previous study of
              this nature and what is widely       regarded as a reliable theoretical
              treatment       b) to make benchmark measurements to maximally       challenge
              the theories for these fundamental       interactions       c) to make the
              first measurements of the van der Waals       potential energy function for
              atom-surface distances       where retardation effects are important.  The
              proposed experiment consists of passing a laser slowed  atomic beam over an
              extremely flat gold surface and  measuring downstream the density of the beam
              bent by van der  Waals forces into the geometric shadow of the surface. By 
              using laser slowing and working with near atomically flat  surfaces the
              experiment will make measurements for atom-  surface distances from 10 nm to
              850 nm. The proposed  experiments complement the ongoing Rydberg atom-gold
              surface  studies of Hinds and Haroche. The proposed work will  directly address
              the long standing experiment-theory  discrepancy. The physics of a ground state
              atom's  interaction with a conducting surface differs in important  ways from
              that of a Rydberg atom's interaction.
