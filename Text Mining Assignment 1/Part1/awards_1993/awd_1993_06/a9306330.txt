Abstract    :
              9306330  Ostfeld  Tree invasion of open fields is critical to processes of
              forest regeneration, generation of biodiversity, and wildlife habitat. Previous
              research provided evidence that consumption of tree seeds and seedlings by
              rodents has a profound effect on the rate and species composition of tree
              invasion during forest development. Current theories concerning oldfield
              succession, keystone species , and herbivore-plant interactions are unable to
              provide a foundation for predicting effects of rodents given variation in: (1)
              rodent population dynamics, (2) habitat characteristics of invasion sites, (3)
              density and composition of seeds and seedlings, (4) size and growth rate of
              seedlings, and (5) distance from the forest edge. This research will use
              experimental, comparative, and modelling approaches to generate a predictive
              understanding of the effects of small mammals on forest regeneration. Results
              from field observations and experiments will be used as parameters for an
              individual-based predictive simulation model of the dynamics of tree invasion
              in old fields.  %%%  Results from this research will provide valuable
              information on the mechanisms affecting patterns of forest regeneration during
              oldfield succession in the eastern United States. These results are expected to
              apply to ecological restoration of forest biodiversity, maintenance of
              powerline corridors, and the management of forest ecosystems.  ***
