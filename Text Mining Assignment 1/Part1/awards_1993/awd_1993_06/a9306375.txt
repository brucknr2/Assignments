Abstract    :
              9306375  Straub  John Straub is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and 
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop new algorithms for  performing
              many-body classical dynamics and global energy  optimization.  He has recast
              the classical molecular dynamics  problem into a Liouville operator which
              operates on a time  dependent phase space distribution represented by a Hartree
               product of Gaussian wave packets.  The result is a set of  simple first order
              equations of motion for the approximate  time-dependence of the distribution at
              contant temperature or  energy.  This methodology will be applied to studies of
              the  dynamics of atoms or molecules on surfaces, the simulation of  molecular
              fluids and biomolecules, and enhanced free energy  perturbation calculations. 
              In a second but related area of  study, Straub will develop a method for
              finding the global  energy minimum on a potential energy surface through an 
              approximate solution to the Schrodinger equation in imaginary  time.  %%% 
              Computer simulations have provided a number of molecular level  insights into
              chemical processes which occur in solution and on  surfaces.  The technique is
              very powerful, but is limited by  statistical sampling problems associated with
              the speed of  current supercomputers and the time available to perform such 
              simulations.  Straub is developing a new algorithm for  performing molecular
              simulations which should be a major  improvement in statistical sampling.  If
              successful, this new  algorithm could provide a significant decrease in the
              amount of  computational resources required to obtain meaningful sampling 
              statistics in molecular simulations.  ***
