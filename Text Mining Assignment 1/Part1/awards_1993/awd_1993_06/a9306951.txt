Abstract    :
              9306951  Andrei    This project will investigate the finite frequency
              conductivity of  high-Tc superconductors.  The finite frequency response could 
              provide important clues to the understanding of the mechanism of 
              superconductivity in these materials.  It is also essential in  various
              applications such as the construction of low loss  transmission lines or
              resonant cavities, where the performance is  limited by the finite frequency
              dissipation in the superconductor.   The project will focus on developing a
              radio frequency  spectroscopic technique to measure the conductivity in the 
              superconducting state in the frequency range O.4-4 GHz.  At the  lower
              frequencies, the experiments will access an as yet unexplored  region of the rf
              conductivity of these materials.  %%%  This proposal investigates the
              resistance of high-Tc materials for  currents in the radio frequency range
              (overlapping FM broadcasts  and airplane radar frequencies).  The behavior of
              the resistance at  these frequencies has not been measured, and will provide 
              fundamental information about the high-Tc materials.  It is also  essential in
              various applications such as the construction of low  loss transmission lines
              or resonant cavities, where the performance  is limited by the finite frequency
              dissipation in the  superconductor.  ***
