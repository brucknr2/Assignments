Abstract    :
               Historically, parallel computers have focussed on a   single  mode  of
              parallelism:  Multiple-Instruction Multiple-Data  (MIMD)   Single-Instruction,
              Multiple Data (SIMD).  Some new    computers efficiently  implement both
              paradigms in a single  integrated   ``universal'' architecture  capable of
              supporting  large numbers of powerful processing   nodes in a design  scalable
              to teraflop computation.  Clearly, this capability   to  perform well on  both
              SIMD and MIMD computation is the  basis for many future  high-performance
              architectures.  This  hybrid parallelism is   also ideally suited  for
              implementing  many algorithms for large-scale   mathematical programming, 
              since these methods require powerful individual processors   for  the solution
              of  optimization subproblems (which may take the  form of a   medium-sized
              linear or  quadratic program), efficient  message passage capabilities   for
              the transfer of  subproblem  solutions, and efficient synchronization and  
              SIMD-style  operations  across processors.  Proper algorithmic design thus
              allows the   solution of  optimization ``megaproblems'' that  were intractable
              on   preceding architectures.  This project focuses on network-related
              optimization problems   because  such  problems arise in a great variety of
              real world  applications   for which there  are real data as well as problem 
              generators.
