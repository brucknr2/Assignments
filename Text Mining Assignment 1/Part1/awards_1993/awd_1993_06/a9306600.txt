Abstract    :
              9306600  Van Valkenbugh    Support is requested for a one-day symposium entitled
               Craniofacial Adaptations of Faunivorous Mammals to be held as  part of the
              annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists,  December 27-30, 1993 in
              Los Angeles, California. Feeding  adaptations and behavior are fundamental
              aspects of mammalian  evolution and ecology and have been well studied in both
              primates  and herbivorous hoofed mammals. In contrast, Faunivorous mammals 
              (species that consume vertebrate and invertebrate prey) have  received
              comparatively little attention. Yet, faunivores include  a wide range of
              mammals, such as insectivores (e.g. shrews),  carnivores (e.g., cats), 
              piscivores (e.g., fish-eating bats),  and omnivores (e.g., pigs). They range in
              size and shape from  shrew with a mass of less than two grams, to polar bears,
              which  exceed 500 kilograms. In spite of this diversity, faunivorous  mammals
              are united by the necessities of capturing, killing, and  consuming prey.
              Anatomical specializations of the skull and teeth  for these activities are
              apparent at both macroscopic and  microscopic levels and include increased
              skeletal and dental  strength, accentuated cutting blades on the teeth, and
              load-  bearing modifications of skull architecture. Over the past ten  years,
              research in cranial and dental structure has accelerated  and diversified,
              benefiting from the application of several new  technologies such as scanning
              electron microscopy and computed  topography. It is now time to bring together
              previously  independent researchers for not the synthesis of work-to-date and 
              an appraisal of current and future research directions.  ***
