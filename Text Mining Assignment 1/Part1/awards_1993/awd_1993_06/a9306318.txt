Abstract    :
                   This project will support research in the analysis and                    
              development of algorithms for large-scale convex programming                   
              problems.  Two of the most versatile algorithms have been                      
              interior point methods and splitting methods based on the                      
              proximal point algorithm.  Specific areas of research will                     
              include:  (1) the interior point transformation, involving the                 
              analysis of the mapping in interior point methods that sends an                
              interior feasible pair to its coordinatewise product; (2)                      
              infeasible interior point methods, including bridging the gap                  
              between the feasible and infeasible interior point methods; (3)                
              convergence of the proximal point method, including the analysis               
              of the global and local convergence behavior of the proximal                   
              point method and its modifications; and (4) interior point                     
              methods for nonlinear problems, involving the development of                   
              practical interior point methods, especially primal-dual methods,              
              for special classes of nonlinear programs and monotone                         
              complementarity problems.                                                      
                   Two of the most important modern algorithms for the                       
              numerical solution of large-scale convex programming problems                  
              have been interior point methods and proximal point methods.                   
              Both of these methods have had a major impact on modern numerical              
              solution techniques for problems that were previously thought to               
              be intractable because of their massive size.
