Abstract    :
              9306412  Dieci       Luca Dieci will work in the area  of computational 
              equations.  The PI and his collaborators will undertake several  projects,
              centered around the following two:  (1).  Numerical  Solution of Matrix
              Differential Equations;  (2).  Numerical  Approximation of Invariant Tori.     
               More in particular, Luca Dieci expects to continue working  on differential
              Riccati equations (DREs) and on applications  related to these equations. 
              Algorithmical and theoretical work  is specifically planned for the numerical
              solution of symmetric  DREs, a common occurrence in Engineering applications. 
              The main  effort here will be in studying stable indirect solution  strategies
              for the DREs, rather than direct discretizations.   Luca Dieci intends also to
              continue studying numerical questions  connected to the integration of matrix
              equations whose solution  is a unitary matrix.  He plans to devote time and
              resources to  the approximation of Lyapunov exponents, an issue which provided 
              the motivation for studying matrix equations with a unitary  solution. 
              Finally, he intends to continue the work on  approximation of invariant tori
              dynamical systems.  In  particular, he expects to extend and improve upon the
              previously  studied PdE approach.  Here, the main directions of research will 
              involve theoretical and practical study in order to complete the  approximation
              theory for the nonlinear case, and in order to free  the numerical procedures
              from the explicit knowledge of a  coordinate system in which to parametrize the
              tori.  The main  plan consists in using the continuous theory of Fenichel and
              in  making it into a numerical procedure, and in carefully studying  the
              associated implementation details.       The above projects have a strong
              computational component and  aim at developing reliable and rigorously
              justified algorithms  for important problems in computational ODEs.  ***
