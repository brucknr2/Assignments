Abstract    :
              Latombe  This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  This 
              research will investigate the spatial reasoning issues raised by  such
              questions as In which order can a product be assembled, what  parts should be
              removed from the assembled product to allow the  extraction of a specified
              subassembly, and what is the complexity  of the required motions and grasps. 
              The effort will also develop  efficient algorithms to answer these questions,
              given a CAD  description of a product.  The goals of this research include: (1)
               Developing assembly planning algorithms that take a wide range of  constraints
              into account, including part collision, subassembly  stability, grasping, and
              fixturing, in order to produce realistic  assembly plans; (2) Improving the
              computational complexity of these  algorithms in order to make them efficient
              enough to be eventually  applicable to products made of several hundreds or
              thousands of  parts, for which automated reasoning tools are particularly 
              critical; (3) Developing algorithms for inferring the inherent  complexity of
              an assembly product, i.e., a lower-bound on the  complexity of all assembly
              plans for this product along various  dimensions (e.g., number of steps, hands,
              motions, degrees of  freedom); and (4) Studying incremental versions of the
              above  algorithms that will be applicable at low marginal cost while a new 
              assembly product is being designed, in order to provide quick,  pertinent
              feedback to the designers.  These issues will be  investigated with the use of
              the ``non-directional blocking  graph,'' which addresses the intrinsic
              structure of a product as  determined by the potential interference relations
              among its  components.  Because the intrinsic interference structure of a 
              product is a compact representation of all feasible assembly plans,  not just
              of a few of them, it should make it possible to estimate  inherent complexity
              measures of the product and generate plans with  the lowest complexity, without
              having to explicitly enumerate all   assembly plans.
