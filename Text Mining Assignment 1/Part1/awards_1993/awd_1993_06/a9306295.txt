Abstract    :
                 This research will examine soil carbon dynamics in a free-air                
                                                                                            
              carbon dioxide exchange (FACE) experiment.  FACE technology                    
              provides an enriched carbon dioxide atmosphere by pumping carbon               
                                                                                             
              dioxide through vents surrounding experimental plots.  This                    
              technique avoids confounding effects of increased temperature and

              and will compare carbon storage and turnover in soil between                   
              experimental and control treatments.

                 Increased carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere is expected

              carbon dioxide for experimental purposes has been hampered by                  
              technical limitations.  The new FACE technology offers an                      
              opportunity to examine effects of carbon dioxide enrichment on                 
              ecological processes.  Forest soil organic matter represents a                 
              major pool of carbon.  Carbon dioxide enrichment likely will                   
              alter                                                                          
              turnover of this pool with potential consequences for further                  
              carbon accumulation in the atmosphere.  Therefore, this research               
                                                                                             
              will substantially improve our understanding of consequences of                
              global change.
