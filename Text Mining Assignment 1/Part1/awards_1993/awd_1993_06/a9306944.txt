Abstract    :
              9306944  Hsieh  Determination of turnover times and sizes of soil organic matter
              (SOM) pools has been one of the major problems in SOM dynamics studies because
              of the limitations of the current techniques.  Recently developed radiocarbon
              methods seem to provide a solution to the problems.  These methods take
              advantage of the residual bomb 14C (14C = carbon 14) effect in the atmosphere
              to determine the turnover times and sizes of active and stable SOM pools.  The
              time window for applying these radiocarbon methods is rather narrow now: 
              perhaps scientist have only a decade or so to do the job.  The author also
              proposes to collect and preserve as many soil samples as possible while the
              residual bomb 14C effect is still significant.  %%%  Those samples will be an
              irreplaceable and treasured resource for future studies in SOM dynamics.  The
              results of this proposed work will provide a great wealth of information on the
              role of SOM to carbon and nutrient cycling of many ecosystems.  They will also
              provide needed data for modeling studies of the global carbon cycle.
