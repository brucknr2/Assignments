Abstract    :
                   This proposal seeks funds for partial support of on                       
              international conference to assess the efficiency of taxon-based               
              conservation, restoration, and management programs using chelonians            
              (turtles and tortoises) as model systems. The workshop will examine            
              conservation problems and develop remedial strategies. A task force            
              will be established to oversee the field testing of these                      
              strategies after the conference. The approaches, methodologies and             
              solutions discussed at the conference will have important                      
              applications pertaining to a wide range of organisms. The                      
              conference will contain a blend of participants including                      
              ecologists, conservationists, planners, and governmental                       
              representatives. The proceedings of the conference will be                     
              published.

              This conference is an important, timely, creative, and                         
              cost-effective forum for the discussion and dissemination of                   
              information regarding the conservation, restoration, and management            
              of chelonian species. The results of the conference will also yield            
              important implications for conservation biology, in general.
