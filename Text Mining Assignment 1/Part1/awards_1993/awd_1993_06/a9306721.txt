Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A 21-year record of butterfly faunal composition and seasonality               
              has been obtained along an environmental gradient across northern              
              California, from sea level over the crest of the Sierra Nevada.                
              Some 175 species have been monitored.  This data set potentially               
              bears on many ecological questions, including the nature and                   
              stability of interspecific association, the determinants of                    
              biological seasonality, the sensitivity of species to fluctuations             
              in weather and the potential of entire faunas to respond to                    
              directional climatic change.  The data are in binary (presence-                
              absence) form, and satisfactory statistical methods for extracting             
              such information from them need to be developed, tested and                    
              refined.  Recent advances in a method called "conjunction                      
              analysis" are encouraging.  This project will maintain the                     
              established sampling program.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Research projects of this type are, in addition to being important             
              to basic ecology, of significance to the better management and                 
              conservation of vulnerable species.  Additionally, such studies                
              may bear on pest management approaches for agriculture since many              
              butterflies  and moths can reach epidemic densities.
