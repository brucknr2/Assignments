Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Zhang to work               
              in combinatorics.  The investigator will continue his                          
              investigations in the topics of circuit covers, circuit                        
              decompositions, integer flows, and edge-colorings of graphs.  The              
              major targets in this project will be the circuit double cover                 
              conjecture and integer flow problems together with some related                
              problems, including the question of 3-edge-coloring for some                   
              families of graphs.                                                            
                   The research is in the general area of                                    
              combinatorics.Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to              
              study how discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of              
              discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.              
              For example, the design of large networks, as in telephone                     
              systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science all                  
              deal with discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial                
              research.
