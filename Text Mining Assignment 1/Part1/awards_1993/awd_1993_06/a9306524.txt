Abstract    :
              9306524  Goldberg       Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will
               include study of mechanisms for producing anomalously large  numbers of
              certain particles in collisions at high energies.  These particles are carriers
              of the weak nuclear force.  A second  related project consists of the analysis
              of a new model for the  generation of matter, as opposed to anti-matter, in the
              early  universe.  The research plays a key role in the understanding of  the
              present structure of our universe, and the elucidation of its  origin
              constitutes a major opportunity to enlarge our knowledge  in both theoretical
              elementary particle physics and cosmology.  ***
