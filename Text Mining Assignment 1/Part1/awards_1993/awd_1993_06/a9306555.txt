Abstract    :
                9306555  Benyajati    The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms
              and  regulation of the transport of taurine in vertebrate kidneys.   Taurine is
              an abundant amino acid which functions as an  intracellular osmolyte, important
              in the regulation of cell volume.  The snake kidney can simultaneously reabsorb
              and secrete taurine   and membrane and membrane vesicle preparations have been
              used to  study the transport mechanisms in this species.  The experiments in 
              this proposal will test the hypothesis that secretion of taurine  across the
              kidney cells occurs under conditions of low osmolality,  low NaCl/and or high
              K+concentration in the extracellular fluid.   These studies will be done in
              intact animals, isolated units of the  kidney (nephrons) and isolated
              membranes.   Conditions of renal  transport in vivo will be correlated with the
              specific transport  characteristics at the membrane level in vitro.  These
              studies will  provide new information on the mechanisms by which taurine
              preforms  its functions, and will also aid in understanding  osmoregulation  at
              the cellular and organismic levels.   ***
