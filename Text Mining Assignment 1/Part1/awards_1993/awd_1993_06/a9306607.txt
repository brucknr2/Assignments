Abstract    :
                   Large-scale genomic rearrangements including the loss of                  
              significant amounts of DNA are known to occur during the                       
              development of the organism in several groups of animals and some              
              plants, but the mechanisms for these changes and the functions                 
              served are not known.  Dr. Wyngaard in a career advancement award              
              will be learning new DNA-based technologies to explore the pattern             
              and process of chromatin diminution and genomic rearrangement in a             
              group of freshwater copepods (planktonic crustaceans) where these              
              phenomena are well known.  Probes for particular classes of DNA                
              will be used to test whether DNA excisions involve specialized                 
              groups of genes and whether the sequence of losses has functional              
              effects in the development of the organism.                                    
              %%%                                                                            
                   Chromosome rearrangements and loss of significant amounts of              
              DNA, the genetic material, characterize groups of ciliated                     
              protozoa, crustacean copepods, and nematodes during the development            
              of individual organisms.  Dr. Wyngaard in a career advancement                 
              award is applying powerful new molecular methods to the study of               
              these phenomena, in particular to determine whether classes of                 
              genes are excised during development and whether the sequence of               
              losses has functional effects in growth and maturation.  The work              
              will advance understanding of molecular genetics and evolution in              
              animals.
