Abstract    :
              9306633 Shaffer          This proposal will derive a phylogeny for the major
              lineages of chelonians (turtles) using nucleotide sequence data from several
              mitochondrial genes.  This phylogeny together with information on fossil dates
              for the divergence of various turtle lineages will be used to examine rates of
              molecular divergence in turtles, thus providing a test for the molecular clock
              hypothesis.  Morphological character divergence also will be examined in light
              of the relationships depicted by the molecular phylogeny. %%% Since the
              pioneering efforts of Zukerkandl and Pauling (1965), an increasingly large
              group of biologists have been intrigued with molecular data as a source of
              phylogenetically informative characters and a means of providing an independent
              estimate of divergence times using a molecular clock.  The research outlined in
              this proposal will contribute directly to these two major areas of interest by
              exploiting the living diversity of turtles and their superb fossil record. ***
