              Funds are awarded for support for the 26th Annual Meeting of the               
              Northwest Regional Developmental Biology Conference to be held                 
              Thursday through Saturday May 6 - May 8, 1993, in the conference               
              facilities at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver B.C.               
              The main theme for the conference will be transition between                   
              developmental states.  This theme will be introduced by the opening            
              plenary lecturer (Gerold Schubiger) and expanded upon by the                   
              symposium speakers (George Sprague, Ry Meeks-Wagner, William                   
              Harris, and Barbara Wakamoto).  Presentations by participants will             
              be scheduled for a poster session or one of four platform sessions.            
              Emphasis is on graduate student attendance and participation,                  
              including awards for the best student platform and poster                      
              presentations.  Attendance in the range of 100-150 is expected.                
              The award will be used exclusively to lower the cost of room and               
              board for the estimated 55-75 graduate students expected to attend             
              the conference.
