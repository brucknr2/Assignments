Abstract    :
              Abstract - Bauer - 9306905    The method presently used to convert methane to
              liquid fuels is based on the Fischer/Tropsch process.  This is environmentally
              undesirable and relatively inefficient.  In general, methanol as a motor fuel
              is not attractive because of the energy intensive process used to produce it. 
              An alternative is a possible homogeneous pyrolysis and oxidative mechanism for
              methane conversion which would introduce an inexpensive initiator that
              generates copious levels of H, O, or OH radicals at temperatures well below
              that required for C-H bond fission, and addition of a component that induces
              branched chains for additional initial rapid radical production.    The PIs
              plan to experimentally test a thermal conversion mechanism under homogeneous
              conditions, that appears attractive based on an extensive computer analysis of
              the chemical kinetics processes that occur during co-pyrolysis of methane with
              selected radical initiators, at relatively modest temperatures.  Specifically,
              they plan to validate a pyrolysis process in flow-tube reactors operated in the
              800 to 900 SYMBOL 176 \f "Symbol" C temperature range and 5 to 30 atmospheres
              operating pressures, using free-radical initiators derived from highly branched
              alkenes or alkanes, commixed with the methane, at approximately 1% levels,
              concurrently with added 1 to 2% oxygen.  Two types of experimental tests will
              be undertaken to validate the process and to measure product distributions
              developed in bench-scale trials: (1) the use of a "wall-less" laser heated
              reactor, and (2) tests using "bomb" experiments. Various operating conditions
              will be explored to  optimize conversions to desirable higher molecular weight
              hydrocarbons.         !   & # $ % ' v ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 @ 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; <
