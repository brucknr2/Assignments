Abstract    :
              9306153     Geary       PIs will document environmental changes in shallow-water
               fauna, associated with emergence of the Isthmus of Panama.  Using  stable
              isotope analyses of surface- and bottom-dwelling  foraminifera, they will 1)
              determine age of final closure of the  seaway; 2) document environmental
              divergence on either side of the  isthmus, and 3) generate chronologic profiles
              of environmental  conditions across the shelf through the period of circulatory
               restriction and cutoff.  Study will be integrated with ongoing work  on
              mollusks and deep-sea forams.  Together studies should provide  framework for
              interpreting evolutionary and ecological patterns  associated with this event.
