Abstract    :
              9220906  Dudash       Inbreeding depression has been the subject of considerable
               attention for over 100 years.  Although many researchers have  quantified how
              progeny generated by self-matings perform poorly  relative to progeny generated
              from matings between two different  individuals, few empirical studies have
              focused on the differences  in inbreeding depression in populations that differ
              in their  natural outcrossing rates.  The main goal of the proposed research 
              is to determine the underlying genetic basis of the expression of  inbreeding
              depression in two closely related native species from  northern California, the
              self-pollinating Mimulas micranthus and  the insect dependent (thus
              outcrossing) M. guttatus. The objectives  are three-fold.  First, to quantify
              the degree of inbreeding  depression in terms of both male and female function
              in two  populations of both the selfing and outcrossing species.  The  effects
              of inbreeding on female reproductive function are well  documented, but he
              effects on male function, such as pollen  production are largely unknown. 
              Second, the genetic basis of  inbreeding depression will be quantified by two
              greenhouse breeding  experiments.  Third, among-family level variation in
              inbreeding  depression will be quantified in the outcrossing M. guttatus as a 
              function of the observed floral variation.  This two-species  comparison will
              examine the relationship between the mating system  and the genetic basis of
              the observed inbreeding depression, thus  providing baseline information on the
              genetics driving changes in  mating systems in natural plant populations.  The
              results generated  from the research on these two related species will provide 
              insights into preserving both crop gene pool diversity and rare  species
              genetic diversity.***
