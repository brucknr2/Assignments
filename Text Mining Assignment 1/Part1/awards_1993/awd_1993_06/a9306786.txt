Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award will allow the PI to do a combined               
              experimental and theoretical study of the various viscoelastic                 
              and non-Newtonian effects of synovial fluid on joints.  It will                
              give the PI the opportunity to extend her area of expertise in                 
              constitutive modeling of biological fluids into the analysis of                
              synovial fluids for joint lubrication.  The results of this study              
              will provide new methods to study lubrication properties of                    
              joints and may lead to the development of biological substitutes               
              for pathological lubrication fluids.
