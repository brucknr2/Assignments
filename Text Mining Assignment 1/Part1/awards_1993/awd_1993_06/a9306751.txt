Abstract    :
              9306751  Lifschitz       The goal of this research is to develop and study
              high-level  declarative languages designed specifically for describing action 
              and change.  The available methods for representing properties of  actions in
              logic will be characterized as translations from high-  level languages into
              monotonic or nonmonotonic logic-based  formalisms.  The claims that these
              methods are adequate will be  stated as soundness or completeness properties of
              the corresponding  translations, and the validity of these claims will be 
              investigated.  Methods for describing nondeterministic actions will  be
              developed, and their adequacy will be investigated in a similar  way. 
              Competing methods (using different ontologies of action or  different
              nonmonotonic logics) will be compared by studying the  high-level languages to
              which they are applicable.  Translation of  high-level action languages into
              traditional programming languages  will also be studied.  This will allow the
              application of software  tools developed for program verification to the
              automation of some  forms of common sense reasoning.
