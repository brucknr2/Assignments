Abstract    :
              This is a research planning grant to study the interaction of human            
              central nervous system neurons with rat glia in defined medium in              
              culture.  The effects of cellular interaction in these co-cultures             
              will be studied by monitoring glial proliferation and                          
              differentiation when neurons are added to mixed glial cultures.                
              This will be assayed by immunocytochemistry with cell-specific                 
              monoclonal antibodies.  Transmission electron microscopy will be               
              used to document the extent of the glial-neuronal interaction in               
              the co-cultures and to document the presence of myelin.  Antibodies            
              against a neuronal protein which acts as a glial mitogen will be               
              added to the co-cultures to document perturbations in the glial-               
              neuronal interactions.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This work is important because little is known about the                       
              development of myelin in the human brain.  Myelin is a fatty                   
              covering around axon; without myelin, animals have difficulty in               
              moving, in sensory perception, and ultimately in living.  It has               
              been hard to study the development of human brains because until               
              now there has not been available sufficient numbers of mature human            
              neurons for investigation.  These co-cultures use human neurons                
              derived from a brain tumor along with other brain cells, called                
              glia, from immature rats.  In this way, we can study how human                 
              neurons interact with glia to set up normal brain cellular                     
              interactions by examining at a molecular level the process of                  
              myelination.
