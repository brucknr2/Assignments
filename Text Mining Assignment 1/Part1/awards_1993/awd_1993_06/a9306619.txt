Abstract    :
              9306619  Renfro    Inorganic phosphate is an important part of cells as well as
              body  components such as bone.  The amount of phosphate within an  organism can
              alter bodily calcium balance, acidity of body  fluids, and growth.  Phosphate
              regulation is, therefore,  important in all vertebrates.  Dietary intake,
              intestinal  absorption and renal excretion determine the body phosphate 
              balance.  The processes in the kidneys which control the  excretion of
              phosphate are not understood in animals such as  birds and fishes.  Unlike
              mammals, the latter have a mechanism to  transfer phosphate directly from blood
              to the urine through  kidney cells.  The objectives of this work include the
              study of  the mechanism of phosphate transfer at both the cellular and cell 
              membrane levels.  Regulation of phosphate excretion by the  kidneys involves
              the interaction of hormone, acid-base balance,  and dietary phosphate
              availability.  We will examine the basic  cellular processes by which these
              factors alter body phosphate.  ***
