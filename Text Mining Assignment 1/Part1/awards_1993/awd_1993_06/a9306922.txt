Abstract    :
              The specific aim of this research planning grant for women is to               
              identify and subsequently characterize cytochrome P450 enzymes                 
              expressed during murine embryonic development.  This will be                   
              accomplished initially by screening tissue sections of mouse                   
              embryos using in situ hybridization and radiolabeled probes                    
              encoding known P450 enzymes.  Probes that hybridize specifically               
              will be used to characterize the temporal pattern and cellular                 
              sites of expression of P450 transcripts during embryogenesis.                  
              Identification of specific hybridizing transcripts will be                     
              accomplished using techniques such polymerase chain reaction,                  
              molecular cloning and sequencing.  Once cloned, endogenous P450                
              transcripts can be expressed in host cells and the functional                  
              activities of specific murine P450 gene products can be                        
              characterized.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The purpose for carrying out these studies is to identify chemicals            
              produced by embryos that are important in regulating normal                    
              developmental processes.  It is proposed that the production and               
              degradation of such regulatory compounds involves members of a                 
              large family of enzymes known as cytochrome P450 which metabolize              
              a wide range of chemical compounds in almost every tissue of the               
              body.  By utilizing a plethora of available molecular tools to                 
              study P450 enzymes, it should be possible to identify and then to              
              characterize the functional activities of those P450 enzymes                   
              expressed during embryogenesis.  This knowledge will provide                   
              considerable insight into which endogenous compounds or chemicals              
              are produced by embryos and what role they might play in regulating            
              normal fetal development.
