Abstract    :
                   The research entails the geometric inequalities in the                    
              theory of convex sets and methods of geometric measure theory.                 
              Such techniques have applications to the equilibrium shape of                  
              crystalline structures possessing minimal surface area and                     
              lattice spin systems.  Such phenomena are actively studied in                  
              materials theory.
