Abstract    :
              ISSAC is the premier annual conference of the computer algebra                 
              community.  Developing a symbolic computation system raises                    
              many interesting theoretical issues in both computer science                   
              and mathematics, and the ISSAC conferences have traditionally                  
              been a meeting ground for implementors and theoreticians.                      
              Furthermore, as symbolic computation systems have become more                  
              sophisticated, their users have responded by employing them in                 
              more complex ways.  The ISSAC meetings have provided a                         
              scientific forum for beneficial interaction between the                        
              designers of symbolic systems and the users of them.  So not                   
              only are the theoretical computer scientists and systems                       
              implementors present, but so are very mathematically                           
              sophisticated physicists, engineers, astrophysicists,                          
              geophysicists, and other mathematical scientists.                              
                                                                                             
              This grant is to support the travel of American students and                   
              researchers to participate in this conference.
