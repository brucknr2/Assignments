Abstract    :
              This grant is for the partial support of the Twelfth U.S.                      
              National Congress of Applied Mechanics to be held during June 26-              
              July 1, 1994 at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA.  The                
              Congress will provide a forum for the presentation of state-of-                
              the-art research findings in the entire area of applied mechanics              
              to a large audience of leading active workers in that field from               
              academe, government laboratories and industry.  This Congress is               
              the twelfth in a series of such Congresses that started in 1950.               
              They are held once every four years at different locations in the              
              U.S., and are attended by eminent researchers from all over the                
              world.  The gathering of these individuals at the Congress will                
              allow for personal interactions that will provide exchange of                  
              information and ideas, and the possible formation of new research              
              groups, in a variety of disciplines.  Proceedings of the Congress              
              will be published and will thus be available as an archival                    
              resource for future use by the engineering, science and                        
              technology communities.
