Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this award is to support a conference at the               
              University of Missouri on the interaction of Functional Analysis,              
              Harmonic Analysis, and Probability Theory.  Proceedings of the                 
              conference will be published.                                                  
                   The core topic of the conference is Banach space theory,                  
              which is that part of mathematics that attempts to generalize to               
              infinitely many dimensions the structure of 3-dimensional                      
              Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The axioms for the distance                   
              function in a Banach space are more relaxed than those for                     
              Euclidean distance (For example, the "parallelogram law" is not                
              required to hold.), and as a result, the "geometry" of a Banach                
              space can be quite exotic.  Much of the research in this area                  
              concerns studying the structure theory of Banach spaces.
