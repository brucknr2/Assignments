Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed research is to determine whether            
              faithful organ-specific patterns of tomato gene expression can be              
              reproduced in a transient assay system.  If so, the functional                 
              analysis of promoter elements believed to control transcription                
              during development and differentiation will be tested.  A number of            
              conserved DNA-sequence motifs have been identified in the promoters            
              of the five gene encoding the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-                   
              bisphosphate carboxylase in tomato.  Many of these motifs interact             
              with proteins, and patterns of protein binding to the promoters                
              change in correlation with organ specific and developmentally                  
              regulated changes in transcription.                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              The fidelity of organ-specific and developmentally regulated                   
              expression will be tested in the transient system using several                
              promoters whose expression patterns are known. A carefully                     
              characterized transient assay system such as this would be                     
              extremely useful for analysis of gene expression in tomato.
