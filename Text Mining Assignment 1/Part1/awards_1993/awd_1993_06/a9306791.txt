Abstract    :
              9306791  Maynard    This project will study a range of interface phenomena using
              novel  experimental research which takes adantage of the ultra-high  purity,
              well documented properties, and favorable acoustic  characteristics of liquid
              helium.  Other contemporary topics in  dynamics, such as superdiffusion, noise
              and localization in  mesoscopic electronic systems, will be studied with
              acoustic  analogs.  The interfacial pehnomena to be investigated include  fluid
              interfaces, film rupture, cavitation, fluid jet breakup.   These phenomena are
              scientifically interesting because they involve  the fundamental effects of
              systems in metastable equilibrium  approaching true equilibrium through
              hydrodynamic instabilities,  nonlinear dynamics or dynamics on a molecular
              level.  %%%  This project uses ultrapure liquid helium as an acoustic medium to
               investigate a number of fluid interface problems that bear on many  practical
              problems, including foam production, emulsions, spraying  mixing, cavitation,
              lubrication, ultrasound applications, as in  medicine, and others.  The project
              also involves novel acoustical  models of electronic phenomena occuring in
              semiconductors, metals  and other materials.  The acoustic measurements can
              shed light on  the quantum phenomena in a way not possible using other
              techniques.  ***
