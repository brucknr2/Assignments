Abstract    :
                   Penney will continue his investigation to determine what                  
              aspects of the harmonic analysis of Hermitian symmetric spaces                 
              generalize to non-symmetric situations.  Particular questions yet              
              to be resolved are (a) how to characterize the Poisson integrals               
              of hyperfunctions on the boundary and (b) how to treat unbounded               
              domains.  The first step will be to determine if there exist on a              
              bounded homogeneous domain a system of differential operators                  
              which annihilates the Gindikin-Poisson kernel.                                 
                   The basic idea behind Penney's project can be seen already                
              in the motion group of the line, which consists of translations                
              and reflection about zero.  The quotient of the motion group by                
              the reflection subgroup is naturally isomorphic to the line.                   
              Similarly, more general geometric objects can be realized as the               
              quotient of a transformation group by a certain subgroup.  This                
              introduces natural classes of group invariant operators on the                 
              geometric space, and analysis is developed using eigenfunctions                
              of the group invariant operators.
