Abstract    :
              9306650  Yin      Phormia regina, the common black blowfly, has been used 
              extensively to study various aspects of biology from feeding  behavior to egg
              development.  It is common knowledge that  many adult insects need a protein
              meal before they can  develop eggs. What remains to be understood, however, is
              how  this happens or, more aptly put, "What is the link between  nutrition and
              egg development."  Previous research by the  group has shown that there is a
              midgut hormone that provides  this link.  The current study is designed to
              purify and  identify this hormone.  Once this has been done, a test will  be
              developed permitting the determination of the levels of  this hormone in the
              insect's blood following a protein meal.  Finally, the PI will use another test
              to determine where  this hormone is produced and its site of action. The major 
              significance of this research is that this new hormone may  provide a new and
              novel way to interfere with and prevent  egg development.  Such a technique
              should serve as an  exemplar model for controlling egg development in other 
              insects. ***
