Abstract    :
                   Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Complex Analysis                        
              Investigation is proposed in differential geometry, geometric                  
              several variables, and methods of partial differential equations               
              in geometry, including the following specific topics:  The                     
              Bergman metric geometry of pseudo-convex domains, compact                      
              manifolds of non-negative curvature, non-compact manifolds of                  
              non-negative curvature, the spectrum of the Laplacian, and the                 
              geometry of orbifolds.  The overall research thrust of the                     
              project is the study of the relationship of the concept of                     
              curvature to the global geometry, topology, and analysis of                    
              Riemannian manifolds via geometric, complex analytic and partial               
              differential                                                                   
              equation methods.
