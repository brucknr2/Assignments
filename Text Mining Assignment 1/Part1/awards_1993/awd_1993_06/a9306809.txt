Abstract    :
              Jon A. Wellner will carry out research on empirical processes,  bootstrap
              methods in statistics, semiparametric models, and  inverse problems and
              nonstandard asymptotics.  The research will  involve limit theory for infinite
              - dimensional M - estimates and  related bootstrap methods, preservation
              theorems for uniform  Donsker classes of functions, uniform in $~P~$ bootstrap
              limit  theorems, estimation of monotone and convex functions,  convergence of
              iterative convex minorant algorithms, and the  behavior of global functionals
              in models with interval censoring.   Applications include bivariate models with
              covariates, regression  models under interval censoring, and studies of
              nonparametric  maximum likelihood estimators.   Jon A. Wellner will carry out
              research in statistics.  The  research will involve large sample limit theory
              for new  estimators in problems with large (infinite - dimensional)  parameter
              spaces.
