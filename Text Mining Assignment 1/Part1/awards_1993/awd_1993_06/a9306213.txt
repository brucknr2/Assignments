Abstract    :
              9306213  Rocken       This award provides funds for the acquisition of nine
              Global  Positioning System (GPS) receivers by the University NAVSTAR 
              Consortium (UNAVCO). The UNAVCO facility is supported by NSF to  provide
              instrument and logistical support for researchers using GPS  technique in
              investigations of global, regional, and local crustal  motions where maximum
              accuracy (in the millimeter range) of  baseline measurement is required.
              Research projects dependent on  the UNAVCO facility include investigations of
              lithospheric plate  motions, intraplate strain, strain associated with
              earthquakes, and  movement of glaciers.  ***
