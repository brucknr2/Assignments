Abstract    :
                          9306776  Blakeslee  The majority of experiments on visual perception
              have been  concerned with visual thresholds, that is, with measuring the 
              weakest stimulus, for example the intesity of a spot of light,  which is just
              barely visible to human observers.  Most of what is  called "seeing", however,
              corresponds to the neural processing of  stimuli which are very much stronger
              than threshold.  Such stimuli  are referred to as suprathreshold.  If a
              comprehensive scientific  understanding of visual perception is to be achieved,
              then the  study of the response of the visual system to these suprathreshold 
              stimuli is essential.  Of the many types of perceptual experiences  which might
              be studied (e.g., those of stimulus motion,  stereoscopic depth, texture,
              etc.), the goal of the research  planning grant for women is to increase
              understanding of  suprathreshold brightness, contrast and color perception. 
              Whereas  the threshold for a stimulus is relatively unaffected by  surrounding
              stimuli, most visual illusions are based upon the fact  that suprathreshold
              perception is strongly influenced by the  surrounding visual context.  The
              specific purpose of the proposed  experiments is to investigate how the
              perception of stimulus  brightness, contrast and color depends upon surrounding
              stimuli  (i.e., the size and/or shape, luminance and/or contrast, and color  of
              the surround).  ***
