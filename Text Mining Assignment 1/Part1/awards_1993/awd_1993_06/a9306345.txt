Abstract    :
              9306345  Scheraga    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Harold A. Scheraga,
              Department of  Chemistry, Cornell University, to pursue with Professor Mu Shik
              Jhon,  Department of Chemistry, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and
              Technology  (KAIST), and Dr. Kyoung Tai No, Department of Chemistry, Soong-Sil
              University,  Korea, for 36 months, a program of cooperative research on the
              development of  empirical potential functions for protein folding.  This
              theoretical research  is designed to elucidate the energies and mechanism of
              the folding of a  polypeptide chain into the native conformation of a protein. 
              While current  potential functions, developed by the collaborators, are
              sufficiently accurate  for several applications, the collaborators will develop
              new and better  potential functions which will have greater applicability.   
              This research is important for developing a better understanding of the 
              structure and properties of proteins.  The collaborators are highly respected 
              researchers in the field of the proposal.  This project is relevant to the 
              objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to 
              increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and 
              engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and 
              techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean 
              participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering 
              Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an international cooperative dimension 
              to the PI's research under NSF Grant No. DMB-9015815.  ***
