Abstract    :
              9306221  Cary       The project is designed to settle some questions in plasma 
              turbulence which center around the domain of validity of the  quasilinear
              theory.  Recent numerical simulations suggest that  the growth rate of a slowly
              growing turbulent spectrum can be  enhanced over the linear value.  Experiments
              and early  simulations do not exhibit this enhancement.  The numerical work  to
              be undertaken is designed to definitively answer the question  by performing
              numerical simulations using simplistic methods  which are an order of magnitude
              faster than currently available  numerical approaches.  ***
