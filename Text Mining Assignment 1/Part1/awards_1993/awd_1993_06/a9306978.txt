                  This research will (1) characterize natural fluxes of UV B in lakes, and
              (2) experimentally manipulate natural UV B fluxes to resolve how plankton
              communities respond to UV B radiation.  The results of this research will 1)
              establish solid baseline data on the attenuation of UV B radiation in
              freshwater lakes, 2) provide insights into the sensitivity and response of
              plankton communities to UV B fluxes, and 3) provide data on how future
              increases in UV B are likely to interact with other important ecological
              variables such as nutrient limitation and predation. Natural fluxes of
              ultraviolet radiation in the UV B range (280 320 nm) are known to be harmful to
              a wide variety of plants and animals and are increasing globally due to
              stratospheric ozone depletion.  Organisms have already responded to current
              levels of UV B with the production of photoprotective compounds, photorepair of
              DNA, and behavioral avoidance.  Although this response suggests that UV B is a
              potent ecological force, little is known about the ecology of UV B at the
              community or ecosystem levels, or even how far UV B penetrates freshwaters. %%%
              The combination of intensive experimentation in a few lakes, and the sampling
              of UV B and other limnological variables in a broad comparative study of
              numerous lakes, will strengthen our understanding of the role of UV B in
              freshwater ecosystems. ***
