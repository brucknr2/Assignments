              grant is to investigate the use of an amorphous silicon/ferroelectric liquid
              crystal optically addressed spatial light modulator (OASLM) (5) as essentially 
              real time film on which to record the fringe patterns and perform the Fourier
              transform via a coherent optical processor.  Since this device has a frame rate
              of ~3 kHz the PIV optical processor should be capable of 3 orders of magnitude
              speed increase over the best convential electronic processor. ***
