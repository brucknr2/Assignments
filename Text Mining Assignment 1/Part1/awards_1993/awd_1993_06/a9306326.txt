Abstract    :
              A methodology is proposed for deriving equations of motion for interfaces in 
              transition between two phases, such as the solidification of a liquid into a 
              solid, in the asymptotic limit of small diffusion. The investigator will show 
              that the velocity of the interface is a function of its local geometry,
              described  by so-called intrinsic quantities such as the curvature.  This model
              allows the  computation of the radius at which a growing spherical particle
              becomes unstable  and may allow a deeper understanding of the complex dendritic
              structures seen in  solidification.  The problem of the solidification of a
              liquid has many industrial applications,  such as the growing of a quartz
              crystal from a melt for use in semiconductor  devices like computer chips.  For
              these applications it is desirable to grow  smooth, regular crystals.
              Unfortunately, many substances tend to grow into  irregular  snowflake-like
              dendrites.  In this study the investigator proposes a methodology  for reducing
              the complex equations governing solidification to a relatively  simple
              geometric description.  This reduction should allow the prediction of the 
              transition from regular to dendritic solidification.  It may also give some  
              insight into the process by which irregular dendritic structures form and grow.
