              x             9306755 Weller          The proposed research will use both
              molecular and morphological characters to address higher level relationships
              among members of one of the largest moth superfamilies (50,000 described
              species), the Noctuoidea.  The Noctuoidea includes several well known groups
              such as the gypsy moths, tiger moths and woolly bears, and cutworm moths. 
              Despite possession of interesting biological features (e.g. mimicry, sound
              production in tiger moths) and their obvious economic importance as pests,
              several points concerning relationships of these moths remain unresolved.  The
              heart of the problem lies with the cutworm moths; at this time, it is not clear
              whether there is one, two, or several unrelated groups currently lumped into
              the family Noctuidae.  This project will combine molecular  i.e. sequencing one
              nuclear (28B rRNA) and two protein coding mitochondrial (ND1, COI) genes, all
              initially analyzed as independent data sets  with morphological data in a total
              evidence analysis.  The evolutionary trees produced will be used to address how
              the particular proteins evolved and if current models of protein evolution are
              supported by this empirical study. %%%          Both anatomical features
              (morphology) and molecules (gene sequences) will be used to address the higher
              relationships (phylogeny) of the moth superfamily Noctuoidea.  Included in this
              large (50,000 species) group of moths that will be the subject of this study ar
              e several well known groups, many with caterpillars notorious as major insect
              pests (e.g. gypsy moths, tiger moths and woolly bears, and cutworm moths). 
              From this study of higher level group relationships, a more stable
              classification should result that, in turn, will promote future basic and
              applied research with these moths.  In addition, the project will examine how
              protein sequences differ among the major moth groups to learn how the proteins
              themselves have changed over time.  This information will provide baseline data
              for those interested in constructing models of protein change.
