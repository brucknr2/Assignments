Abstract    :
                   The research entails the geometry and topology of hyperbolic              
              structures on 3-dimensional manifolds.  In particular, metrics of              
              non-positive curvature will be studied and the fundamental groups              
              of these manifolds will be related to those of other classes of                
              manifolds.  The techniques exploited may have potential                        
              applications to other branches of mathematics.
