Abstract    :
              9306594  Schewe-Miller    This project is a research planning activity towards
              the  explorative synthesis of new ternary metal-rich compounds M-M'-X  (M,M' =
              transition metals and X = O,S,Se,P, or other nonmetals) and  their structural,
              and physical characterization.  The activities  will include:  1) a critical
              review of literature on the  preparation, structure, and properties of ternary
              transition metal-  rich compounds of nonmetals; 2) high-temperature synthesis
              through  induction heating, arc melting, and indirect resistance heating in 
              tungsten containers; 3) TGA and mass pectrometric analysis up to  2000 K; and
              4) room-temperature X-ray analysis and high-temperature  powder diffraction
              studies (up to 2000 K) with a rotating X-ray  source and a position sensitive
              detector.  In addition, PI will  establish contacts with collaborators, acquire
              training on the use  of experimental methods available at her institution, and
              prepare  a full research proposal for submission to NSF.  ***
