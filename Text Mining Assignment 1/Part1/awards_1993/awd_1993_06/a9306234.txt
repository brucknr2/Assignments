Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports travel expenses for US participation in a                  
              workshop in China for planning a US-China cooperative land                     
              surface - atmosphere interaction experiment to be held in 1996.                
              The workshop will concentrate on finalizing the scientific plan                
              for a study of the grassland ecosystem found in Inner Mongolia,                
              with emphasis on understanding the physical interactions and                   
              feedback processes between the land surface, the vegetation                    
              canopy, the cloud field and the atmosphere.  The study site is                 
              representative of the arid and semiarid temperate grassland zone               
              that is of major importance to global climate.                                 
                                                                                             
              This project is supported under the US-China Cooperative Research              
              Program.
