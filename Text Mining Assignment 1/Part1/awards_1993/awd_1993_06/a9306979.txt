Abstract    :
                   The research entails methods of modelling extra-variation in              
              complex survey data. Approaches include complete probability                   
              distributions with applications to unequal cluster sizes and                   
              longitudinal data. Overall, the intention is to establish models               
              which are applicable to national surveys such as the `High School              
              and Beyond' and `National Crime Victimization Survey' projects.
