Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award is providing Dr. Bertani with an                 
              introduction to the genetic and molecular biological techniques                
              necessary to work with the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces                  
              pombe.  This organism can be easily cultured and manipulated like              
              a bacterium, yet it resembles higher eukaryotes in the regulation              
              of cellular processes like cell division and transcription.  Gene              
              amplification is being studied with the intention of describing the            
              initial events that deregulate normal cellular controls and allow              
              gene amplification to occur at a relatively high frequency.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Gene amplification has been demonstrated in animal cells, but it               
              has been difficult to determine what happens in the earliest stages            
              of that process.  Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a fission yeast that            
              has a wealth of already described mutations affecting many                     
              different cellular processes, and studies of gene amplification in             
              this organism should provide insight into how it occurs in animals.
