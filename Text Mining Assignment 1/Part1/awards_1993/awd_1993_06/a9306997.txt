Abstract    :
              9306997  Evans    In the past ten years, many research groups have found that
              the  mammalian heart and brain produce a family of peptide hormones  which 
              have a variety of effects on the cardiovascular  system  and the kidney. Their
              name refers to the fact that they stimulate  the kidney to excrete salts and
              water. However, it is still  unclear what role(s)  these hormones play in
              humans. Previous  research by Dr. Evans has shown that similar hormones are 
              produced in the fish heart and brain and preliminary evidence  suggests that
              they may be important in cardiovascular physiology  and salt and water balance
              in the se aquatic vertebrates. He  proposes to use the techniques of molecular
              biology to clone the  gene(s) for these fish hormones and initiate a study of
              their  sites of secretion sites of receptors for these hormones, and  their
              role in fish physiology. Such studies will allow him to  study the evolution of
               the form and function of these important  hormones and will allow a more
              precise estimation of their role  in cardiovascular physiology and salt and
              water  balance in  vertebrate animals, including man.  ***
