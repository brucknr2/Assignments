Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a ROW Career Advancement Award.  The goal of this research             
              is to study the role of cyclic AMP (CAMP) in regulating                        
              intracellular communication during growth, differentiation and                 
              regression of corpora lutea.  The immediate objectives are to study            
              (1) ontogeny of contact-dependent intercellular communication among            
              luteal cell types, and (2) effects of regulators of CAMP (e.g.                 
              luteinizing hormone, forskolin) on intracellular concentrations of             
              CAMP and contact-dependent intercellular communication in selected             
              luteal cells during luteal growth, differentiation and regression.

              This is a Career Advancement Award which is one of the Research                
              Opportunities for Women activities of the National Science                     
              Foundation.  The main research interest of the awardee is the                  
              regulation of the function the corpus luteum of domestic animals,              
              with emphasis on interactions among luteal cells during luteal                 
              growth, development, and regression.  This is an important problem             
              in reproductive physiology.  This award will contribute to the                 
              advancement of the awardee's scientific career as well as to basic             
              knowledge of the reproductive biology of domestic animals.
