Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor Robert D. Bach at Wayne State University to study the                
              structures and reactivities of alkyl peroxides, metal                          
              hydroperoxides, peroxy acids, dioxiranes, and carbonyl oxides by               
              high level ab initio methods. Specifically, the oxygen atom                    
              transfer from peroxyformic acid, dioxirane, carbonyl oxide,                    
              peroxide, and vanadium peracid to ethylene and other molecules                 
              like ammonia, phosphine, and sulfides will be analyzed. Emphasis               
              is given to the solvent and substituent effects on these                       
              transitions and their influence on the biradical states and                    
              isomerizations. The study will address the Sharpless epoxidation.

              In this project Dr. Robert Bach will conduct computational                     
              studies to address fundamental aspects on oxidation reactions.                 
              His high level ab initio approach aims to provide insight into                 
              the structures, electronic properties, and solvent effects on the              
              oxygen atom transfer reactivities  of alkyl peroxides, metal                   
              hydroxyperoxides, peroxyacids, dioxiranes, and carbonyl oxides.                
              These studies aim to advance the understanding of metal catalyzed              
              oxidations that are ubiquitous in industry, organic synthesis,                 
              and biochemistry and may lead to more environmental benign                     
              processes.
