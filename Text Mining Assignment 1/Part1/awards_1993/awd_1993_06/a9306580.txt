Abstract    :
              9306580  Nau       This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing 
              award.  A primary goal of the proposed work is to define, analyze,  and
              explicate features of the design of HTN planning systems.  The  proposed work
              will have the following benefits:  It will correctly  characterize HTN planning
              and provide a framework which accounts  for many features used in existing
              planning systems, but not yet  completely formalized (including reduction,
              critics, commitment  choices and filter conditions).  It will provide a clear 
              understanding of the efficiency and expressivity of HTN planning,  and how
              these compare with the efficiency and expressivity of other  approaches to
              planning (such as planning with STRIPS-style  operators).  It will provide ways
              to determine whether a given set  of methods and critics correctly describe the
              planning problem they  were meant to solve.  It will describe the
              characteristics of  planning domains in which HTN planners can operate
              efficiently, and  develop efficient planning systems for those domains.
