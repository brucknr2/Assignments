Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Ribet to work in            
              number theory.  Since 1986, Ribet has been working on Serre's                  
              conjectures which relate mod p modular forms and mod p two                     
              dimensional representations of the Galois group of an algebraic                
              closure of the rationals.  Ribet also proposes to continue his                 
              interests in variants involving Shimura varieties, base fields                 
              other than the rationals and representation modulo powers of p.                
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
