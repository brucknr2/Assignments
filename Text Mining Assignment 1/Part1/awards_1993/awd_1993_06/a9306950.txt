Abstract    :
              The research entails investigating the conformal transformations  of self-dual
              metrics and affine structures on quaternionic  manifolds.  The methods entail
              those relating to self-dual  connections on vector bundles over 4-manifolds and
              the associated  complex manifold or twistor space.  The underlying concepts are
               extendable to higher dimensions via the quaternionic setting.  This research
              has a number of ramifications to general relativity  theory, quantum gravity
              and other areas of mathematical physics.
