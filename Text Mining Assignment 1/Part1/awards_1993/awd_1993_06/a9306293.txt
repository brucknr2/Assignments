Abstract    :
              9306293  Kirk  Silicon heterostructures, such as Si/ZnS, represent new
              directions for increasing the functional density of electronic systems through
              novel nanoelectronic  device designs. In addition to single junction
              heterostructures, we propose investigation double and multilayer
              heteorstructures of the type ZnS/SiZnS/Si both experimentally and
              theoretically.  The main efforts will go toward the determination of the
              physical conditions necessary for epitaxial growth of both ZnS onto Si as well
              Si onto ZnS.  Once grown, the epilayers will be studied to determine their
              electronic transport, defect or dopant incorporation, interface conditions, and
              other characteristics (e.g. band offsets) which would affect device behavior. 
              The growth of monocrystalline heterostructure layers of Si/ZnS will be done
              with molecular beam epitaxy in the first stage of the project. In later stages
              of the project, atomic layer eptitaxy will be developed since it offers greater
              potential for producing higher quality materials.  To assist the experimental
              growth and processing work, theoretical band structure KKR calculations will be
              employed to determine bandgap line-ups, which will help refine and improve the
              growth conditions.  ***
