Abstract    :
                        9306521  Bloom  In a chilling-sensitive tomato cultivar (Lycopersicon
              esculentum  Mill. cv. T5), short exposures to 5 degree centigrade rapidly and 
              irreversibly inhibited root ammonium influx.  By contrast, ammonium  efflux and
              nitrate absorption in this taxon, as well as ammonium  and nitrate absorption
              in a chilling-tolerant congener  (Lycopersicon hirsutum LA1778), recovered
              immediately and fully  from such exposures.  The research would examine the
              physiology and  genetics of this phenomenon to elucidate the regulation of
              ammonium  transport and the importance of ammonium transport in the chilling 
              response of tomato.    The physiological experiments would employ
              ammonium-selective  microelectrodes to localize ammonium absorption in the root
              and to  determine whether resumption of ammonium influx after a chilling 
              episode requires protein synthesis, transcription, or new growth.   These
              characteristics should assist in the identification of root  membrane proteins
              associated with ammonium influx.    The genetic studies would involve the
              screening of 30 plants a day  for chilling-sensitive ammonium influx using an
              automated NH4+  analysis system.  Segregation analysis of the
              chilling-sensitive L.  esculentum, the tolerant L. hirsutum, and L. esculentum
              x L.  hirsutum F1 populations should determine the inheritance of this  trait. 
              Lastly, we would test backcrosses of the F1 hybrids to L.  esculentum that have
              been selected for chilling-tolerant ammonium  influx for their overall chilling
              tolerance.    A better understanding of plant ammonium absorption is critical
              to  the study of plant nitrogen relations in specific, and plant  transport
              processes in general.  Moreover, in transferring a  specific chilling-tolerant
              trait to tomato, we should elucidate the  role of below-ground processes in the
              chilling response of plants.  ***
