Abstract    :
              9306462  Manhart   Among the green algae, both unicellular and multicellular
              forms, there proves to be a greater diversity of genomic structures and
              arrangements than among all the flowering plants.  Some of these genomic
              markers indicate lineages that are the likely close relatives to land plants,
              sharing features of gene arrangement in their chloroplasts and other fine-scale
              genetic structures.  Dr. Manhart at Texas A&M University is studying several
              aspects of chloroplast genome structure and function in green algae in order to
              characterize features that mark particular phylogenetic lineages.  Particular
              attention is focused on organization of the rps12 gene, the presence of introns
              in chloroplast transfer RNA genes, and the presence of introns in the
              photosynthetic gene rbcL. In addition, DNA sequencing will be done for the 16S
              ribosomal gene in order to make comparisons of mutational differences between
              green algae, in order to reconstruct their genealogical connections.  %%%  
              This research involves the use of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) gene sequences and
              fine details of cpDNA organization to test hypothesized phylogenetic
              relationships in green plants and to increase our understanding of the
              molecular evolution of cpDNAs. Aspects of chloroplast structure and function
              should prove useful in delimiting those green algae that are the likely closest
              relatives to land plants.
