               9306795 Bowers          The ralative importance of hostplant chemistry and
              predation in determining foraging patterns of insect herbivores and the degree
              to which these factors intract are largely unknown.  This project will include
              two series of field experiments, with the expression of hosrplant defensive
              chemistry (iridoid glycosides and phenylpropanoid glycosides in    Plantago    
                lanceolata   ) manipulated by using cloned genotypes.  the first set of
              experiments will assess the relative effects of chemical variation in hostplant
              genotypes versus insect predators on the foraging patterns, growth, defensive
              chemistry, fecundity and survivorship of insect herbivores, plus evaluate the
              consequences for the hostplant henotypes and insect predators.  It uses
              hostplant genotypes that vary considerably in their levels of defensive
              chemistry, four caterpillar species that differ in their ability to handle
              iridoid glycosides and two different kinds of insect predators (stinkbugs and
              wasps).  A second series of experiments will focus on the behavior, growth rate
              and survivorship of newly hatched specalist caterpillars determine when they
              induce defensive chemistry in hostplants. %%% Most work on plant herbivore
              relatiosnship hjas focused either on hostplant chemistry or on the role of
              natural enemies in isolation.  The current project examines the interactions of
              these factors.  This is inmportant because it elucidates mechamisms that
              control potential pests of crop or forest plants as well as processes that
              maintain biological diversity of these systems.
