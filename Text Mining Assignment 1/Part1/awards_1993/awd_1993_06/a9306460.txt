Abstract    :
                   Girardi will investigate the internal geometry of Banach                  
              spaces and applications to other areas of analysis.  She will                  
              concentrate on the complete continuity property and its relation               
              to other geometric properties (CCP).  She will also examine the                
              relations between CCP, strong regularity, and the Krien-Milman                 
              property.  She will also continue her investigation of the                     
              Bochner-Lebesgue space.                                                        
                   Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that                      
              attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the                       
              structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The                
              axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more                    
              relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the                    
              "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a result,                
              the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.  Much of                 
              the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory               
              of Banach spaces.
