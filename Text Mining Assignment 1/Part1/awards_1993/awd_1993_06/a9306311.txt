Abstract    :
                   The proposed research concerns investigations into the                    
              Kleinian group aspect of the topology and geometry of hyperbolic               
              structures on 3-manifolds and the geometry of related                          
              Teichmueller spaces.  This is part of a US/Russia collaborative                
              project with A.  Tetenov (Novosibirsk Institute-Russian Academy                
              of Sciences).
