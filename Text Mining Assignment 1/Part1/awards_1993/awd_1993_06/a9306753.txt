Abstract    :
              9306753 Grant          The study of hybridization is important in evolutionary
              biology because it reveals the forces at work in the final stages of
              speciation.  Some populations of animal species commonly hybridize, but it is
              usually difficult if not impossible tho determine the causes and consequences
              of hybridization in nature.  The proposed research takes advantage of an
              exceptionally favorable situation for investigating the causes of hybridization
              and the reasons for relatively high fitness of the hybrids.          On the
              small island of Daphne Major in the Galapagos archipelago the medium ground
              finch, Geospiza fortis, occasionally interbreeds with the two others;
              G.scandens, a resident species, G. fuliginosa, an immigrant.  Pedigree analysis
              has shown that hybrids may survive and breed as well or better than the
              parental species, over several years.  Ecological reasons for their high
              fitness will be investigated by intensive study of feeding efficiencies and
              diets.  Possible advantages arising from enhanced heterozygosity will be
              assessed by an analysis of inbreeding effects in the G.fortis and G.scandens
              populations.  Causes of interbreeding will be identified by statistical
              analysis of mating patterns. %%%          There are basic and applied aspects
              of the proposed research.  Results will be of theoretical importance to our
              understanding of speciation.  A demonstration of the role of hybridization in
              maintaining genetic variation in small and potentially endangered populations
              will be the value to the applied field of conservation biology.
