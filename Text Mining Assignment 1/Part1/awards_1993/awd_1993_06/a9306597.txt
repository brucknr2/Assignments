                Phinney Through the pioneering use of single gene mutants, the PI has defined
              most of the steps in the pathway for gibberellins         ?       biosynthesis
              in maize vegetative shoots.  We have shown that GA   1    is the major
              gibberellin controlling stem elongation in maize and that
              geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) is metabolized to         ? x    
              copalylpyrophosphate (CPP0,    ent    kaurene, GA   12   , and G   1    via the
              early 13 hydroxylation branch pathway.  This proposal describes metabolic
              experiments that will establish five remaining steps in this branch pathway and
              locate the steps blocked by our    d2   ,    d3   , and    anl    mutants.  In
              addition, metabolic studies with five members of a         ? `     second
              branch pathway from GA   12    (the early non 3,13 hydroxylation pathway) will
              assess the importance of this pathway in the control of GA dependent growth in
              maize.  The results from the proposed metabolic studies will provide a detailed
              description of the gibberellin biosynthetic pathways for maize shoots and will
              provide a model for studies with other plants. A search for additional GA
              (dwarf) mutants will be continued: these mutants are being generated by
              transposon tagging using the maize transposable element Ac.  The location of
              the genetic blocks for the  new mutants will be determined form bioassays,
              qualitative analysis of endogenous givverellins, and metabolic studies.  An
              exciting and novel aspect of this proposal comes from the availability of
              transposon tagged dwarf mutants.  The approach provides a convenient method for
              cloning specific genes for GA biosynthesis.  These clones will be used in
              conjunction with conventional methods to isolate the enzymes that control
              specific steps in the biosynthetic pathway. %%%   The objective of the research
              is to understand shoot elongation controlled by the class of plant hormones,
              the gibberellins (GAs).  The strategy is to (i) identify the genes and the gene
              products for these steps in the pathway, and (iii) analyze the enzymes
              controlling these steps, and thereby provide information for the future
              manipulation of plant growth. ***
