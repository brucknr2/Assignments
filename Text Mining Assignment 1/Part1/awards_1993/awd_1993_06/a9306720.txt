Abstract    :
              9306720  Caflisch       Vortical and convective fluid flows are important for a
              wide  range of phenomena, such as fluid mixing, flow around airfoils  and
              obstacles, and turbulence.  In this project the investigator  undertakes
              research in three related topics: (1) Dynamics,  instabilities and singularity
              formation for axisymmetric,  swirling vortex sheets are studied through
              bifurcation analysis  and numerical computation, with applications to vortex
              breakdown.  (2) The effective diffusion rate for a convective flow is studied 
              for flows with randomness and time-dependence. (3) Singularities  are
              investigated for systems of PDE's through a combination of  PDE theory,
              algebraic geometry (catastrophe theory), symbolic  computation, and numerical
              simulation.       The research in this proposal is for analysis and  numerical
              computation of complex fluid flows, such as occur in  many problems of
              scientific and technological importance.   Effective understanding and
              application of these flows requires a  description of both their microscopic
              and their macroscopic  features.  This investigation first focuses on
              singularities as a  fine-scale phenomena in idealized flows.  A macroscopic 
              description of flows is also developed through homogenization of  the
              microscopic variations.  The results from this study will be  important in
              assessing the qualitative features of complex  flows,as well as in the
              development of effective computational  methods.  ***
