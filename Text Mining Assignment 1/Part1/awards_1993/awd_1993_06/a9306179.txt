Abstract    :
              9306179  Kelly       Clonality is an extremely important phenomenon in plants. 
              Clonal plant species  comprise up to 90% of the higher plant species in alpine
              and Arctic communities, 60%  or more of temperate floras, and even in tropical
              habitats, the majority of woody  species possess the ability to sucker, crown
              sprout, or develop adventitious roots.   Clonality is found in trees, shrubs,
              and herbs, under terrestrial, aquatic and arboreal  conditions, and in both
              autotrophic and parasitic groups, yet much about this widely  successful growth
              mode remains poorly understood.  In clonal plants, sugars and  other nutrients
              are transported from 'mother' plants to 'daughter' offshoots (ramets).   Using
              greenhouse experiments to test theory, the research proposed will examine how 
              variation in resource allocation among ramets affects the life history and
              contributes to  the success of different genetic individuals of the clonal
              plant dodder (Cuscuta  exaltata).%%%       Clonal plants have broad economic
              importance as both crop plants (e.g.  strawberries, blueberries, raspberries
              and asparagus) and noted crop pests such as  dodder, which parasitizes crops
              including alfalfa in both temperate and tropical  agriculture.  The information
              provided by this study may prove useful for both crop  growth and pest control,
              offering the data needed to create better schemes for timing  and distribution
              of fertilizers in clonal crops, and reducing the dependence on chemical 
              control of clonal pests.***
