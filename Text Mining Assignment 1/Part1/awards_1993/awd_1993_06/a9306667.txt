Abstract    :
              9306667 Farrell          A phylogenetic study of the 32 subfamilies of the
              phytophagous beetle superfamily Chrysomeloidea (Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae,
              Bruchidae) based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences will be done. 
              Preliminary sequence data have confirmed the utility of the mitochondrial
              cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and the nuclear small ribosomal subunit
              gene (18s) for accomplishing this goal.  Phylogenetic analyses will be carried
              out to determine the relationships among the monophyletic subfamilies within
              each beetle family and the monophyly of the families themselves.  The primary
              goal is to provide a basis for a stable classification that reflects phylogeny.
               This will be achieved by combining analyses of the proposed molecular data set
              with available evidence from morphology.  Secondary goals include evaluation of
              several extant hypotheses concerning the ostensibly relictual affiliation of
              the most "primitive" subfamilies with certain hostplants and eventual tests of
              the potential influences of shifts in resource use among these beetle lineages
              on rates of diversification. %%% This project will use both morphological
              information and new data to be obtained by the Principal Investigator from DNA
              sequencing of both a mitochondrial and a nuclear gene to determine
              relationships and establish a sound modern classification for this large group
              of beetles which includes 32 families in 3 families.  This group or superfamily
              includes over 72,000 species and many of them are important pests of timber,
              agricultural crops and stored grains.  The project will also test current ideas
              on the role of shifts in hostplant affiliations on rates of beetle div
              ersification. ***
