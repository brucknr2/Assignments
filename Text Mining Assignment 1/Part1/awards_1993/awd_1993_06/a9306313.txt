Abstract    :
              9306313  Levine  This proposal concerns the calculation, from first principles,
              of  the linear and non-linear optical properties of semiconductor  crystals
              using ideas based upon band theory but in which the self-  energy corrections
              have been included. The work, to date, has  calculated the dielectric response
              of a range of semiconductors to  high accuracy; the evaluation of the nonlinear
              susceptibility for  second-harmonic generation in several III-V systems and the
               calculation of the optical activity of selenium. The proposed work  will
              concentrate on creating a new GW code; including spin-orbit  effects; studying
              linear and second-harmonic optical response in  technologically relevant
              systems; intercomparing the optical  properties of isolated and solid-state
              condensed molecular systems  and studying higher response functions (eg
              third-harmonic  generation) in silicon.  %%%  This proposal concerns
              principally materials theory; that is the  direct calculation of specific
              materials properties - in this  particular case the optical properties of
              insulating and  semiconducting crystals. The materials of interest vary from 
              technologically important semiconductor device-related materials  (such as
              quartz, strained GaAs and silicon) to biologically  relevant molecular crystals
              (such as urea). The optical properties  of interest range from the linear
              (simple interaction) to the  nonlinear (more complex interaction with light).
              The state-of-the-  art today allows calculation of such properties to a few
              percent  accuracy and indeed allows the prediction of optical behavior in 
              systems which are not-yet made and/or difficult to make. Thus  "materials by
              design" is a viable near-attainable objective for  this work.  ***
