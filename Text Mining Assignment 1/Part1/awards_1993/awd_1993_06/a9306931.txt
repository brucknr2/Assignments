Abstract    :
              9306931  Chan  In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program 
              of the Chemistry Division, Chan will study the pressure  dependence of a number
              of dynamical processes in  low-temperature solids using ESR techniques.  A
              diamond anvil  cell (DAC) will be used to generate very high pressures at 
              temperatures as low as liquid helium.  Processes such as spin  diffusion,
              libration, exciton transport, and reaction rates in  quantum tunneling systems
              will be examined.  Systems to be  examined include organic, biochemical, and
              fullerene molecules.  %%%  In this project Chan will apply high pressure to
              various solids  in order to elucidate the nature of both physical and chemical 
              processes which occur as a result.  The pressure provides a  method of
              modifying distances and orientations on a molecular  level, and thus affects
              dynamic processes such as chemical  reactions.  This work will lead to new
              knowledge and insight  which is unattainable otherwise.  ***
