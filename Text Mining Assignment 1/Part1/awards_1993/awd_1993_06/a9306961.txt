Abstract    :
              James Rusling  Abstract    The goal of this project is an understanding of the
              dynamics of  surfactant microstructures adsorbed on electrodes from 
              microemulsions and their influence on rates of mediated reactions.  
              Electrochemical kinetic studies are used to relate surfactant and  reactant
              adsorption-desorption dynamics on electrodes to chemical  reaction rates. 
              Surface dynamics are measured by time-resolved  flow voltammetry and by
              simplified electrochemical microscopy.  the  adsorption dymanics and reactivity
              of mediators on electrodes are  also obtained.  Using a stirred, batch,
              electrochemical reactor,  the rates of mediated syntheses, measured by
              voltammetry, and of  bulk electrolysis in microemulsions and in isotropic
              solutions are  compared and correlations with adsorption dynamics are sought.  
              Reactions selected for study include carbon-carbon bond formation,  functional
              group deprotection, and production of olefins.   Mediators include
              transition-metal corrins and phthalocyanine an  their derivatives.    Mediated
              electrochemical reactions (reactions involving an  intermediate or catalyst
              that carries the electron (or hole) from  the electrode to the substrate of
              interest) are enhanced by  surfactants adsorbed on electrodes.  Microemulsions
              offer an  attractive way to introduce and control these processes.  This 
              approach can provide clean, efficient, cost-effective processes for  producing
              high-value-added chemical products such as drugs and  dyes.
