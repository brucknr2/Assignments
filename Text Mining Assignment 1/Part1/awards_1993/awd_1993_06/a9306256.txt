Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for                                        
              preliminary research and planning activities                                   
              involved in determination of the feasibility                                   
              of a process to remove trichloroethylene from                                  
              groundwater contaminated with this organic                                     
              solvent.  The proposed process involves use                                    
              of a reactor that incorporates a hollow fiber                                  
              membrane contactor for removal of the                                          
              trichloroethylene from the contaminated                                        
              water, concentration of this contaminant in                                    
              an aqueous phenol solution followed by                                         
              biotreatment in a suspended growth                                             
              bioreactor.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was                                         
              submitted in accord with criteria contained                                    
              in the Program Announcement NSF 92-90,                                         
              Research Planning Grants and Career                                            
              Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and                                    
              Engineers.  Results of this project are                                        
              expected to provide guidance necessary in                                      
              development of a competitive proposal for                                      
              conduct of research that would lead to                                         
              engineering design criteria for a process                                      
              that could be utilized in decontamination of                                   
              groundwater.
