Abstract    :
              This career advancement award provides partial support for Dr.                 
              Champness during a sabbatical leave at the John Innes Institute in             
              Norwich, United Kingdom.  Streptomycetes are well-known for their              
              capacity to synthesize a vast repertoire of secondary metabolites              
              (antibiotics).  Besides their commercial importance, the                       
              Streptomyces are interesting for their complex developmental cycle.            
              In the course of this life cycle, antibiotic synthesis is                      
              developmentally regulated.  The objective of the research in this              
              proposal is to define aspects of the global genetic regulation of              
              Streptomyces coelicolor antibiotic synthesis.  The research planned            
              is based on a set of genes, recently discovered in Dr. Champness               
              laboratory, which regulate the expression of antibiotic genes.  The            
              major goal is investigation of the mechanism by which these genes              
              globally regulate antibiotic synthesis.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              This molecular analysis promises to contribute not only to our                 
              understanding of microbial developmental gene regulation, but also             
              to biotechnology.  Understanding of S. coelicolor regulation is                
              highly likely to explain much of antibiotic regulation in other                
              Streptomycetes and Actinomycetes, and thus increase the potential              
              for rational manipulation of production of commercially important              
              metabolites including the many new metabolites that are                        
              continuously being discovered.
