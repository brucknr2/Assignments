Abstract    :
              Funds are being provided for joint sponsorship of a Gordon Research            
              Conference on Coastal Ocean Circulation that will occur on June                
              14-18, 1993 at Plymouth State College, NH.   The program will be a             
              balanced mixture of observations, theory and modeling.  The focus              
              is strongly on physical oceanographic processes.  Conference                   
              participants will include scientists, senior research students,                
              industrial representatives, and governmental program managers                  
              working on the oceanography of continental shelves.  The purpose of            
              Gordon Research Conferences is to provide a setting for stimulating            
              and provocative discussions on topical and promising future                    
              research areas.  Coastal research is a high priority for NSF and               
              other agencies.  The Coastal Ocean Program (CoOP) is a developing              
              global change research program, and a large interagency initiative             
              is in the planning stages.
