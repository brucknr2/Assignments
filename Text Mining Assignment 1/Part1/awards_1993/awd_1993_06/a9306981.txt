Abstract    :
              9306981  Lindroth   Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2  and attendant
              climate change are expected to have significant impacts on forest ecosystems.  
              You understanding of how these changes will affect ecological interactions,
              especially those between trees and tree-feeding insects, is at best
              rudimentary.  Elevated CO2 can markedly alter the foliar chemistry of deciduous
              trees, including reductions in nitrogen and increases in carbohydrates and
              carbon-based secondary metabolites.  These changes alter the performance of
              leaf-feeding Lepidoptera.  CO2 interacts with other environmental factories
              (nutrient availability, defoliation) and possibly with plant genotype affect
              leaf chemistry and insect performance.  This research investigates the direct
              and interactive effects of elevated CO2, resource availability and plant
              genotype on tree-herbivore-parasitoid interacations.  The experimental system
              includes quaking aspen, red oak and sugar maple (which exhibit a range of
              inherent growth rates and shade tolorances), two leaf-feeding insects (gypsy
              moth and forest tent caterpillar) and a gypsy moth larval parasitioid (Cotesia
              melanoscelus).  Carbon-nutrient balance theory provides a framework for
              development of  three major goal associate hypotheses.  These goals are to
              determine effects of elevated CO2 and 1) drought stress, 2) light availability,
              and  3) aspen genotype on tree chemical composition, and consequences for 
              performance of insect herbivores and the parasitoid C. melanoscelus.  %%% 
              Numerous researchers and research agencies have identified studies on
              interactions of plants and herbivores as pivotal in understanding the
              ecological consequences of global change.  This research will help address that
              need.  Special  features of this research include an emphasis on interactive
              effects of CO2 and environmental system, and use of tree and insect species
              that are ecologically and economically important components of North American
              deciduous forests.
