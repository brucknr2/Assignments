Abstract    :
              9306392  Gelbaum  Investigators in the Schools of Chemistry and Biochemistry, 
              Biology, Chemical Engineering, the Research Center for  Biotechnology at the
              Georgia Institute of Technology and the  Institute for Paper Science and
              Technology request funds for  an upgrade of a Varian XL-400, 400 MHz NMR
              spectrometer. At  the present time this is the only instrument on the Georgia 
              Tech Campus that is completely multinuclear and on which one  can reserve time
              for long term multidimensional NMR  experiments. A Varian Gemini 300, 300 MHz
              NMR spectrometer  located in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry is only 
              capable of running lH and 13C spectra and is used so  extensively that time can
              be reserved for only short  periods.  In addition it does not have the
              capabilities  necessary to carry out research in the area of structure and 
              dynamics of biologically important systems. The recent shift  in emphasis of
              several Georgia Tech departments to more  biomolecular related areas make it
              essential that we  increase the capabilities of our instrument to carry out the
               most important multidimensional NMR experiments i.e. TOCSY  and NOESY in 90%
              H2O. The XL-400 NMR, for which we are  requesting an upgrade, serves the entire
              Georgia Tech  community, therefore, a description of all of the research 
              projects that will utilize the new upgrade would be too  extensive for this
              proposal. Some of the research projects  that will require the upgraded
              instrument include the  investigations of: protein structure and folding
              (Briggs),  structure and dynamics of G.G mismatch (Gelbaum), protease  and
              protease inhibitors (Powers), fundamental investigations  of xylanases
              (Ragauskas), NMR studies on mammalian cells  (Sambanis), complexes of
              intercalators with DNA lesions  (Williams) and isolation and synthesis of
              chemotherapeutic  agents (Zalkow).
