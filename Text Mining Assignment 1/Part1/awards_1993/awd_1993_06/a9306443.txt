Abstract    :
              9306443  Agnew       This award provides operations and maintenance support for
              the  Pinon Flat Observatory operated by the Institute of Geophysics and 
              Planetary Physics at the University of California, San Diego. The  observatory
              operates a system of its own crustal strain meters and  tiltmeters and also
              provides the infrastructure necessary for the  geophysics research community's 
              development, testing, and  evaluation of geophysical instruments such as
              seismic sensors,  water vapor radiometers, and Global Positioning System
              receivers.  ***
