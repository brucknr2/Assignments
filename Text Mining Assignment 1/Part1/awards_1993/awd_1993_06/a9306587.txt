Abstract    :
                   The focus of this study is to utilize historical information              
              in order to examine and document relationships between land use                
              and the character of lakewater chemistry and phytoplankton                     
              biodiversity in a suite of 30 lakes.  Three sets of historical                 
              information will be assembled for each of the 30 waterbodies.                  
              The first set of data will consist of a detailed analysis of the               
              siliceous algal phytoplankton flora for each lake for 1934, 1970,              
              1990, and for pre-European settlement.  The floras will be                     
              determined using microfossil remains from lead-210 dated sediment              
              cores.  The second set of data will consist of lakewater chemical              
              analyses from the same time periods assembled from actual                      
              chemical records and/or inferred from paleolimnological inference              
              models.  The third set of data will consist of land use                        
              determinations for each surrounding watershed for 1934, 1970 and               
              1990, derived from high resolution aerial photographs, historical              
              maps and other archived land use records.  The three sets of data              
              will be used to correlate changes in the chemical and biological               
              status of each lake with measured alterations in land use for                  
              three time periods, the arrival of Europeans to the 1930s, the                 
              1930s to 1970s, and the 1970s to 1990s.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              One of the primary causes of anthropogenic stress on aquatic                   
              ecosystems is the increase in solute content of runoff from                    
              catchment basins caused by a change in land use.  Despite this                 
              fact, the impacts that changing land cover patterns have on                    
              receiving waterbodies are poorly understood.  The availability of              
              detailed historical records coupled with the ability to extract                
              data from the sediment record offers a rare opportunity to                     
              analyze the effects of land use on aquatic ecosystems.  A                      
              fundamental understanding of how changes from one type of land                 
              use to another could alter a nearby waterbody would provide a                  
              powerful tool for lake management.  The integration of historical              
              records, as outlined in this study, could serve as a model for                 
              similar projects in other geographic regions.
