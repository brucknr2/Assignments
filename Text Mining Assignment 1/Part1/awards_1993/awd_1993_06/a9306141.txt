Abstract    :
              9306141  Sher   An important prediction of the theory of strong interactions
              (QCD) is the existence of glueballs--strongly interacting particles without
              quarks.  The production rates of various types of glueballs at high momentum
              transfer will be calculated.  Another QCD prediction concerns the decays of
              heavy quark-light quark bound states; all potentially observable two body
              decays of such systems will be investigated.  It has been known for some time
              that quarks and leptons come in families, and it is known that there are only
              three light neutrino's; thus the neutrino of a fourth family must be very
              heavy.  As a result, the charged lepton of the fourth family might be very
              long-lived, with lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds to years.  The
              phenomenological implications of such long-lived leptons will be studied in
              detail, and the other implications of models which contain such leptons will be
              studied.  Finally, high precision electroweak  studies require better knowledge
              of the cross-section for electron-positron scattering in the 1-9 GeV energy
              range,  and the possibilities of CEBAF making such a measurement in the future
              will be investigated.    e proven leadership than Harris in terms of
              representing LBL.  If RHIC representation is most important, followed by
              institutional representation, Nagamiya would be a stronger choice than Harris. 
                       Moniz would much prefer a smaller and wiser committee than is
              presently constituted.  He felt that many of the recent committee did not
              perform to the level that one should expect of NSAC.         r;   7 r4 F(} ~  t
