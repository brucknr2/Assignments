Abstract    :
                      9306518  Petrino  This research planning grant for women examines the
              periodic  release of 17B-estradiol throughout the reproductive cycle of 
              teleosts.  It is crucial for oocyte growth (vitellogenesis) and  appears to
              have a programming role in the regulation of spawning  patterns.  Therefore, it
              is of great interest to investigate the  regulation of its periodic synthesis. 
              The hormonal and molecular  mechanisms of induction, maintenance or regulation
              of enzyme  activity in the steroidogenic pathway during the cyclic spawning 
              activity and follicle development in teleosts are not at all  defined.  This
              project focuses on ovarian aromatase, the enzyme  required for the conversion
              of testosterone to estradiol that is  located in the follicular (granolosa)
              cells surrounding the oocyte.   The specific aims of this preliminary study
              are: 1) to construct a  cDNA library, respresentative of ovarian mRNA from the
              cyclic  spawner teleost Fundulus heteroclitus, and 2) to clone and sequence 
              the cDNA for aromatase using specific probes.  Segmants of the  sequenced
              enzyme can then be used in future studies for generating  radioactive probes
              necesaries to detect the levels of aromatase  mRNA under gonadotropic
              stimulation and follicle development.    Isolating F. heteroclitus aromatase
              cDNA will allow comparison  amoung teleosts species that show a very differant
              pattern in  spawning behavior, and thus it will contribute to a better 
              understanding of the regulatory control mechanisms operating during  cyclic
              reproduction in teleosts.  This inforamtion will be helpful  in an overall
              understanding of ovarian physiology and reproductive  endocrinology in
              vertebrates.  ***
