Abstract    :
              9306393 The major goal of this research is to determine the extent of nonrandom
              fertilization in natural populations of a native rose mallow (Hisbiscus
              moscheutos).  These results will be used to test the hypothesis that male
              fertility is influenced by the outcome of pollen tube competition within
              styles.  Our previous work suggests that pollen tube growth rates differ among
              individuals, and this trait may affect how many seeds a plant sires. 
              Controlled crosses and genetic markers will be used to test this hypothesis. 
              This research represents the first thorough investigation of the potential for
              sexual selection due to post-pollination events in plants. %%% Although our
              work addresses basic evolutionary theory, it also has practical applications. 
              Pollen tube competition has been proposed as a mechanism by which superior
              genotypes can be identified in commercially important species.  This research
              will improve our understanding of whether pollen competitive ability has a
              genetic basis, and whether there is a positive correlation between the growth
              rates of pollen tubes and their sporophytic progeny.  In addition, seed
              companies need more information about the extent to which seed paternity varies
              due to characteristics of particular pollen donors.  Our results have general
              implications for insect- pollinated crops in which pollinators deliver a
              mixture of pollen from several plants to receptive stigmas.
