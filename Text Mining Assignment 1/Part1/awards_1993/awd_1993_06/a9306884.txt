Abstract    :
              This is an award under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research                
              program.  The immediate objective of the project is to test the                
              effectiveness of the yeast NADP/thioredoxin system in activating               
              seed proteins, notably the proteins of flour and soybean.  The long            
              term objective is to develop a safe and inexpensive processing                 
              technology for baking and other industry that uses flour from                  
              wheat, soybean and other seeds.                                                
                                                                                             
              Preliminary studies carried out in the PI's laboratory in                      
              collaboration with the French group yielded an interesting                     
              discovery that the intramolecular disulfide groups of diverse                  
              proteins including a number of commercially important proteins, are            
              reduced (activated) by the indigenous NADP/thioredoxin system,                 
              consisting of NADPH, NADP-thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin.               
              Potential application of the NADP/thioredoxin system ranges from               
              basic biology research to cereal technology to medicine and                    
              nutrition.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Specifically with the SGER award, Dr. Buchanan will determine if               
              the yeast-based NADP/thioredoxin system can be developed into an               
              efficient tool to explore application potential of the thioredoxin             
              technology.  All work up to this point has been done using E. coli             
              system which has proven not appropriate for cereal technology and              
              nutrition applications.
