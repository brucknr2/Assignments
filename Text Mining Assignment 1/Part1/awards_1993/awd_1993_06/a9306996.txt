Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The locus ceruleus is one of the most fascinating structures in the            
              brain.  Named the "blue spot" by anatomists because it is visible              
              to the naked eye in post mortem material, it finally acquired a                
              function thirty years ago when it was discovered that all the                  
              adrenergic fibers in the brain and spinal cord originate from in or            
              near this spot.  That makes the locus ceruleus the central                     
              component of the sympathetic nervous system, regulating states of              
              conscious and the body's response to unusual challenges.  This NSF             
              award will enable 10 young scientists to attend an                             
              interdisciplinary international conference on this structure.  At              
              this conference scientists from many diverse disciplines whose work            
              is relevant to the locus ceruleus will share their findings.  The              
              results will be published in a book that will serve as a resource              
              for scientists unable to attend the meeting.***//
