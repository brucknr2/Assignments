Abstract    :
              9306252  McGhee  This is a three-year cooperative experimental  research program
              involving the Naval  Postgraduate School (NPS) in the United  States and
              Institut National de Recherche en  Informatique et en Automotique (INRIA) in 
              France.  On the U.S. side, the principal  investigators have many years'
              experience  with robotic vehicles, and currently operate  an advanced
              autonomous underwater vehicle  (AUV) in a test pool environment on a routine 
              basis.  On the French side, INRIA supports a  major laboratory in Sophia
              Antipolis  concentrating on both mobile and fixed-base  sensor-controlled
              robots.  Their work has led  to a three level software architecture for  robot
              control surprisingly similar to an  architecture which has been developed at
              NPS  for AUV control.  It is desired by both INRIA  and NPS to conduct a
              cooperative experimental  study involving a comparison of these two 
              architectures, and to combine the best  features of each to produce a new 
              architecture to enable more timely, less  costly, and more reliable development
              and  archiving of software modules applicable  across a variety of underwater
              vehicles.
