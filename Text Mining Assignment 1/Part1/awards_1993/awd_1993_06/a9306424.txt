Abstract    :
              9306424  Navia  This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project
              deals with the development of  crosslinked enzyme crystals (CLEC) and their
              catalytic applications to organic synthesis.  Specifically, crystalline
              esterase and lipase enzymes will be crosslinked with glutaraldehyde to  form
              immobilized enzyme particles which can be lyophilized and stored. These CLECs
              will  remain catalytically active and retain their mechanical integrity under
              harsh manufacturing  conditions. CLEC particles are individual crystals and
              will not require inert support structures.  Their well-defined facets will
              promote the formation of monodisperse suspensions that will  facilitate the
              scale-up of enzyme-based processes to commercial volumes, particularly in
              organic  solvents. The research will focus on CLECs of lipase and esterase
              enzymes used by the chemical  industry in the manufacture of chiral
              intermediates and pharmaceuticals.  %%%  This SBIR Phase II project will
              continue the advances initially started in the Phase I studies. An  important
              goal of the SBIR Program is the ultimate conversion of NSF-supported research
              into  technological innovation and commercialization.  ***
