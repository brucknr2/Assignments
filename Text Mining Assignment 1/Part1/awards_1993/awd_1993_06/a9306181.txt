Abstract    :
                   The Theoretical Advanced Study Institute in particle                      
              physics will operate each summer during the period 1993 -                      
              1997 at the University of Colorado.  This Institute is a                       
              summer school which provides advanced training to students                     
              of elementary particle theory.  It provides a much needed                      
              bridge between courses offered in universities and the                         
              expertise required for research at the frontiers.  The                         
              topics for any given year are organized by the program                         
              leaders for that year, with help from the Scientific                           
              Advisory Board.  The emphasis each year is on timely                           
              subjects which are relevant for both theory and experiment,                    
              and the lecturers are typically of excellent quality.
