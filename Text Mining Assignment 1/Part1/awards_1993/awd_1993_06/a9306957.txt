Abstract    :
                Lin  This work continues research into the collision of electrons with 
              excited metastable atoms such as He.  Measurements of total  cross sections
              from these difficult to produce beams are used to  elucidate the differences in
              collisions between atoms in their  ground and excited states.  New techniques
              will be developed to  increase beam densities and to detect radiation from the
              various  sublevels excited by the impacting electrons.  The cross sections 
              which are to be measured are needed for numerous applications to  discharges,
              lasers and plasma processing of materials.
