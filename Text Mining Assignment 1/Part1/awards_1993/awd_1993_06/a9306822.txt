Abstract    :
              This project will investigate approximation schemes for                        
              geometric objects.  The geometric objects considered are                       
              Euclidean Networks and Polyhedra.  Euclidean networks have                     
              diverse applications, such as in modeling geometric networks                   
              and circuit interconnections.  Polyhedra are used to model                     
              almost any real space filling object, such as machine parts,                   
              automobiles, and robots.  The complexity of algorithms that                    
              manipulate these geometric objects often depends upon the                      
              complexity of the objects themselves.  The approximation                       
              schemes to be studied will attempt to replace the original                     
              objects by simpler ones such that relevant properties of the                   
              original objects are retained by the simpler objects.  The                     
              hope is, later computations get sped up.                                       
                                                                                             
              For dense Euclidean networks, a subset of the edges will be                    
              eliminated in such a manner that in the sparser network                        
              communication paths between any pair of vertices is not                        
              appreciably lengthened.  For polyhedra, the surface will be                    
              replaced by a simpler one containing fewer planar pieces, yet                  
              retaining important original properties.
