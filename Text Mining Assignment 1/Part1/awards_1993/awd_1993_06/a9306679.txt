Abstract    :
                   This proposal will use grid-based statistical data to develop             
              a model that explores the integration of local plant interactions,             
              community development, and ecosystem processes.  Analyses will                 
              involve data from a gridded plot on Mt. St. Helens during recovery             
              from the eruption, 1983-1993.  Growth, survival, and reproduction              
              of individual plants of various species will be used to construct              
              a computer simulation model on a cellular grid that represents                 
              local plant interactions.  Manipulation of significant influencing             
              factors will indicate the degree to which these factors affect                 
              community development and ecosystem processes, such as nitrogen                
              fixation.  These simulations will be compared to observations of               
              plants in the field during this award period as a means of model               
              evaluation.

                   Understanding the relative contributions of various                       
              environmental factors to local plant population dynamics and                   
              interactions, community development and ecosystem processes during             
              recovery from disturbances is major goal of ecological study.  The             
              linkage between population, community and ecosystem processes has              
              become a particularly important topic as the functional importance             
              of biodiversity, population interactions, and community development            
              to ecosystem function and recovery from disturbance has been                   
              recognized.  This research will link field observations and                    
              simulation modeling to develop an ecological framework for                     
              integrating these processes and levels of organization.
