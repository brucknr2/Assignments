Abstract    :
              9306240  Raymond       Frank Raymond has refined a theory for generalized
              Seifert  fiberings modelled on principal G-bundles to include arbitrary  Lie
              groups G.  Applications and examples illustrating how the  general theory
              differs from the case where G is abelian or  nilpotent have been developed and
              will be put into final form.   Techniques and results from Seifert fiberings
              will be used to  investigate space form problems for the pseudo-Riemannian 
              manifolds of constant curvature and their frame bundles.   Elliptic surfaces
              whose Euler characteristic are zero support  4-dimensional geometries.  A
              Teichmueller theory for these  geometries and the moduli of isometry classes
              will be constructed  and determined.  G. Peter Scott plans to work in three
              main  areas:  Firstly, he will continue his work on the topological  rigidity
              of 3-manifolds.  Secondly, he plans to work in the area  of 3-dimensional
              Poincare duality groups.  The long term aim here  is to show that any such
              group comes from a 3-manifold, but he  will restrict his attention to those
              groups which 'ought' to  correspond to Seifert fiber spaces or to Haken
              manifolds.   Thirdly, he plans to extend to higher dimensions his work 
              generating the characteristic submanifold of a 3-manifold.       Manifolds are
              natural geometric objects like circles  and spheres and doughnuts that can be
              described locally by the  same type of coordinates as a Euclidean space of the
              same  dimension.  Their variety and complexity increases rapidly as the 
              dimension increases, but some of the most intractable problems  arise already
              in dimensions three and four.  That we live in a  world of three dimensions, or
              four if time is considered, makes  this of more than purely academic interest. 
              Cosmologists do not  know which 3- or 4-manifold constitutes the physical
              universe, so  studying the possibilities that can occur has ample motivation.  
              These two investigators are making ingenious use of geometry and  of algebra to
              shed light on the question.  Their work w ill also  enrich the arsenal of tools
              available to others for studying  low-dimensional manifolds.  ***
