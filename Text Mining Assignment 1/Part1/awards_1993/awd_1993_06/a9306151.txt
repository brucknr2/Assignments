Abstract    :
              9306151  Kritz       Because their chemical sources and sinks are negligible and
               their physical source and removal mechanisms generally well  understood,
              natural and artificial radionuclides have played a  unique and valuable role in
              tracing atmospheric motions and  transports.  Most recently, with the emergence
              of global  circulation models (GCMs) there has been a growing realization of 
              the important role these radionuclides can play in developing and  validating
              these models, which are a key element in current  attempts to understand and
              model climatic change.  However while  several current GCMs have incorporated
              radionuclide such as 222Rn,  210Pb, 7Be and 85Kr, comparing model predictions
              with observations  to evaluate model performance, the application of this
              approach is  severely limited by the absence of a free tropospheric
              radionuclide  data base.  This research program is designed to obtain a 
              statistically significant series of summer and winter vertical  profiles of
              222Rn, and ozone in the mid-latitude northern  hemisphere.  These profiles,
              which will extend from the boundary  layer to the tropopause will be of
              considerable value in refining  and testing global circulation and climate
              models.  Approximately  16 profiles will be obtained piggybacking aboard the
              NASA Kuiper  Airborne Observatory (KAO), a  C-141 aircraft which carries a
              large  infrared telescope.   The KAO makes about 100 flights a year,  climbing
              to 41,000 ft to get above the dust and water vapor which  would interfere with
              its astronomical observations.  This  researcher has been flying
              measurement-based experiments on the KAO  since 1983, and has recently
              completed construction of a fast  sampling system, which is ideal for
              collecting samples for 222Rn  analysis during the normal ascent and descent of
              this aircraft.
