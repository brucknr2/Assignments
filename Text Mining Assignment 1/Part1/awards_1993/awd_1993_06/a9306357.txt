Abstract    :
              This project continues a study of structured computational problems and 
              asynchronized iterative algorithms.  The study includes questions related to
              the  structured perturbation analysis, design of efficient and robust
              specialized  algorithms for given classes of structures, implementations on
              modern high  performance computer architectures and applications to
              computationally intense  real life problems.  Focus will be on the design of
              efficient and robust methods  for specific classes of very large scale
              computational problems coming from  applications in science.  In particular
              such algorithms will be designed for  computational problems arising in nuclear
              scattering.  Results will be applicable to a broad class of problems in science
              and  engineering, and will make effective use of new computational
              architecture.
