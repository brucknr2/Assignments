Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project                                
              involving physicists from the Georgia State                                    
              University and Marmara  University in Istanbul,                                
              Turkey will launch a new full-scale analysis of                                
              many-body effects in atomic photoionization.                                   
              Project funding will enable Dr. Zikri Altun of                                 
              Marmara University to work with Dr. Steven Manson                              
              and his team at Georgia State University.                                      
              Additionally, Dr. Manson will visit Dr. Altun's                                
              laboratory and work with his team.   This new                                  
              collaborative research effort will focus on                                    
              photoionization of open-shell atoms using many-                                
              body perturbation theory with particular emphasis                              
              on the very difficult transition metals and rare                               
              earth elements, and photoionization with                                       
              excitation of closed-shell atoms.  With the                                    
              advent of the new powerful synchrotron light                                   
              sources, these kinds of systems will be more                                   
              readily explored, thus rendering the proposed                                  
              studies quite timely.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project in theoretical physics fulfills the                               
              program objective of advancing scientific                                      
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                   
              United States and Turkey to combine complementary                              
              talents and pool research resources in areas of                                
              strong mutual interest and competence.
