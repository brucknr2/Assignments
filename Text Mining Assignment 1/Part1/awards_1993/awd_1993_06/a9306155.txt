Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three year continuing award.  It                   
              provides funds to support the collaboration of researchers from                
              several U.S. institutions with their counterparts in Europe who are            
              funded by the European ESPRIT program for a project on Geometry-               
              Driven Diffusion in Vision.  The U.S. research groups are led by               
              Pietro Perona (CalTech), Jitendra Malik (University of California              
              at Berkeley), David Mumford (Harvard University), Stephen Pizer and            
              Ross Whitaker (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), and               
              Sanjoy Mitter (MIT).  A number of European investigators are to be             
              involved, from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, Katholieke               
              Universiteit Lueven in Belgium, University of Las Palmas in Spain,             
              University of Paris IX Dauphine in France, the Royal Institute of              
              Technology (KTH) and Linkoping University in Sweden,  and the Swiss            
              Federal Institute of Technology.  Some important research                      
              resultsbased on nonlinear diffusion processes have arisen for early            
              vision tasks.  This consortium is investigating the theory of this             
              approach to image processing, some testbed implementations,                    
              possible applications such as medical image enhancement, and                   
              possible insights into the natural parallelism,                                
              cooperative/competitive mechanisms, and neural feedback mechanisms             
              between layers in the brain.
