Abstract    :
              9306818  Dingle    Because most behavioral variation among individuals probably
              results from  interactions between genes and environments, it is advantageous
              to study the  behavior of different genotypes across a range of environmental
              conditions.  Using  this perspective, Drs. Dingle and Carroll will compare
              social, quantitative genetic,  and populational influences on the tactical
              decisions of soapberry bugs from two  different environments.  Working with an
              insect species permits raising many  generations in a short period of time, and
              so increases the chances of obtaining  reliable results.  Drs. Dingle and
              Carroll will experimentally manipulate the  environments that these animals
              experience to reveal how genes and environment  interact to create behavioral
              differences between populations and among  individuals.    The approach taken
              here exemplifies a new model paradigm for the study of  behavioral evolution. 
              Studies of animal behavior have previously examined  ecological and social
              causes of individual differences, but hardly any have  attempted to analyze how
              genes and the environment (nature and nurture)  influence behavior together. 
              Human psychology is an exception to this  generalization:  By combining
              pedigree information with environmental analyses,  the study of human behavior
              has advanced on levels little explored for other  animals.  Because so many
              individuals can be raised so quickly, and because they  have been found to have
              as much behavioral variation as do other kinds of  animals, insects are
              excellent model organisms for this kind of study.
