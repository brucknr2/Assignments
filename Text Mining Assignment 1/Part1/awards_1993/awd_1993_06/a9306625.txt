Abstract    :
              9306625  Hey       This research asks basic questions about the formation of 
              biological species.  Although it is clear that species formation,  whereby
              single species splits into two, has been a common process  in the history of
              life on earth, we have only limited  understanding of how it occurs.  Dr. Hey
              will study two groups of  species, the Drosophila virilis species group (5
              species) and the  Drosophila pseudoobscura species group (4 species).  Within
              each  group the species are closely related and are genetically  similar.  For
              each group, the basic data are the DNA sequences of  several genes.  These
              genes will be sequenced from each of  several individuals in each of the
              species in each species group.   From the pattern of DNA  sequences variation
              found among  different copies of the same gene,  Dr. Hey will be able to 
              generate descriptions of the history of these genes.%%%       By studying
              several genes and applying newly developed  models of the relationship between
              gene histories and species  histories, Dr. Hey will develop a historical
              portrait of genetic  divergence during speciation within these groups.***
