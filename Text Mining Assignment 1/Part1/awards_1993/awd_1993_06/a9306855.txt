Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will continue long term studies of salt marsh primary             
              production that were begun at North Inlet, SC in 1984.  Existing               
              long-term data on demography (e.g. stem survival, density                      
              dependent growth and mortality, etc.) and productivity of Spartina             
              alterniflora are unique.  Stem populations have been monitored                 
              monthly on permanent plots that were established in two high marsh             
              sites, two low marsh sites, and one experimentally fertilized high             
              marsh site.  There has been significant interannual variation in               
              net aboveground production that appears to be controlled primarily             
              by salinity and sea level anomalies.                                           
                                                                                             
              Existing monthly census of stem populations will be supplemented               
              with measurements of tissue nitrogen, belowground growth and                   
              reserves, and additional sediment chemical parameters (pore water              
              ammonium and sulfide concentrations).  Existing measurements of                
              per water salinity will continue, and necessary climate and tide               
              data will continue with NOAA support under the National Estuarine              
              Research Reserve Program.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Long-term measurements will yield basic information about                      
              interactions between belowground and aboveground processes, and a              
              clearer understanding about the regulation of salt marsh primary               
              production.  The structure nd function of coastal wetlands will                
              change as a consequence of man-made and natural changes in the                 
              environment.  This research will yield data that are directly                  
              relevant to issues of coastal ecosystem management.
