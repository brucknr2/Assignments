Abstract    :
                   The aim of this project is to increase the relatively low                 
              usage of computers in the entire range of upper level physics                  
              courses taken by undergraduate physics majors at schools                       
              across the nation.  A group of 27 physicists has been                          
              assembled to write computer software and associate texts for use               
              in nine advanced undergraduate physics courses.  The                           
              software is intended for use by instructors during in-class                    
              demonstrations and by individual students outside of class.  It                
              will be disseminated in the form of nine short texts and                       
              accompanying diskettes by the publisher John Wiley and Sons.  The              
              project has to-date received NSF yearly funding since                          
              August 1990.
