Abstract    :
              9306891  Croat       Field collecting of plants in native habitats followed by 
              intensive laboratory and herbarium study remain the most efficient  means of
              identifying and classifying the rich plant life of the  tropics.  Dr. Thomas
              Croat of the Missouri Botanical Garden, a  specialist on the aroid or
              philodendron family, is studying the  neotropical genus Dieffenbachia in Mexico
              and Central America, with  an estimated 30-35 species, in preparation for a
              taxonomic  monograph of the group.  The genus includes the second most 
              important species of ornamental plant in terms of commercial sales  in the
              U.S.; however, relationships among species, sources of  germplasm for breeding,
              geographical ranges, and aspects of  pollination and dispersal biology and
              possible hybridization are  poorly known.  Descriptive information about the
              plants, taken from  living material and herbarium specimens, is entered in a
              computer  database, which eventually will be accessible over the Internet to 
              interested researchers and students.  The research will lead to  improved
              diagnosis of each species, a preliminary account of  phylogenetic
              relationships, mapping of geographic ranges, notes on  flowering and fruiting
              phenology and other aspects of ecology, and  identification keys for reliable
              assignment of scientific names.       The inventory of plant diversity in the
              tropics remains an  ongoing endeavor by a small group of devoted taxonomic
              specialists.   The collections they create, both herbarium specimens and living
               material in botanical gardens, and the published information and,  now,
              computerized records, become resources for wise use and  stewardship.
