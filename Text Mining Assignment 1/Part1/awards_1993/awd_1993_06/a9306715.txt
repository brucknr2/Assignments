Abstract    :
                   The human deoxy-uridine triphosphate pyrophosphatase gene will            
              be isolated by cDNA hybridization and then characterized.                      
              Additionally, the protein product will be analyzed for possible                
              phosphorylated isoforms and molecular weights and isoelectric                  
              points determined. The expression of the gene in peripheral                    
              lymphocytes as a function of the cell cycle will also be measured.             
              %%%                                                                            
              The dUTPase enzyme has been associated with a number of cellular               
              processes: DNA replication, cell replication and cell death. An                
              understanding of gene structure and expression as well as more                 
              insight into the structure as related to function of the encoded               
              protein in human cells will be fundamental to any understanding of             
              human cell viability.
