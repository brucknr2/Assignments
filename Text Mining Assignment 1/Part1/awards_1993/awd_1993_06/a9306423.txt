Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Current projections indicate that the partial pressure of CO2 in               
              earth's atmosphere will be double the level of the preindustrial               
              era somewhere between the years 2036 and 2060 resulting in a 20C -             
              30C increase in global temperature.  There is a large uncertainty              
              concerning the quantitative ability of the oceans to absorb                    
              anthropogenic CO2 and the influence the uptake will have on global             
              climate.  A small, low power, low cost, analytical instrument is               
              proposed with the sensitivity, durability, and long term stability             
              to make continuous measurements of the CO2 concentration above and             
              below the oceanic surface for periods of one year or longer without            
              calibration or repair.                                                         
                                                                                             
              During Phase I, prototype CO2 sensors were fabricated and tested               
              with the capability of responding to 100 x 10-12g of CO2.  In                  
              laboratory tests, the prototype sensor was able to measure CO2                 
              levels to 100 ppm in the presence of oxygen and nitrogen gases.                
              Power consumption was measured at 250 uW per sensor.                           
                                                                                             
              During Phase II, high performance sensors will be incorporated into            
              a prototype CO2 monitoring instrument system suitable for                      
              deployment                                                                     
              with existing ocean monitoring and telemetry systems.  Performance             
              of the prototype will be quantified in the laboratory and ocean                
              environment.
