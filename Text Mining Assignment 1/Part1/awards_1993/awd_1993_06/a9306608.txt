Abstract    :
              9306608  Robertson  Phloem-specific protein (p-protein) is a major protein in
              sieve  tube elements, yet the function of this protein is not known.  
              Functions commonly ascribed to p-protein are that it plugs sieve  pore plates
              following wounding and/or that it maintains sterility  in phloem by binding
              microorganisms.  However, the synthesis and  turnover of p-protein are very
              high, characteristics not normally  associated with proteins that are primarily
              structural in nature.  In the electroosmotic flow theory of phloem
              translocation, p-  protein has been hypothesized to have an active role in the 
              transport of photosynthetic assimilates.   Antisense technology to  phenocopy
              null mutations for p-protein isoforms can help to  clarify the role of
              p-protein in translocation.  As the first step  towards this goal, the PI
              proposes to isolate p-protein genes from  tobacco, Arabidopsis and pumpkin. 
              %%%  A long term goal is to monitor changes in translocation flow and in  the
              plant's response to wounding in plants transformed with  antisense p-protein
              mRNA.  These experiments will increase our  understanding of the mechanism of
              phloem translocation and will  help elucidate the function and importance of
              p-protein in normal  plant growth.  The knowledge gained from such studies will
              increase  our basic understanding of phloem tissues and may have important 
              consequences for agriculture.  ***
