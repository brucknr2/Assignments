Abstract    :
              Athanas         Field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices represent a 
              relatively new technology that provides a means of implementing  hardware
              functionality which can be modified under software  control.  When integrated
              into a computing platform these devices  can provide direct hardware execution
              for operations that have  been conventionally evaluated using software.  The
              purpose of  this workshop is to assess the current state of FPGA computing  and
              establish goals for further development of reconfigurable  processing
              platforms.
