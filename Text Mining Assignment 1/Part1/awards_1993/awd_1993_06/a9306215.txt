Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant, made in the                  
              Chemistry Division will allow Dr. Macklin to gather preliminary                
              results and develop a research proposal dealing with the                       
              development of a technique for assay and chemical studies of                   
              aqueous biological substances by microscopic Raman                             
              electrochemical spectroscopy. The technique involves making                    
              micro-Raman measurements on extremely small quantities of                      
              biological materials adsorbed onto a microelectrode. The effect                
              of variables such as solute concentration, electrode                           
              surface,electrode potential, electrode material, pH, and                       
              excitation intensity and frequency on Raman intensity will be                  
              studied.

              This microchemical Raman spectrochemical technique could lead                  
              to the development of biosensors for the assay of extremely                    
              small concentrations of amino acids and small polypeptides,
