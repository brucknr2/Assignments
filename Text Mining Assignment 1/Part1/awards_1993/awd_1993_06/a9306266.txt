Abstract    :
              9306266  Richards       Post-replicative methylation is the most common DNA 
              modification present in eukaryotic cells.  Although DNA methylation  has been
              the subject of intense study, many questions remain about  the function of this
              form of DNA modification in eukaryotes.  The  proposal outlines a genetic
              approach to the study of DNA  methylation using the flowering plant Arabidopsis
              thaliana as a  model.  We have isolated A. thaliana mutants that contain
              reduced  levels of cytosine methylation.  Plans for further characterization 
              of these hypomethylation mutants and strategies for isolating new  methylation
              mutants are proposed.  %%%  It is anticipated that the A. thaliana mutants will
              provide a new  system for studying eukaryotic DNA methylation.  ***
