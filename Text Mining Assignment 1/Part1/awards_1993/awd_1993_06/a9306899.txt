Abstract    :
              9306899  Garfunkel    The purpose of this project is to understand the basic
              metal  overlayer growth dynamics of metal organic chemical vapor  deposition
              (MOCVD) processes on surfaces.  This research includes  an examination of the
              mechanisms involved in the pyrolytic  deposition of transition metal films from
              carbonyl M(CO)x and  trifluorophosphine M(PF3)x precursors on Si, Ni, and thin
              film  SiO2.  Specific issues that will be addressed are:  i) How do 
              organometallic precursors interact and decompose on different  substrates? ii)
              What microscopic structures occur and how do they  evolve during the growth of
              thin metal films? iii) Can one predict  which precursor would be appropriate
              for a desired metallization  process? The metal film growth microstructures
              will be studied  primarily by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and the 
              decomposition mechanism and thermochemistry by a combination of  vibrational
              (HREELS), compositional (XPS and AES), and desorption  (TDS) spectroscopies. 
              MOCVD results will be compared with those  obtained by physical vapor
              deposition (PVD) methods.  Both the  microstructural and thermochemical results
              of this work should add  significantly to the understanding of the science of
              MOCVD and to  the variety of advanced materials applications which utilize thin
               metal films.  ***
