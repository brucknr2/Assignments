Abstract    :
                   This award supports work on the Inverse Galois problem.  The              
              principal investigator will improve the criteria for the                       
              realization of groups as Galois groups that he has recently                    
              found.  He will also search for new criteria and apply these                   
              criteria to realize further interesting classes of groups,                     
              especially simple groups, as Galois groups over the rationals and              
              over cyclotomic fields.  Most of this work is based on the use of              
              moduli spaces for covers of the Riemann sphere.                                
                   A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.                
              It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and               
              chemistry.  One of the major problems in algebra is concerned                  
              with identifying those groups which can be represented as the                  
              Galois group over the rationals.  This involves a blend of                     
              algebra, number theory and algebraic geometry.
