Abstract    :
                   The ecological study of how populations are regulated in their            
              numbers and abundance has moved from single-factor investigations              
              to more complex analyses of multiple factors.  Plants and their                
              insect herbivores present a favorable system for experimental                  
              manipulation in order to tease apart these multiply interacting                
              factors.  Dr. Harrison in a planning grant is studying the western             
              tussock moth that feeds upon lupines across a 1000 km north-south              
              transect.  Competition for lupine herbage as well as predation by              
              ants and other insect predators upon the moth larvae are being                 
              studied through experimental enclosures and other manipulations.               
              Parasitism and insect dispersal are also being monitored in order              
              to construct an abstract model of population regulation, with                  
              identification of differing control points along the north-south               
              climatic gradient.                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                   The complexity of ecological factors affecting the numbers and            
              abundance of organisms makes experimental manipulations challenging            
              but necessary.  Dr. Harrison in a research planning grant is                   
              beginning an ambitious investigation of the western tussock moth               
              that feeds on native lupines in coastal California, along with the             
              ant and other insect predators of the moth, along a 1000 km north-             
              south transect.  One goal is to identify controlling factors in the            
              population regulation of moths that are likely to differ in                    
              different parts of its latitudinal range.
