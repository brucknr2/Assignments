Abstract    :
                   The PI will carry out modeling and diagnostic studies to                  
              investigate the interannual variability and predictability of the              
              monthly and seasonal average circulation of the atmosphere.  The               
              long term goal is to investigate the predictability of the coupled             
              ocean-atmosphere-land system.  To accomplish this objective, the               
              strategy is to utilize realistic models of the individual                      
              components (atmosphere, ocean, and land surface processes) to carry            
              out sensitivity and predictability studies first to examine the                
              predictability of each component separately, and ultimately to                 
              examine the predictability of the coupled interactive system.  The             
              PI and his group will continue their ongoing research on the                   
              predictability of space-time averaged atmospheric circulation to               
              establish a physical basis for, and demonstrate and the feasibility            
              of dynamic extended range forecasting.                                         
                   To accomplish the above objective the PI will continue to                 
              improve the NMC-derived atmospheric general circulation model so               
              that its ability to simulate the annual cycle and interannual                  
              variability including space-time fluctuations is further improved.             
              He will also use this model in conjunction with real conditions at             
              the earth's surface to investigate the predictability of the                   
              regional space-to,e averaged circulation of the atmosphere.                    
                   This research is important because it will provide a readily              
              applied basis for improvements in operational weather and climate              
              prediction models.
