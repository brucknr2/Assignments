Abstract    :
              9300330  Bierzychudek  This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at
               Pomona College to establish a Research Experiences for  Undergraduate Site. 
              The program will provide full-time  summer stipends for eight students, and
              part of semester-  long academic year stipends for 10 more to work jointly with
               faculty advisors on a variety of projects in the biological  sciences,
              including molecular biology, population and  behavioral biology, physiology and
              cell biology.  Support  activities will ensure that students have ample
              opportunity  to develop independence, to discuss their work with one  another,
              and to draw together their results for presentation  to others.  In addition,
              activities are provided to  encourage younger students to consider engaging in
              a  research experience.  Significant numbers of women,  underrepresented
              minorities, and students from schools where  research opportunities are limited
              will be involved in the  program.  ***
