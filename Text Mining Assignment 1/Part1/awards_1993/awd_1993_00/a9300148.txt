Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to provide opportunities for                  
              eligible undergraduate students in Science and Engineering to                  
              participate in a high quality state of the art research program in             
              the Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Washington University.              
              This three year program will provide opportunities for ten                     
              undergraduates to participate during a ten week summer period each             
              year.  The undergraduate students will conduct their research under            
              the supervision of three faculty members in the MRL.  The MRL is               
              currently organized primarily as a graduate program conducting                 
              research in a wide variety of areas with support from government,              
              industry, and the university.  The faculty of MRL is nationally and            
              internationally recognized for their particularly in the area of               
              composite materials.
