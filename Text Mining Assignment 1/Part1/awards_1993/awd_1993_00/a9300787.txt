              biodiversity project will survey and document the plants of the Amazonian state
              of Acre, Brazil.  Acre, on the border with Peru and Bolivia,  is being
              subjected to uncontrolled deforestation and  immigration from neighboring
              areas.  A million hectares in Acre have been survey geographical transects and
              establish permanent study sites, which will be monitored by local groups after
              the project is ended.  The survey will concentrate on gathering systematic,
              geographic, ecological, economic and ethnobotanical data.  Trees will be mapped
              to relocate populations for study of morphological variation, population
              structure and management of forest products.  Representative botanical
              collections will remain in local and national herbaria for scientific reference
              and study, and for student training.  One product of the survey will be a
              database signed to serve as a checklist of plants, a tool for mapping species
              distributions, a resource for medicinal plant use in the reserves, and a tool
              for studies of economic botany.  The database will be linked to other databases
              of Amazonian economic plants.  The project has strong in country collaboration
              with the Acre state agency (FUNTAC), which is interested in identification of
              the plants collected by the rubber tappers, and with ongoing ethnobotanical
              studies of the Kaxinawa Indians.  U.S. collaborators include the Smithsonian's
              Tropical Research Institute, which is involved in reconstructing past climates
              of the area.  %%% The Amazonian state of Acre, Brazil, on the border with Peru
              and Bolivia,  is being subjected to uncontrolled deforestation.  A million
              hectares in Acre have been set aside as extractive reserves to foster
              sustainable economic development and use of the forest products, such as rubber
              and Brazil nuts.  To that end, this four year biodiversity project will survey
              and document the plants of Acre for biotic research and economic development of
              sustainable resources.  The project has strong collaboration with Brazilian
              scientists and students, with special emphasis on the ethnobotanical knowledge
              of the Kaxinawa Indians. Also, the Smithsonian's Tropical Research Institute is
              involved in reconstructing past climates of the area.  The futu re of
              extractive reserves in Acre and their economic and sustainable use hinges on
              documenting its plants before the habitats are lost.       `     h     p     x
