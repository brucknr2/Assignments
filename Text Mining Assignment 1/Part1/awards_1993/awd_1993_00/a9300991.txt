Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hurricane Andrew crossed south Florida in late August of                       
              1992 producing considerable damage in the coastal ecosystem.                   
              In this study a group of researchers will assess damage to                     
              mangrove and seagrass habitats in the Shark River area and                     
              document the initial stages of recovery.
