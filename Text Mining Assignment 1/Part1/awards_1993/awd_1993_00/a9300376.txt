Abstract    :
                   This research: (1) treats variations in the "design concepts"             
              posed by other members of the design team as "conceptual noise";               
              (2) shows how to incorporate such noise into "conceptually robust"             
              decisions; (3) describes a method for using the same analysis to               
              provide preference information back to the other team members; and             
              (4) provides a procedure for determining whether to release the                
              conceptually robust design or to wait for further design certainty.            
              Taguchi's approach is used as a starting point because it is widely            
              known.  This project generalizes concurrent distributed decision               
              making procedure by employing genetic algorithms.                              
                   Concurrent engineering processes involve multi-functional                 
              teams, which make decisions about many parts of the                            
              product\production system and aspects of the product life-cycle                
              simultaneously.  This research argues that such concurrent                     
              distributed decisions must be based on communications about sets               
              of possibilities rather than single solutions.  By extending                   
              Taguchi's parameter design concepts, it develops a robust and                  
              distributed decision-making procedure based on such communications.            
              That is, it shows how a member of a design team can make                       
              appropriate decisions based on incomplete information from the                 
              other members of the team.
