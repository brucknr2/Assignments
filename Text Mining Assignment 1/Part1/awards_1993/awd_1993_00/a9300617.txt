Abstract    :
              9300617 Martin  This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.
              Joseph Shakal of the University of Wisconsin to conduct collaborative research
              with Dr. Shinichi Goto for 24 months at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory
              in Tsukuba, Japan.  They will apply Dr. Shakal's methods of auxiliary fuel
              injection to combustion experiments on a dual fuel diesel engine.  The Japanese
              Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is currently funding
              research on clean burning engine technology at the Mechanical Engineering
              Laboratory.  Dr. Goto is conducting experiments on reducing soot and nitrogen
              oxides and hydrocarbon emissions of diesel engines by injecting butane as a
              liquid near the intake valve at the time the valve is open.  Utilizing Dr.
              Shakal's expertise in dual fuel injectors, the team will install a dual fuel
              injector on the engine and conduct experiments with butane being injected after
              combustion of the diesel fuel is underway.  By measuring natural fluorescence
              and emissions, the team will determine the optimum injection conditions for a
              cleaner burning engine.  This clean burning technology could then be
              immediately applied to bus, truck, and other diesel engines in both the U.S.
              and Japan.
