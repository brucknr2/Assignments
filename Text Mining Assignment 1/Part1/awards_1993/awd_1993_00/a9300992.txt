                    9300992 Pereyra            This Phase II SBIR proposal aims to model,
              design algorithms, and produce software to analyze and interpret seismic data. 
              Enhanced global optimization techniques will be used to filter noisy data and
              to handle complex geophysical models that are not accessible to computation
              with the present methods.  This project builds upon the results of the work
              accomplished in Phase I on the construction of global optimization algorithms.
              %%% The resulting codes and software will find applications in seismic
              processing, reservoir delineation, and will help with enhanced recovery
              processes in the oil fields.  Applications are also envisioned to non
              destructive testing of mechanical components in industrial tools. ***
