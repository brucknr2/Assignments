Abstract    :
              9300978  Hereman  This project deals with the development and implementation of 
              new symbolic algorithms for the computation of Lie symmetries,  the
              investigation of integrability, and the calculation of  exact solutions of
              systems of nonlinear partial differential  equations (PDEs).    The first
              symbolic program will assist in computing classical  and nonclassical Lie-point
              symmetries, as well as generalized  symmetries, for large systems of
              differential equations.  The  second software package will automatically carry
              out the  Painleve integrability test for the existence of soliton  solutions. 
              Via a unified bilinear transformation method, it  will create 'solitons' for a
              large class of integrable PDEs.    The development of novel mathematical
              techniques, in addition  to the refinement and generalization of existing
              methods, is  an essential part of this research project.    The goal is to
              provide high quality symbolic programs, in  MACSYMA and MATHEMATICA, to
              researchers working on soliton  theory, dynamical systems, mathematical
              physics; specifically  wave phenomena in meteorology, bio-sciences, fluid
              dynamics,  plasma and particle physics, and nonlinear optics.  ***
