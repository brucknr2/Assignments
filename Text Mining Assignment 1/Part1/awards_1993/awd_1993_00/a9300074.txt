              Abstract for ATM-9300074       The stimulated emission pumping (SEP)technique
              has enabled the study of highly vibrationally excited molecules.  Such
              investigations are important because there is now considerable evidence for an
              efficient production mechanism for highly vibrationally excited oxygen
              molecules in the stratosphere and mesosphere.  Recent measurements have
              documented that ozone photolysis can produce excited O2 in states as high as
              v">26. It has been suggested that these excited oxygen molecules can
              significantly influence the ozone budget in the upper atmosphere.  For example,
              the stratospheric ozone concentration would be increased by 10% if only 10-4 of
              the total ozone photolysis leads to excited O2(v">26).  Thus, mechanisms
              involving vibrationally excited oxygen molecules may be the missing source of
              ozone that is required in order to explain the inability of the atmospheric
              models to reproduce the actual vertical profile of stratospheric ozone.     
              This research will investigate if the following mechanism provides an important
              source of stratospheric ozone:      (1)  O3 + hv (<238 nm)     >  O2(v">26) +
              O(3P)      (2)  O2(v">26) + O2        >   O3 + O      (3)  O + O2 + M          
               >   O3 + M      NET  O3 + O2               >    O3 + O The reaction rates for
              step 2 in the preceding mechanism will be determined during this study with the
              cavity ring down absorption spectroscopic method.  Temperature dependence
              measurements will also be performed.  In addition, a direct measurement of the
              vibrational distribution from ozone photodissociation at 226 nm will be
              attempted for comparison with recent results reported by other workers.  If
              these O2 photolysis products are  vibrationally excited, then this will
              establish the atmospheric source of highly vibrationally excited O2 and its
              role in the ozone budget of the upper atmosphere.
