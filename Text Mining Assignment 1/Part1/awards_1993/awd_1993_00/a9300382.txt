Abstract    :
              A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site is established            
              at the Fluid Dynamics Research Center (FDRC) of the Illinois                   
              Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago.  The program will be                 
              aimed at qualified undergraduate students enrolled at IIT as well              
              as at other universities and colleges in the state of Illinois.                
              It will be designed to provide the students selected with hands-               
              on experience in fluid mechanics research in an environment where              
              they will be exposed to new and exciting research problems and to              
              techniques that are at the 'cutting edge' of this field.  The FDRC             
              provides a strong disciplinary focus in Fluid Mechanics and                    
              Aerodynamics.  Research is supervised by six experienced faculty               
              members.  An REU participant would be a member of a research team,             
              interacting with the faculty as well as with other students.  They             
              will be given specific assignments tailored to obtain the right mix            
              of knowledge, the acquisition of new skills, and a sense of                    
              accomplishment and belonging.  The program includes site visits to             
              other R&D institutions and a round-table discussion with engineers             
              from these institutions who are involved in R&D.  It will provide              
              a rich learning experience and a good perspective on research                  
              opportunities in engineering.
