Abstract    :
              Gilbert  9300164    The studies by Dr. Gilbert on the mechanism by which a
              hormone  from the brain of the insect Manduca sexta acts upon specialized 
              glands (prothoracic glands) to cause these glands to begin  synthesizing a
              specific steroid hormone, an ecdysteroid.  Ecdysteroids are hormones that cause
              the insect to molt. i.e.  shed its exoskeleton, so that it can grow. They also
              elicit  metamorphosis, i.e. the means by which a caterpillar is  transformed
              into a pupa and then into an adult moth or butterfly.  The brain neurohormone
              is synthesized and released as a result of  environmental cues such as
              photoperiod and the synthesis and  release of Ecdysteroids by the prothoracic
              glands must be  extremely precise if the insect is to survive and be
              successful.  He is studying the means by which this peptide hormone interacts 
              with the glands, i.e. to stimulate the synthesis of a compound, a  second
              messenger, which in turn indirectly mediates the  phosphorylation (addition of
              a phosphate group) of specific  proteins that control ecdysteroidogenesis. By
              utilizing the  prothoracic glands which are composed of a single layer of 
              homogeneous cells, he should ultimately gain insights into the  mechanism of
              peptide hormone induced steroidogenesis that would  not be possible with the
              more heterogeneous adrenal gland.  ***
