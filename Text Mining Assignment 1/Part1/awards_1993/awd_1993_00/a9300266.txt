Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              California, Irvine in the purchase of an x-ray diffractometer                  
              with a rotating anode x-ray source, associated data collection                 
              and analysis system and an upgrade of an older x-ray                           
              diffractometer.  This new instrumentation will enhance greatly                 
              research in a number of areas including the following:                         
                                                                                             
              1)  Synthesis and study of ligand-bridged transition metal                     
              compounds,                                                                     
              2)  The chemistry of low-valent organosamarium (II) complexes,                 
              3)  Synthesis and chemistry of httrium and lanthanide metal                    
              complexes,                                                                     
              4)  Silsesquioxanes as models for aluminosilicates,                            
              5)  Chemistry of organosulfur compounds,                                       
              6)  Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of quaternary carbon centers,               
              7)  Synthesis of complex polycyclics by palladium catalyzed                    
              polyene cyclizations,                                                          
              8)  Structural studies of bridgehead alkenes,                                  
              9)  Molecular deformations and chemical reactivity.                            
                                                                                             
              The rotating anode capability will permit structural studies                   
              which are not possible with stationary source radiation.                       
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The x-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise                  
              measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a                      
              molecule.  The information obtained gives the precise values of                
              all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and                 
              it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of                 
              the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
