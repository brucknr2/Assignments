Abstract    :
              9300657  Grunbaum  The research involves investigations in the fundamental
              geometry  of convex polytopes, configuations and combinatorial aspects of 
              symmetries.  Applications are proposed to tiling patterns is a  variety of
              contexts including architectural design and  stereoscopic viewing.  Another
              component of the proposal entails  an undergradaute education activity in
              aspects of geometrical  structure.  The investigator also proposes further
              development of  instructional material in several areas of geometry suitable
              for  students at the high school and junior college level.  Activities  in
              participation with teachers at these levels is also envisaged.
