Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the properties of superfluid He-3 and spin-             
              polarized He-3/He-4 mixtures.  He-3 serves as model complex                    
              superfluid.  Experiments on this system relate to other highly                 
              correlated systems, including high-Tc superconductors.  The                    
              collective modes in the superfluids will be investigated by                    
              acoustical methods, including second-sound.  Additional experiments            
              will use nuclear magnetic resonance as a characterization probe.               
              The experiments on dilute spin polarized He-3/He-4 mixtures will               
              focus on relaxation process in the fluids which arise via domain               
              wall or soliton motion in the fluids.  A goal of the research is to            
              determine the relative importance of direct radiation of                       
              radiofrequency, as compared with radiation of spin waves, as a                 
              domain wall moves in a magnetic field.

              This project investigates the fundamental properties of fluids at              
              very low temperatures.  These "superfluids" exhibit behavior                   
              related to high-temperature superconductors, whose properties                  
              remain unexplained.  The superfluids also provide model system for             
              studying fundamental thermodynamics of fluid mixtures.  Again, the             
              results are relevant to systems at higher temperatures and in                  
              practical conditions.  Finally, the author has a facility that                 
              provides a way to apply a very large magnetic field to the samples             
              and hence carry out unique experiments to study magnetic domain                
              wall motion, and other dynamical behavior exhibited by magnetic                
              materials.
