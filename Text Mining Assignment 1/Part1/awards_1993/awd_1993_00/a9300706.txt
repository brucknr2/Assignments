Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The goal of this project is to develop a new ocean circulation                 
              model including free-surface effects.  The model will be used to               
              understand the dynamical nature of the oceanic general circulation,            
              with focus on the multiple solutions of the thermohaline                       
              circulation.  One of the study's practical applications is the                 
              prediction and interpolation of sea level changes occurring during             
              a global warming scenario, including effects of heat expansion and             
              ice melting.  Some other goals of this project are the study of the            
              energetics of the oceanic general circulation, including the                   
              mechanical energy source due to freshwater flux forcing, the                   
              mechanical energy balance in the quasi-steady circulation, and the             
              circulation seasonal cycle.
