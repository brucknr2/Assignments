Abstract    :
              In this research project, supported by the Analytical and                      
              Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Grassian will study the                   
              photodissociation and photodesorption of adsorbates from oxide                 
              supported metal particles, using both tunable pulsed laser and                 
              broadband light sources.  Infrared and mass spectrometry will                  
              be used to monitor the reactions of methyl halides and CO                      
              adsorbed on Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 surfaces.  The results of this                
              research will help researchers to understand the dynamics of                   
              surface photochemistry. Measurements on high surface area                      
              supported particles will be compared with results obtained for                 
              similar systems on single crystal metal surfaces in ultra high                 
              vacuum.

              The interaction of light with catalytic systems may be an                      
              important route to the catalytic synthesis of novel molecular                  
              species.  In order to investigate the possibility and promise                  
              of photocatalysis, a detailed understanding of photoinitiated                  
              chemistry on highly dispersed oxide supported metal particles                  
              must be obtained.  This research project addresses the                         
              fundamental questions underlying photocatalytic processes.
