Abstract    :
                   Undergraduate participation in research concentrated on remote            
              sensing applications to the understanding of geologic processes on             
              the Earth and terrestrial planets will allow students in the mid-              
              Atlantic region of the U.s. to take advantage of the research                  
              efforts underway at the National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian             
              Institution.  Within the Museum's Center for Earth and Planetary               
              Studies, researchers are using data obtained from a variety of                 
              Earth-looking and planetary spacecraft to study aeolian processes              
              and real-time changes in desert environments as they relate to the             
              geologic record of climate change, the roughness of volcanic                   
              surfaces measured via radar to determine physical parameters that              
              are used to constrain hypotheses for the origin of similar surfaces            
              on Venus, and structural landforms in intraplate regions on Earth              
              as analogs to extraterrestrial structures.  A two-year program of              
              undergraduate participation is proposed to allow a close                       
              association between the student and mentor, and to broaden                     
              students' interests in, and knowledge of earth science processes.
