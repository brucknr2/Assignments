Abstract    :
              9300633  GOPAL       A form of non-programmed adaptive information processing 
              called Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) provides an alternative  means for
              performing complicated and creative tasks like pattern  classification and
              completion as well as image and speech  recognition.  ANNs are inherently
              parallel in structure, they  distribute knowledge throughout the system rather
              than  concentrating it in specific locations, and they are fault-  tolerant,
              learning from and making decisions based on incomplete,  noisy, or imprecise
              information.  Because of these  characteristics, ANNs offer great potential for
              future use in  processing of geographic information, but that potential has not
               been widely explored by geographers and regional scientists.  Working with an
              Austrian collaborator, an American geographer  will explore a number of
              potential uses for ANNs in geographic  research.  Attention in this project
              will focus on applications  to the study of spatial interaction. 
              Application-dependent  neural spatial interaction predictors will be designed, 
              implemented, and tested, as will unsupervised ANN-based  interaction pattern
              detectors.  ANN approaches to these problems  will be compared with traditional
              statistical approaches through  empirical testing with data on Austrian
              inter-regional telephone  calls.       This project constitutes an exploratory
              look into the  potential for using ANN approaches in the analysis of 
              geographical patterns and processes.  By focusing on spatial  interaction, the
              investigators will explore new analytical  perspectives on an important topic
              for which conventional  approaches are well established.  Regardless of the
              outcomes of  these comparisons, scientists in geography, regional science, 
              computer science, and related fields will benefit from this  research on an
              innovative new approach to problem solving.  ***
