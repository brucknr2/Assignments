Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of urban agriculture             
              in Kampala, Uganda, examining this form of farming as an adaptive              
              response to the economic crisis which besets much of Africa.  With             
              a diverse set of research methodologies, this project will collect             
              and analyze dietary and nutritional anthropometry data, land access            
              and tenure data as well as socio-economic and agricultural data.               
              Theoretical analysis will focus on the reasons for urban                       
              agriculture, the constraints on this practice, and the impacts on              
              individual well-being and on the household.                                    
                                                                                             
                   This study promises to collect information of significant                 
              value for African urban policy, and it will contribute to the                  
              sociological understanding of human adaptations to social and                  
              economic crisis.  In addition to the scientific gains to be                    
              achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a                  
              highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.                  
              dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific                    
              manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next                   
              generation of sociologists.
