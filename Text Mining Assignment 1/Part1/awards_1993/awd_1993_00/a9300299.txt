Abstract    :
              Occidental College Biology Department proposes to develop an                   
              REU site that will bring together a diverse group of                           
              undergraduates to do summer research in cell and molecular                     
              biology.  The research will be supervised by the three                         
              faculty members involved in the Cellular and Molecular                         
              Emphasis, whose research areas are:  molecular biology of                      
              aging, molecular immunology, and neurobiology.  These                          
              faculty members are strongly committed to encouraging women                    
              and students of color to consider science as a career.  The                    
              students will be recruited from Occidental itself, a highly                    
              selective liberal arts college with 40% minority enrollment,                   
              and from other colleges.  Particular recruiting efforts will                   
              be focused upon the surrounding community colleges with                        
              which we already have ties.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The program will allow each student to become familiar with                    
              the literature, perform a project, interact with the other                     
              students and the faculty in the program extensively, prepare                   
              and present a poster on their project, and interact with                       
              several off campus speakers, including alumnae/i who are                       
              presently graduate students at CalTech, USC, and UCLA.
