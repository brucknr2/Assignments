Abstract    :
                   The focus of this research is on the representations of Lie               
              algebras, Lie groups, and quantum groups, and their                            
              combinatorics.  The principal investigator will work on (1)                    
              centralizer algebras of tensor representations; (2) Weyl group                 
              symmetric functions; (3) branching rules and centralizer                       
              algebras;  and (4) weight and root multiplicities for Kac-Moody                
              Lie algebras.                                                                  
                   This research is concerned with a mathematical object called              
              a Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another object called a                
              Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a                    
              sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie groups and              
              Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of                      
              spherical motion.
