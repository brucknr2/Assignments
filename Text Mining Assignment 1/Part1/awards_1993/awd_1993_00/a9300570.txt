Abstract    :
                   This REU site award supports six undergraduate researchers                
              working under the supervision of two faculty advisors.  The                    
              program will run for eight weeks.  Students will divide their                  
              time between experimental calculations and mathematical analysis.              
              Depending on their interests, students will be assigned to one of              
              two groups.  One group will work on a project in algebraic                     
              geometry and computer algebra.  A useful tool in this effort is                
              the Macaulay software which is available and not difficult to                  
              learn. The other project will be in analysis and representation                
              theory.  Students will be required to produce written reports at               
              the end of the program and summarize their work in oral                        
              presentations to the other students and Mathematics Department.
