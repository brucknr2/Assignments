Abstract    :
                   This project will bring eight undergraduates to the National              
              Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of             
              Illinois for a full semester of research. Recruiting is to be                  
              national in scope. The selected students will be matched with an               
              NCSA research project in accordance with their interests and                   
              background. The disciplinary focus of the project will be                      
              computational science, with particular emphasis in the application             
              of parallelization and visualization concepts and techniques.
