Abstract    :
                   A number of inference problems in nonparametric function  estimation will
              be investigated during the course of this  project. The problems to be
              considered include i) estimation of  breakpoints for regression functions or
              their derivatives, ii)  development of practical confidence bands for use in 
              nonparametric regression, iii) construction of diagnostic  goodness-of-fit
              tests using nonparametric function estimation  methodology in a variety of
              settings, including censored data and  additive models, and iv) spline
              smoothing with correlated errors.       It is often reasonable to believe in
              many areas of science,  such as biology, engineering, psychology, etc., that
              the data  being collected is produced by two components: a nonrandom 
              component, representing a characteristic of nature  common to all  individuals
              or subjects, and a random component that accounts for  individual variation.
              This nonrandom component represents the  understandable or predictable aspect
              of the phenomenon being  studied and is therefore of considerable interest.
              Nonparametric  function estimation is an area of statistics concerned with the 
              development of flexible methods for estimating or describing the  nonrandom
              components of data.  The current research project deals  with a variety of
              problems in nonparametric function estimation  including i) the development of
              procedures for estimating a point  where an abrupt change has occurred in some
              phenomenon (e.g.,  locating a point of sudden change in the discharge of water
              from  a river or prices of a commodity) ii) the construction of  accuracy
              measures (similar to those associated with popularity  polls, etc.) to
              accompany nonparametric function estimators and  iii) the development of
              statistical methods to assess the  accuracy of models that have been postulated
              by scientists to  describe various processes they are studying.
