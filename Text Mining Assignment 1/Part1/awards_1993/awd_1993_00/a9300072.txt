Abstract    :
              The proposed project has as its first objective the completion of              
              the analysis of seminal experiments on the diffusion of muonic                 
              hydrogen atoms (up and ud) in H2 and D2 gas, and the use of these              
              results to design and undertake an experiment to measure the rate              
              of the reaction up>nv in the triplet state of the up atom. The                 
              purpose of this experiment is to measure the pseudoscalar                      
              coupling constant in muon capture to 10% accuracy by a method                  
              independent of radiative muon capture experiments.  Techniques                 
              involving scintillation counters and neutron sensitive liquid                  
              methane-filled proportional chambers will be used.  The second                 
              purpose of the project, to be carried out simultaneously with the              
              muon capture studies described above, is to establish the                      
              existence of 2S state metastability in muonic boron, and to begin              
              the measurement of parity non-conserving (PNC) effects in muonic               
              boron.  The PNC experiment will make use of the directional                    
              correlation between the decay electron of the muon and the M1                  
              photon emitted from the metastable muonic boron atoms. Techniques              
              involving scintillation and solid-state detectors will be used.
