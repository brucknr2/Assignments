              causes of extinction following rain forest fragmentation.  In Thailand, a
              hydroelectric reservoir filled in 1987 and left 162 rain forest fragments as
              islands in Chiew Larn reservoir.  Since 1990 we have monitored the effects of
              this habitat fragmentation on the population viability of 12 species of small
              ground dwelling mammals in these now isolated  habitat patches.  We find that
              habitat fragmentation leads to rapid local extinction and are investigating the
              factors causing extirpation of some species.  This entails studies of genetic
              variability and of inter specific interactions  between the mammals themselves
              and their food resources (plants and insects).  This is the first study to
              examine both ecological and genetic effects of rain forest fragmentation on
              mammals in the first decade following habitat alteration. %%% The small mammals
              we are monitoring serve as models of larger mammals that are usually the focus
              of wildlife conservation efforts and as general indicators of forest ecosystem
              functioning.  The project has great generality throughout the humid tropics
              where forests are  being fragmented by development projects and exploitation. 
              The policy implications of our research are that fragmented forests require
              intensive management if they are to provide ecological services and biological
              resources for future generations.   #    d   \        P    C        P#      #
