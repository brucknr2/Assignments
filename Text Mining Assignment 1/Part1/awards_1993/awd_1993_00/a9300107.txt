Abstract    :
              Dr. John P. Fackler of the Chemistry Department, Texas A&M                     
              University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                   
              Organometallic Program for investigation of the chemistry of                   
              dinuclear and polynuclear complexes of Group 11 elements,                      
              particularly copper and gold.  Fackler will model metal-metal                  
              bond formation and rupture, as related to bimetallic oxidative                 
              addition reactions.  The emphasis is on the influence of                       
              neighboring metals and coordinated ligands in gold complexes,                  
              but the results will have relevance to catalytic reactions of                  
              other d-10 metals, such as copper(I), silver(I), nickel,                       
              platinum and palladium.  The luminescence properties of these                  
              compounds will be exploited for characterization.  Mixed metal                 
              cluster systems involving copper(I) and silver(I) will also be                 
              studied, along with species containing platinum and gold chains.               
              %%%                                                                            
              In this basic research project, Dr. John Fackler of Texas A&M                  
              University will synthesize new compounds which contain two or                  
              more metal atoms.  Gold will be used in most of these                          
              compounds, in combination with copper or silver.  One compound,                
              for example, that will be prepared will contain a chain of six                 
              gold and platinum atoms.  The purpose of the study is to                       
              investigate the reactivity of the compounds in reactions in                    
              which small molecules, such as carbon monoxide and sulfur                      
              dioxide, are inserted into or across the metal-metal bond.                     
              These reactions serve as models for many types of catalytic                    
              reactions involving gold, platinum, palladium, silver, and                     
              nickel.
