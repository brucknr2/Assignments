Abstract    :
                   This project will bring ten undergraduates to Hunter College              
              of CUNY in the summer of 1993 for a four week period, to be                    
              followed up with a once weekly academic year experience to continue            
              the work.  All students will be from groups underrepresented in                
              computer science and engineering research.  Research topics will               
              focus on finite algebra and finite geometry, specifically finite               
              projective affine and subaffine planes and the existence and                   
              properties of functions which are either Sheffer or Sheffer with               
              constants.  Additionally, speakers will be brought in to discuss               
              social and ethical issues involving legal intellectual property,               
              large distribute systems, and large hardware and software systems.
