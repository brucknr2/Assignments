Abstract    :
                   This project is a continuation of an REU site, which involves             
              approximately ten undergraduate students per year in a summer                  
              internship program.  The fields of study are all thrust areas                  
              within the Department of Physics at UAH, and include space plasma              
              physics, optics, and materials science.  These related topics are              
              presented under the unified theme of "Space Physics and                        
              Instrumentation".  Students will be involved in the study of                   
              materials used in the construction of, and optical characteristics             
              of, space instrumentation, as well as in the scientific return from            
              spacecraft and ground-based instruments studying the Earth, the                
              Sun, and astronomical objects.  The students, and their advising               
              faculty, will meet weekly as a group to discuss progress.  The                 
              proposed topics constitute genuine research endeavors, yet, as our             
              experience shows, can realistically be completed in one summer.                
                   Recruitment is primarily targeted as students outside the                 
              local area, but within the Southeast region.  Women and minorities             
              will be especially targeted; indeed over 70% of the students funded            
              the previous award were women.  The research environment is                    
              outstanding, and students will have many opportunities to interact             
              with scientists and facilities both in local industry and at the               
              nearby NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.
