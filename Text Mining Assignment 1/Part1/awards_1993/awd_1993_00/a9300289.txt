Abstract    :
                   This project establishes a statewide network of 33                        
              institutions, and connects 29 of the institutions to the net.  The             
              other four institutions already have connections to the mid-level              
              network  MIDNET.  Faculty and students at the institutions will                
              benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including                
              libraries and supercomputers.  In addition, they will be able to               
              communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other campuses in               
              pursuit of research and educational projects.
