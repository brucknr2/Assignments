Abstract    :
              This award provides support to The Savannah River Ecology                      
              Laboratory's (SREL) to continue their Research Experiences                     
              for Undergraduates SITE for another two years.  The program                    
              will provide research experience, training, and career                         
              perspective for undergraduate students through the use of                      
              the unique field sites, laboratory facilities, and through                     
              the association and active involvement in research with full-                  
              time research ecologists. Project participants will examine                    
              the influence of by-products of nuclear and fossil fuel                        
              energy production on selected biological and chemical                          
              properties in southeastern ecosystems. SREL faculty members,                   
              all actively engaged in research and publication, will be                      
              paired with students having compatible research interests.                     
              Student projects, while distinct and independent, are                          
              portions of ongoing research programs at SREL. The student                     
              experience is enhanced by interaction with a programmatic                      
              team comprising individuals with a diversity of ecological                     
              backgrounds, interests, and ideas. Applicants from minority                    
              schools and regional institutions with limited research                        
              programs will continue to be actively encouraged, as in                        
              previous years. Participant selection is based upon the                        
              quality of an application, letters of recommendation and                       
              academic record.  Through the research training of more than                   
              450 undergraduate participants over the past 24 years, SREL                    
              has created a highly successful program of student/advisor                     
              interaction. Scientific publications and career development                    
              of former participants attest to the success of the program.
