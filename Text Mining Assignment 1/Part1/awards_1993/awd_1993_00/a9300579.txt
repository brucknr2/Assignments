Abstract    :
              There will be a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)                  
              program in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at Cornell.  Every                
              effort is to be made to include women and underrepresented                     
              minorities at a proportion that reflects their numbers in society.             
              Under-represented minorities will be energetically recruited                   
              through the NSF-funded Engineering Synthesis Coalition.  The summer            
              program will start with a two-week training period, in which the               
              students will learn basic machine shop skills, some computer                   
              skills, and basic electronic circuit construction skills.  The                 
              students will then work with their individual advisor, meeting at              
              least weekly.  The summer program will also include weekly REU                 
              meetings, tours of Cornell labs and of local companies, and some               
              social activities.  Every student will write a final report and all            
              students will give a short final oral presentation.  Participation             
              in the REU program is likely to increase the chance that students              
              will pursue graduate studies.
