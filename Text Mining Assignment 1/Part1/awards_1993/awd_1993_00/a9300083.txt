Abstract    :
              9300083  Strauss                                            The goal of this
              research is to test the usefulness of mitochondrial DNA as a marker of
              population differentiation in plants.  Preliminary studies of mitochondrial DNA
              variation in pines have indicated that very strong differentiation can exist in
              the presence of weak nuclear gene (allozyme) differentiation.  This observation
              will be rigorously examined via nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-RFLP analysis
              using cloned and PCR-derived hybridization probes, respectively.  A marker that
              is highly sensitive to population differences could aid conservation biologists
              when choosing among populations for inclusion in a conservation program--as
              well as have many other uses in plant population biology and breeding.  %%% 
              The study will employ the California Closed-Cone Pines (Pinus attenuata, P.
              muricata, and P. radiata) as a model system.  This group has been the subject
              of extensive population genetic and systematic studies over several
              decades--most recently for allozyme, chloroplast DNA, and coxI mitochondrial
              DNA polymorphism.  %%%  If time permits, work will begin to develop methods
              that rely exclusively on PCR for studying mitochondrial DNA polymorphism.  Such
              a method would be as easy to conduct as isozyme studies, and thus increase the
              extent to which operational conservation programs could use mitochondrial DNA
              studies in identifying populations for protection or sampling.      uct as
