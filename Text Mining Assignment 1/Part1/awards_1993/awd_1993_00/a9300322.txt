Abstract    :
                   The profound significance regarding the disciplines of                    
              hydrology and hydrogeology, as well as the associated need for well            
              trained professionals, is quite evident.  This significance is                 
              accentuated in drought prone areas like the semi-arid western                  
              portion of the United States.  The Hydrology/Hydrogeology (H/H)                
              Program at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) is nationally                  
              recognized for excellence, with 24 faculty members and over 70                 
              graduate students.  The UNR summer program was extremely                       
              successful, especially since this was our first effort.                        
                   We are requesting funding to continue the UNR summer REU                  
              program in hydrology and hydrogeology.  We have attempted to build             
              upon our past successes while addressing the few noted                         
              shortcomings.  Our faculty are quite excited about the prospects               
              of once again working with a group of exceptional undergraduate                
              students.
