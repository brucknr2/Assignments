Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase II project deals with improved MPEG-based video                
              compression techniques and their implementation for very                       
              high-resolution video applications found in the emerging electronic            
              cinema industry.  The electronic cinema is a motion picture theater            
              in which conventional film projection is replaced by a                         
              high-resolution video system.  The system employs highly compressed            
              video transmitted by satellite to the theater, which contains a                
              digital video recorder, real-time decompression hardware, and an               
              advanced light-valve projector.  The principal investigator is                 
              developing a complete set of improved compression algorithms and               
              implementing them in a mixed hardware-software laboratory                      
              prototype.
