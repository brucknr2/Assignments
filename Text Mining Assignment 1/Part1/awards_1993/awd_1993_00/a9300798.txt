              year project will document the diversity, systematics and geographic
              distribution of the Agaricales (mushrooms and related fungi) of Costa Rican oak
              forests.  These fungi play a vital role in nutrient cycling, nutrient uptake
              and decomposition of organic matter in the oak forests of montane Mexico,
              Central America and Colombia.  Costa Rica is an ideal site to obtain some of
              the essential data on composition, species distribution and host specificity of
              these fungi in the neotropics; the data can then be applied to other Central
              and South American oak forests.  The project will produce an illustrated manual
              of these fungi and, importantly, a comprehensive computerized database of
              morphological, ecological, and distributional data.  In country collaboration
              includes scientists at INBio, the University of Costa Rica, the Organization of
              Tropical Studies at La Selva and a Costa Rican graduate student.  Mycological
              collections will be deposited in Costa Rica for research and training of
              students.  No similar comprehensive study of fungi has been undertaken in
              tropical America. %%% The Agaricales    mushrooms and related fungi    play a
              vital ecological role in the oak forests of montane Mexico, Central America and
              Colombia, but no comprehensive study of these fungi has been undertaken in
              tropical America.. This project will document the diversity of these fungi in
              Costa Rican oak forests, which are ideal sites to obtain some of the essential
              data that can then be applied to conservation and sustainable use efforts in
              other Central and South American oak forests.  The project will produce an
              illustrated manual of these fungi and, importantly, a comprehensive
              computerized database of morphological, ecological, and distributional data. 
              In country collaboration includes scientists at INBio, the Unive rsity of Costa
              Rica, and the Organization of Tropical Studies at La Selva. The voucher
              collections of fungi will be deposited in Costa Rica for research projects and
              for training of students.  ***
