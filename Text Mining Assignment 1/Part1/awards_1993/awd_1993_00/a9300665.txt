Abstract    :
              9300665  Brennen    A combined experimental and analytical study of the effect
              of  vibrations on the motion of a granular material is proposed.   The study
              aims to improve fundamental understanding of basic  mechanisms in relatively
              simple situations.  The "phase change"  caused by vibrations, bifurcation,
              transition to chaotic  behavior, velocity and granular temperature profiles
              will be  measured with instrumentation developed by the research group.  
              Numerical simulations of one-dimensional columns of particles on  a vibrating
              plate, and of flow in externally vibrated chutes  will be performed, and
              compared to experiments.    It is expected that fundamental data on vibrating
              granular  materials will be obtained, with application to  vibrofluidization,
              molding of powder materials and others  industrial processes.  The work has
              relevance also to earthquake  and geotechnical engineering.  ***
