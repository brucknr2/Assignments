Abstract    :
              Research in membrane and thin film science has been identified as              
              a critical need in a recent NSF Workshop report and in three recent            
              NRC reports.  Eleven faculty in the Department of Chemical                     
              Engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder will                      
              participate in this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)              
              program.  Recruiting for the REU will be done in cooperation with              
              the Minority Engineering, Women in Engineering, and Summer Minority            
              Access to Research Training programs.  The REU program will involve            
              training in research methods, safety, information retrieval,                   
              professional ethics, problem-solving skills, oral and written                  
              communication skills, analytical techniques, and preparing for                 
              graduate school.  A significant institutional commitment is made               
              in terms of funds contributed to REU stipend support, travel,                  
              housing, laboratory supplies, and student benefits.
