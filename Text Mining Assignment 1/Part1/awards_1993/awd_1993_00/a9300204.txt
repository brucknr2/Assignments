Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to The Center for Biology at the                     
              University of Wisconsin - Madison to support a summer                          
              program which provides research opportunities to talented                      
              minority undergraduates in cellular and molecular biology.                     
              Ten students will be recruited nationwide in order to                          
              encourage and prepare them for graduate studies.. UW-Madison                   
              will sponsor 4 additional students, bringing the total                         
              involvement to 14.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Building on expertise gained from three previous summer                        
              programs for minority undergraduates, prospective faculty                      
              mentors and program staff will provide an environment                          
              designed to foster critical thinking, creative problem                         
              solving, and productive research skills. Twenty-four                           
              committed faculty (18 having mentored in previous summers)                     
              will lead in the design, planning, implementation and                          
              evaluation of the summer program. The core of the program                      
              lies in individual, independent research experiences under                     
              the mentorship of faculty members with shared research                         
              interests in cellular and molecular biology. Research                          
              experiences will be augmented by a seminar/workshop series                     
              to promote growth as independent researchers and prepare                       
              students for graduate study. The capstone experience will be                   
              a symposium in which students formally present research                        
              results to colleagues and faculty. The program will                            
              integrate multicultural and social activities, which are                       
              vital for providing the students with a productive,                            
              enjoyable and satisfying summer research experience.
