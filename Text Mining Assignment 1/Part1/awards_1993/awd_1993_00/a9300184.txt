Abstract    :
                   This action will continue support for an REU Site at the                  
              University of Nevada-Las Vegas.  The attendees will be                         
              involved in research efforts in the areas of atomic,                           
              molecular, and optical physics, astronomy, and condensed                       
              matter physics.  Students will have the opportunity to obtain                  
              hands-on laboratory experience using lasers, to analyze                        
              astronomical data on a workstation using image analysis                        
              software, and to perform numerical computation and simulation                  
              using the UNLV Cray supercomputer.  Students will be recruited                 
              from UNLV undergraduates and from schools in the western part                  
              of the United States.
