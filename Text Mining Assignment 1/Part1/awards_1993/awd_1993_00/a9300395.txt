Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for six students to                  
              work under faculty supervision on mathematical problems related                
              to the theory of matrices.  The project will run for eight weeks,              
              with several faculty participating either in an official capacity              
              or as interested volunteers.  The theme of matrix theory and                   
              itsapplications is not only readily accessible to undergraduates               
              but will also allow them to attack a progressive series of                     
              problems of increasing difficulty and generality.  Several of the              
              projects will benefit from exploration using sophisticated                     
              mathematical software packages for symbolic and matrix                         
              calculations.  A written final report together with interim oral               
              reports will be required.  Visits to facilities where actual                   
              mathematical applications are carried out, such as the                         
              NASA/Langley Research Center, INCASE, the Virginia Institute of                
              Marine Science and the Continuous Electronic Beam Accelerator                  
              Facility are scheduled.
