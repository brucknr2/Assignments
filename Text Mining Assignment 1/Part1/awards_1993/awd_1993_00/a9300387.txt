Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Biology department of                         
              Temple University to support as an REU site for a combined                     
              academic year and summer program of undergraduate research.                    
              This program will draw on the department's extensive                           
              experience with undergraduate research as part of the                          
              academic year research program, and also incorporate                           
              elements of the Temple University Basic Science Summer                         
              Minority Program which has been in effect for the past two                     
              years.  The goal of this program is to provide a rich                          
              research environment and a sense of community among                            
              promising students in order to encourage them to enter                         
              careers in the biological sciences.                                            
                                                                                             
              To achieve this goal, the program will have two major                          
              components.  The first of these is continued academic year                     
              participation in research projects by students enrolled at                     
              Temple.  The second is an intensive Summer research program                    
              which will reach out to students beyond Temple.  Academic                      
              year students will have the opportunity to participate in                      
              the Summer program.  In both components, special effort will                   
              be made to attract underrepresented minority students.
