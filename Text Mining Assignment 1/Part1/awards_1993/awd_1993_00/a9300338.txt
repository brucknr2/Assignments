Abstract    :
              The Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at             
              Boston University has a particularly strong research program in the            
              rapidly changing field of signal processing and signal recognition.            
              Faculty from different academic and professional backgrounds                   
              combine their unique skills to form a research area that has a                 
              unified, cohesive theme.  Under the Research Experiences for                   
              Undergraduates Site program, students will become involved in a                
              variety of projects related to signal processing and recognition.              
              The projects include:  the study of hesitation and disfluency in               
              spontaneous human speech as related to automated speech                        
              understanding; a technique called "knowledge-based signal                      
              processing"; and a project related to ionospheric plasma heating               
              experiments.
