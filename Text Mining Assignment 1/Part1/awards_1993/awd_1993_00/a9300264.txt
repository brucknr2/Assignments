Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              All species of sea turtle are either endangered or threatened.                 
              Those concerned with the conservation of sea turtles are strongly              
              interested in the behavior of these animals.  Drs. Mellgren and                
              Mann will conduct exploratory research on the behavioral                       
              capacities of hatchling green and hawksbill sea turtles that are               
              being "head-started" in a conservation project in Quintana Roo,                
              Mexico.  Experiments on diet selection, learning, and species and              
              kin recognition will be carried out at the turtles' natal beach.               
              The research will be done in cooperation with Mexican biologists               
              involved in the conservation project.                                          
                                                                                             
              Information gained in this research will be important for                      
              understanding reptilian function in general and marine turtles in              
              particular.  Efforts to conserve sea turtles will benefit from a               
              better understanding of the basic processes governing their                    
              behavior.
