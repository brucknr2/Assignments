Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to establish a Research                              
              Experiences for Undergraduates SITE at Mountain Lake                           
              Biological Station, a facility of  the University of                           
              Virginia located in the Allegheny Mountains of southwestern                    
              Virginia.  This Field Station attracts researchers from                        
              throughout the country who come to the station to study the                    
              population biology of local plants and animals. Students                       
              will be chosen from a national pool of applicants to spend                     
              ten weeks at the station during the summer. The students                       
              will meet together with an REU coordinator at least once a                     
              week to discuss general issues on the conduct of science and                   
              their specific projects. Students will work closely with                       
              mentors to design and complete independent research projects                   
              in areas that could include the epidemiology of plant                          
              parasite-host systems, the ecological genetics of plant                        
              pollination systems, the genetic implications of group                         
              living in insects, the behavioral ecology of birds, the                        
              analysis of local vegetation patterns, and the interactions                    
              between                                                                        
              populations that live in adjacent communities.
