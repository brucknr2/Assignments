Abstract    :
              9300063  Ervin-Tripp    The purpose of this dissertation project is to examine
              the acquisition and development of language which reflects pragmatic and social
              knowledge in young Japanese children.  A detailed analysis of the early
              language usage of preschool children in different contexts will provide insight
              into their increasingly sophisticated sociolinguistic awareness.  This work
              will fill a long-standing void within the field of language acquisition, as
              cross-linguistic research on this topic has just begun to appear in the
              literature.  The student will study Japanese children's knowledge of the
              sociolinguistic rules that underlie appropriate language use by examining the
              repertoire of registers that young children possess, the specific linguistic
              devices they use to mark distinct registers and the development of these
              registers.    The objectives of this research are (1) to gain insight into the
              social and pragmatic understanding of young children, (2) to attain a clearer
              understanding of the processes by which children become socialized through
              language, (3) to compile a detailed description of how Japanese children
              acquire pragmatic competence, and (4) to illustrate how pragmatic factors play
              a crucial role in the selection of syntactic and lexical forms even in
              preschool children.  Japanese is ideal for studying language use which reflects
              social and pragmatic knowledge, as this type of information is clearly
              grammaticized and lexicalized in the language.  Data will be collected through
              role-play situations, naturalistic observations in the home and at school as
              well as in interviews with children, their mothe rs and their teachers.
