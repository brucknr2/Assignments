Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Biology Department of                         
              Furman University to continue a successful Research                            
              Experiences for Undergraduates Site.                                           
                                                                                             
              The program will provide a stimulating biological research                     
              experience for 12 students this coming summer.  Talented                       
              students will be recruited from Furman University and                          
              smaller, less research-oriented colleges in South Carolina.                    
              The program is especially aimed at women, minority students,                   
              and persons with disabilities, and such individuals will                       
              make up the majority of the participants.  Half the students                   
              will be rising seniors and half will be rising sophomores.                     
              Six research groups will be formed, each consisting of a                       
              senior, a sophomore, and a faculty research director.                          
              Students many choose to work on research projects in areas                     
              ranging from ecology to molecular biology.  The goal of this                   
              program is to support productive, publishable research                         
              involving undergraduates, with a special focus on promising                    
              younger students.  The program builds on a strong tradition                    
              of undergraduate research in a liberal arts environment at                     
              Furman, and a successful NSF-REU program over the past two                     
              summers.
