Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of world primary                 
              commodity markets, seeking to develop a comprehensive framework for            
              analysis of their operation based on examination of the evolution              
              of the world coffee market.  Data will be used to evaluate and                 
              integrate three alternative modes of analysis: bargaining power                
              theory, commodity agreement theory, and political negotiation                  
              theory.                                                                        
                                                                                             
                   The research will not only contribute to historical sociology             
              and economic sociology, but it will augment the knowledge base for             
              understanding relations between advanced industrial nations and the            
              Third World nations which are dependent upon commodity exports.  In            
              addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,               
              this award will materially assist a highly promising student in                
              completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it                       
              contributes to future scientific manpower and the thorough training            
              of the next generation of sociologists.
