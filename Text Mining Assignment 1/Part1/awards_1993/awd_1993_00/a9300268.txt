Abstract    :
              Dr. Darrell J. Woodman and other members of the Chemistry                      
              Department of University of Washington are being supported to                  
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in               
              Chemistry.  For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students will             
              spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of                   
              research projects.  Projects cover all areas of chemistry-                     
              analytical, inorganic, organic, organometallic, bioorganic,                    
              biophysical, environmental, nuclear and chemical physics.  A unique            
              feature of this program is that at least half of the participants              
              will be chosen from smaller schools in the region to work under the            
              joint supervision of department faculty together with faculty                  
              mentors from their home institution. In addition special emphasis              
              will be given women, minorities and the physically disabled.
