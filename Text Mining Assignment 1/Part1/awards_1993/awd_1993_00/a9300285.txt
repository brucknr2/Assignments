Abstract    :
                   This action will establish a Research Experiences for                     
              Undergraduates (REU) site at the Rice Quantum Institute (RQI)                  
              of Rice University.  The main objectives are to provide eight                  
              (8) undergraduate students with an opportunity to work during                  
              the summer in an intense, interdisciplinary, collaborative                     
              research environment and to involve them in a program of                       
              discussions and interactions with faculty and graduate                         
              students that will show them both the relationships among                      
              atomic, molecular, optical, and surface sciences and the                       
              technological ramifications of fundamental research in this                    
              area.  Further objectives are to give these undergraduates an                  
              understanding of how atomic, molecular, optical, and surface                   
              science relates to many important technologies and to convey                   
              to them a sense of the real intellectual excitement of this                    
              research and the future for its technological applications.                    
              Each undergraduate will join a research group, undertake a                     
              project that can be completed within the summer, attend                        
              special seminars and group discussions for REU participants,                   
              make a formal report of the project, and participate in the                    
              RQI Research Colloquium at summer's end.  The 32 faculty                       
              fellows of RQI and their groups have considerable                              
              undergraduate involvement in research now; however, this                       
              program will provide additional research opportunities, will                   
              create a coherent educational structure for these students                     
              during the summer, and will allow for tracking the educational                 
              progress and careers of all undergraduates who work with RQI                   
              groups.
