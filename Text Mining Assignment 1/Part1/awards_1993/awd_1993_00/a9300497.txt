Abstract    :
              This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                    
              program in the Chemistry Division has two thrusts, first, the                  
              development of a new multi-reference coupled-cluster approach                  
              for obtaining correlated electronic energies and wave functions                
              for atoms and molecules, and second, the computational                         
              implementation of this new approach in the study of mono- and                  
              dianions of elemental clusters of the elements carbon, silicon,                
              gallium, and arsenic.  The properties of these clusters which                  
              are being studied include their structures, their stable and                   
              metastable photoexcitations, and their photofragmentation                      
              pathways.  These clusters may serve as models for solid                        
              semiconductor systems.                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              The currently available computational methods for describing                   
              the electronic and geometric structures of molecules are in                    
              need of considerable improvement to make them both more                        
              accurate and reliable as well as cheaper to use.  This project                 
              involves just such advances, with applications to the study of                 
              gas-phase clusters comprised of carbon, silicon, gallium, or                   
              arsenic atoms.
