              This proposal between Dr. Bernard Sadoulet,                                    
              University of California, Berkeley and Dr. R.                                  
              Sunyaev, Space Research Institute will support                                 
              a workshop with six leading Russian                                            
              experimentalists to describe several major                                     
              projects in particle astrophysics and                                          
              astronomy.  They will also invite four leading                                 
              Russian theorists to discuss the theoretical                                   
              implications of these projects.  The organizers                                
              envisage a one-day presentation by the Russians                                
              to an audience of potential American                                           
              collaborators, participants in the 16th Texas                                  
              Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics and the                                 
              3rd Particles, Strings, and Cosmology                                          
              Symposium, to be held jointly at Berkeley from                                 
              13-20 December 1992.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This project in particle astrophysics and                                      
              astronomy fulfills the program objective of                                    
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                                     
              leading experts in the United States and                                       
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents                                
              and pool resources in areas of strong mutual                                   
              interest and competence.
