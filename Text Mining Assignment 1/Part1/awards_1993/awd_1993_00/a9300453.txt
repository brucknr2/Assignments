Abstract    :
              A summer research program for undergraduate  students will be                  
              carried out at the Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) for the                 
              summers of 1994, 1995, and 1996.  The program will be available to             
              undergraduates throughout the nation and a strong consideration                
              will be made for women, under-represented minorities, and sophomore            
              students.  This program is a continuation of the Wyoming Infrared              
              Observatory's Summer Undergraduate Research Assistantship Program              
              (SURAP).                                                                       
                                                                                             
              A concurrent seminar/laboratory course will accompany this program             
              to provide direction and a coherent focus on the role this research            
              experience plays toward the student's formal undergraduate                     
              education.  All participants will be required to participate in a              
              group observational project, assist their advisors at the 2.3 meter            
              telescope, encouraged to complete their research within the summer,            
              and participate in the program's objectives to produce publishable             
              results.  A science ethics course will also be required of all                 
              participants.  The Principal Investigator plans to gradually expand            
              SURAP with an "astronomy semester at Wyoming" program to further               
              enhance the total research experience.  The WIRO tutorial in                   
              research has met these goals over the past six years and intends               
              to continue our standard of excellence in the Research Experience              
              for Undergraduates (REU) program.
