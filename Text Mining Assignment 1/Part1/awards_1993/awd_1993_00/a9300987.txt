Abstract    :
              This grant provides renewed support for the Conference of                      
              Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME).  The purpose of                
              the conference is to stimulate discussion and research on the                  
              frontiers of the state-of-the-art of econometric and mathematical              
              economic theory and methodology and the application of advanced                
              mathematical, statistical, and numerical analysis techniques in                
              empirical economic studies.  The conference hastens and improves               
              knowledge and its use, by shortening the time lags between the                 
              conception of ideas and their dissemination and by inducing                    
              leading scholars cooperatively to apply their talents to the                   
              identification, selection, and resolution of issues which are                  
              receiving inadequate attention.  The objectives of CEME are                    
              accomplished by supporting on-going seminars for the exchange of               
              ideas in econometrics and mathematical economics.  CEME seminars               
              provide informal channels of communication among specialists                   
              resident in widely geographically dispersed institutions.  The                 
              seminars provide for more sustained interaction among specialists              
              in selected topic areas than is generally possible at meetings of              
              professional societies.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Since November, 1970, fifteen different seminar groups have been               
              formed, and five are currently active.  The leaders and                        
              participants in the seminars consist of a changing set of                      
              scholars depending on topic and research being conducted in the                
              field.  Meetings of the seminars are planned by the leaders or by              
              other leading researchers chosen by them.  The current active                  
              seminars are general equilibrium models, comparison of                         
              econometric models, time series analysis, Bayesian inference in                
              econometrics and decentralized economic planning.
