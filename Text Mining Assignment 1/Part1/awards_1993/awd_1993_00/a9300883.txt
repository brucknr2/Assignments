Abstract    :
              Electrical transport in semiconductor superlattices and                        
              nanostructures is expected to exhibit strong non-linearities in                
              large, high frequency electric fields.  Such fields and frequencies            
              are available from the Free Electron Laser Facility at UC Santa                
              Barbara.  This research focuses on dynamic localization, quenching             
              of the conductance in the presence of strong, high frequency,                  
              electric fields, and photon assisted tunneling in semiconductor                
              superlattices and multi-quantum wells.  Both vertical and lateral              
              superlattices and nanostructures will be investigated.

              Modern materials synthesis and processing has enabled researchers              
              to fabricate semiconductor structures that are so small that the               
              "wave nature" of the electron controls their electrical properties.            
              These semiconductor nanostructures are characterized by a very non-            
              linear dependence of electron current on applied voltage,                      
              reminiscent of how a transformer works in many everday                         
              applications.  However, this research addresses electrical                     
              responses many millions of times faster than in ordinary                       
              transformers, and hence may lead to the development of new devices             
              which function at frequencies beyond even the radar frequencies                
              common in the aircraft industry.
