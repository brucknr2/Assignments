Abstract    :
              9300045  Bliss  Research outlined here is a continuation of a study initiated in
               1991 on the barren, upland plateau on Devon Island, Canada. This  research
              focuses upon the interactive roles of soil development,  and cryptogamic crust
              and vascular plant establishment and function  in the formation of polar
              deserts. Research on the macroscale  landscape features of crusted and
              non-crusted sites will continue.  This study will be expanded to include the
              mesoscale features of  stone nets and stripes and the role these features play
              in soil  weathering processes, the establishment and nitrogen fixation of 
              cryptogamic crusts, and the transfer of nitrogen from crusts to  soils and
              vascular plants. The the physiological and biomechanical  adaptations of root
              systems to cold, nutrient-poor, frosty  disturbed soils, and the role of carbon
              accumulation and water  rleations of seedlings and adults will be studied as
              these aspects  relate to the limited role of vascular plants within vast areas
              of  polar desert. The large year to year variability provides clues on  how
              this highly stressful system may respond to longer term climate  change. Better
              understanding the response to climate change of  extensive, but little
              understood polar desert systems will  contribute significantly to program goals
              related to the effect of  global changes in the arctic polar environment.  ***
