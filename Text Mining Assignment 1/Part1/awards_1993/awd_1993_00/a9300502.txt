Abstract    :
              This is a Research Planning Grant (RPG)                                        
              submitted in response to NSF 92-90, Research                                   
              Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards                                  
              for Women Scientists and Engineering.  The                                     
              objective of this project is to conduct                                        
              preliminary research on the suitability of                                     
              using fluidized bed combustion ash produced                                    
              during processing of hazardous wastes as a                                     
              binder for solidification and stabilization                                    
              of resultant metal-bearing sludges.                                            
                                                                                             
              Conclusions from this study are expected to                                    
              be used in formulating a project to                                            
              investigate the mechanisms of metal-fixation                                   
              by the ash from the fluidized bed combustion                                   
              process.  These mechanisms are expected to                                     
              provide insight into the rate at which metals                                  
              would leach from landfills and the long-term                                   
              fate of the metals when placed in landfills.
