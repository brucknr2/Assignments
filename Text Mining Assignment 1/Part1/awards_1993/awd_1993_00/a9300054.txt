Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed an experimental study to the development of                     
              particle morphology during drying, including phenomena such as                 
              expansion, bursting, cratering, and formation of internal                      
              bubbles.  The drying rates and the retention or loss of highly                 
              volatile solutes will be investigated.  A video camera will be                 
              used to record changes of drop drying while suspended from a                   
              hollow ceramic fiber, and in a pilot scale dryer.  The project                 
              will have impact on understanding processes in the final drying                
              region of spray dryers.  Besides the improvement of the quality                
              of the final product, the research aims the reduction of the                   
              environmental damage caused by volatile organic chemical release               
              during drying.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              It is expected that the project will lead to improved physical                 
              understanding of drying, with potential practical application in               
              food and chemical processing.
