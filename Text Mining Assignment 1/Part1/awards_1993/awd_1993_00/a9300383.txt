Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert D. Coombe and other members of the Chemistry Department             
              of the University of Denver are being supported to continue a                  
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.               
              For the period 1993-5, eight undergraduate students will spend ten             
              weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research                    
              projects.  Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-                  
              analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A                  
              unique feature of this program is that one of the research areas is            
              on the chemistry of urban atmospheres-a problem area for this                  
              region.
