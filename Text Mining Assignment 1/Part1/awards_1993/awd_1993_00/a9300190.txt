              Grainger    ABSTRACT    The objective of this project is to fabricate novel
              polymeric membranes for the separation of certain nonpolar organics by
              pervaporation.  Central to this new approach for enhanced selectivity of
              electron-rich alkene and arene organic compounds will be the formation of
              electron donor-acceptor complexes between the target molecules and affinity
              species within the membrane.  Moieties like maleimide or phthalimide that form
              complexes with aromatics are to be incorporated into polymer matrix structures.
               Membranes of various derivatized polymers and with differing concentrations of
              these affinity groups will be tested for the separation of styrene and
              ethylbenzene and other industrially important mixtures.    Much of the energy
              requirements in the United States chemical plants and petroleum refineries can
              be attributed to energy losses during distillation.  The development of new
              membranes could allow the substitution of more energy efficient separation
              techniques so that American corporations have lower costs and are better able
              to compete.      ?
