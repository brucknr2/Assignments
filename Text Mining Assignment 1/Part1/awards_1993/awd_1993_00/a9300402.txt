Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              University of Alaska will operate the R/V ALPHA HELIX during 1993              
              as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-funded            
              projects. The R/V ALPHA HELIX is 133' general research vessel owned            
              by the National Science Foundation and constructed in 1966. The                
              ship is scheduled for 167 operating days in 1993, of which 129 days            
              are in support of NSF-sponsored project. The cruises will be                   
              primarily in the north Pacific Ocean but include significant                   
              research cruise legs to the bering and Chukchi Sea regions for                 
              ARCSS research.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This vessel is part of a fleet used by NSF to support oceanographic            
              research. Most oceanographic research requires specialized                     
              equipment that must be permanently installed on the research                   
              vessel. Trained crew members are also required to support the                  
              equipment systems and research operations. This is the first year              
              of a planned three year award.
