Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Texas A&M University will operate the R/V GYRE during 1993            
              as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research            
              projects.  The Gyre is a 182' general research vessel constructed              
              by the US Navy in 1973 and modified in 1980 and 1984.  The Navy is             
              in the process of transferring the title for the vessel to TAMU.               
              The ship is scheduled for 110 operating days in 1993, of which 23              
              days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship operates              
              primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern Atlantic.                     
                                                                                             
                   This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science               
              Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                   
              oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                     
              equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                
              increasing number of research projects require equipment that must             
              be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be              
              specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires highly trained            
              crew members for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not              
              operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and            
              therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels                  
              specifically dedicated to oceanographic research.  These vessels               
              are operated by universities and research institutions around the              
              country.
