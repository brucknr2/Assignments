Abstract    :
              Promising engineering, science and mathematics undergraduate                   
              students nationwide will be invited to participate in a challenging            
              and rewarding program of hands-on, independent research in a                   
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at the University              
              of Wyoming in Laramie.  Qualified women, minorities, and disabled              
              are particularly encouraged to apply.  Eight students per year will            
              be chosen for this summer program, which includes independent                  
              research, formal colloquia on research, close faculty/student                  
              interaction and technical presentations.  Research topics which the            
              students may choose from are in the areas of  Fluid Mechanics and              
              Heat Transfer and involve both laboratory and computer                         
              investigations.  There is an opportunity for participation for more            
              than one year.  A salary stipend, living expenses, and travel                  
              support is being offered.  Four faculty in the College of                      
              Engineering are directly involved in this program.
