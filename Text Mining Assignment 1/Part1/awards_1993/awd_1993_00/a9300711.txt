Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted in two unrelated areas:                 
              turbulence and biophysics.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The statistics of a passive scalar advected by a turbulent velocity            
              field will be studied numerically in two dimensions to guide                   
              analytic theory which has formal analogies to the treatment of band            
              edge tails, and propagation in random gauge fields.  Among the                 
              experimental issues to be addressed are the distribution function              
              of the scalar and its derivative at point and the nonzero value of             
              the derivative skewness in high Reynold's number shear flows.                  
              Scalar transport also arises when the Euler equations are written              
              with Clebsch variables, a representation that may facilitate                   
              understanding why vortex structures form.                                      
                                                                                             
              In the area of cellular biophysics, the dynamics of voltage                    
              sensitive ion channels will be explored based on similarities with             
              solid state systems.  Specifically frequency dependent response and            
              fluctuations will be examined for nonequilibrium effects as well as            
              simultaneous passage of several ions - a sort of Coulomb blockade.             
              The possibility of a collapse transition in a long loop of                     
              negatively supercoiled DNA will be investigated taking proper                  
              account of the thermal fluctuations.                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Theoretical research in condensed matter physics will be conducted             
              focussing on two different condensed matter systems.  One system               
              involves turbulence and related phenomena in the flow of fluids.               
              The other system is biophysical.  The elastic properties of                    
              proteins and conduction across biological membranes will be                    
              studied.
