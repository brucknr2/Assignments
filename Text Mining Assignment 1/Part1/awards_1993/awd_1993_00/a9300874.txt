              year project seeks to document, describe and illustrate the diversity,
              systematics and geographic distribution of the Agaricales (basidiomycete fungi)
              of the Hawaiian Islands.  These fungi play a vital ecological role in nutrient
              cycling in forest communities.  Only 100 species out of an estimated diversity
              of 250 species have been reported from Hawaii.  The primary product will be a
              complete database of all specimens (including distribution, plant associates,
              plant community types), which will contribute to an Agaricales flora of the
              Hawaiian Islands.  The results of the flora will allow the testing of
              hypotheses of island biogeography, vicariance, dispersal and fungal endemism,
              and will contribute to a reconstruction of the biotic history of the Hawaiian
              Islands and the maintenance of its biodiversity.  The degree of urbanization in
              Hawaii makes this project extremely urgent and extremely important to
              conservation planning by land managers.  The fungal collections will be used
              for research and for training students. .%%% This three year project will
              survey, describe and illustrate the diversity and geographic distribution of
              the Agaricales fungi (mushrooms and allies) of the Hawaiian Islands.  These
              fungi play a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling in forest communities,
              yet only 100 species out of an estimated diversity of 250 species have been
              reported from Hawaii.  The primary product of this study will be a complete
              database of all specimens of fungi, their distribution on the islands, their
              particular association with specific plants and their membership in specific
              plant communities.  This database will be issued as a complete, illustrated
              manual.  The results of the survey will also help investigators to reconstruct
              of the biotic history of the Hawaiian Islands and to plan the  maintenance of
              its biodiversity.  The degree of urbanization in Hawaii makes this project
              extremely urgent and extremely important to conservation planning by land
              managers.  The plant collections will be used for research and for training
              students. ***       `     h     p     x   (#
