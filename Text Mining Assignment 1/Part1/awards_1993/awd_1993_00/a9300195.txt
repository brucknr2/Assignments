Abstract    :
              The proposed research program is expected to enhance the                       
              fundamental understanding of loading effects on the engineering                
              behavior of composite soil-nailed systems. It will yield                       
              preliminary model scale data for the experimental evaluation of                
              the design assumptions, and for the engineering assessment of the              
              soil-nailed system performance. It is expected to significantly                
              contribute to improve design practice and, thereby, to increase                
              the confidence of engineers in the potential application of soil               
              nailing as a cost effective engineering solution for                           
              rehabilitation and/or construction of bridge abutments, as well                
              as for remediation and geotechnical construction projects in                   
              built congested urban environments.
