Abstract    :
                   Professors Bramson and Griffeath propose to further the                   
              rigorous theory of various random and deterministic complex                    
              systems in the area of interacting particle systems and random                 
              cellular automata.  These include systems of annihilating random               
              walks and billiards, random and deterministic growth models, and               
              random and deterministic interface dynamics.  The methodology for              
              studying these processes often combines traditional rigorous                   
              mathematical analysis with interactive computer visualization.                 
                   Professors Bramson and Griffeath study random processes                   
              known as interacting particle systems and random cellular                      
              automata. These are "toy universe" models that evolve over time,               
              e.g. on a computer graphics display, offering insights into the                
              behavior of complex dynamics from many areas of applied science.               
              The investigators have two main objectives: to understand the                  
              kinds of aggregate behavior that such dynamics manifest, and to                
              explain how these behaviors arise by using the traditional                     
              analytical techniques, theorems and proofs of mathematics. The                 
              phenomena they study include such fundamental physical processes               
              as contagion, clustering, turbulence, and nucleation.
