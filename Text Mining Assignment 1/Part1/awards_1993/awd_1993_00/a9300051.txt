Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the College of Biological                         
              Sciences are the University of Minnesota to continue a                         
              successful REU Site.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Each summer, 10 undergraduate students will be selected from                   
              a pool of 500-700 applicants to spend ten weeks completing                     
              an independent research project under the direction of one                     
              of the 27 faculty mentors affiliated with the program.  At                     
              least half of the participants will be students of color and                   
              at least half will be from institutions other than the                         
              University of Minnesota.  mentors in this program are basic                    
              scientists who have a common interest in research using                        
              Recombinant DNA technology.  The students' research                            
              experience will be supplemented by weekly student seminars                     
              and a concurrent mini-course in Molecular Biology.  The                        
              course will cover basic principles of prokaryotic and                          
              eukaryotic gene regulation and will provide students with                      
              the most current information on specific topics as well as                     
              background terminology and concepts.  All students will                        
              prepare a summary of their research project in the form of a                   
              display for a poster session at the conclusion of the                          
              program.
