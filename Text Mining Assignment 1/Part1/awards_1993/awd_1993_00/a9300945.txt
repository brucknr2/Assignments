Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Pacific-Antarctic ridge is the key link in the plate                  
              circuit describing the relative motion of the plates of the Pacific            
              basin and the surrounding continental terranes. This project                   
              involves a shipboard survey of critical flowline, at high latitude,            
              crossing the Pacific-Antarctic ridge.  The objectives of the                   
              program are to: (1) construct a high resolution plate kinematic                
              model of the South Pacific for the past 50 Ma; (2) analyze the                 
              temporal evolution of both ridge parallel and fracture zone crustal            
              morphology; (3) model the deep structure of fracture zone FZ XII               
              using combine Geosat, Hydrosweep, and gravity data; and (4)                    
              evaluate the contributions of chemical remnant magnetization and               
              thermo-viscous magnetization to the source of marine magnetic                  
              anomalies.
