Abstract    :
              9300134 Turner          The objectives of this research are to develop a sound
              base  of science and technology for the variational analysis of designs using
              solid assembly models, and to  contribute to the technology transfer of these
              ideas into industrial practice.  The major research goals are:  exploitation of
              solid assembly models so that designer interaction is minimized; accurate
              computational mathematization of the geometric tolerances described in the ANSI
              tolerancing standard; development of explicit statistical (process) models as a
              formal way ofd capturing and utilizing process information; technology transfer
              into industrial practice through CAD integration.  This research addresses
              nonlinear statistical tolerance analysis, tolerance synthesis, and tolerance
              representation.          Advances in design automation technologies for
              variational analysis can make a major contribution to the competitiveness of
              American manufacturing industries.  These research efforts will establish a
              sound modern basis for the development of software technologies that can make
              an important contribution to the competitiveness of American manufacturing
              industries.  Product models based on solid modeling technology are rapidly
              achieving acceptance, and geometric tolerances are now a national standard. 
              Improved software technologies which incorporate variational analysis
              capabilities into the product design process, will provide American industry
              with the ability to develop higher quality products, at lower costs, and with
              reduced product development time. ***
