Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Richard P.Steiner and other members of the Chemistry Department            
              of the University of Utah are being supported to continue a                    
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.               
              For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students will spend ten               
              weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research                    
              projects.  Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-                  
              analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A                  
              unique feature of this program is the focus on a nationwide effort             
              to attract women and minority students, particularly through                   
              contacts with Historically Black colleges and institutions with                
              large hispanic populations.
