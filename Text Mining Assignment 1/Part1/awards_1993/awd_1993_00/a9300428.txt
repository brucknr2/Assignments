Abstract    :
              The Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at the                     
              University of Central Florida will expose ten undergraduate                    
              students, chosen from institutions throughout the Southeast to                 
              thirteen weeks of research experiences in the development and                  
              applications of lasers.  A primary emphasis of this program will               
              be to encourage talented undergraduate students, in particular                 
              women, minorities, and persons with disabilities, to pursue                    
              graduate studies in the field of electro-optics and lasers.  Eight             
              internationally recognized faculty in the Center for Research in               
              Electro-Optics and Lasers (CREOL), which is a recognized center of             
              excellence in optics and laser research, will be Research                      
              Supervisors in this program.  The program will include: 1) An                  
              introductory course in the basic principals of optics and lasers;              
              2) A course on laser systems; 3) Weekly Research Seminars by the               
              CREOL faculty and other experts organized specifically for the REU             
              students; 4) Biweekly industrial visits to the numerous optics and             
              laser companies in the Orlando area; 5) Weekly classes and                     
              discussion sessions on issues of ethics in science and engineering             
              research; 6) Continuous monitoring of the students' progress by the            
              principal investigators.  All of the activities will take place in             
              the summer term of 1993.
