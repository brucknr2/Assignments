Abstract    :
                   This REU site project will support six undergraduate                      
              students engaged in faculty directed research at Texas Christian               
              University.  The activity will run for an eight-week period.                   
              Students will focus their studies on research problems in                      
              computational group theory and graph theory, centering on the                  
              study of groups arising from sliding block puzzles.  The research              
              will require some knowledge of computers and of the abstract                   
              algebra software GAP, which the students will acquire during the               
              project in a self-contained orientation.  Students will be                     
              expected to produce papers detailed the results of their work.                 
              They will be encouraged to give presentations at mathematics                   
              meeting during the academic year; in addition, papers of                       
              exceptional merit will be prepared for publication in appropriate              
              journals.
