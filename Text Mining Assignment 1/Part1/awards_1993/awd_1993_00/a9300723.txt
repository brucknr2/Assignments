Abstract    :
              9300723  Cohen         This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral 
              Dissertation Research program.  This questionnaire study of 100  product
              development teams, uses an open systems framework to  examine the effects of
              organizational structure and team processes  on team effectiveness.  Hypotheses
              to be tested concern the  dependence of the teams on the organizations,
              uncertainty  characterizing work of the teams, differences between teams and 
              organizations with respect to institutional environments, problems  at the
              team-organization interface, and mechanisms that facilitate  relations between
              team and organization.         This study will test a number of hypotheses
              about teams of  workers within larger organizations, thus contributing both to 
              scientific knowledge in the fields of small group relations and  formal
              organizations and to the productivity of American industry.   In addition to
              the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,  this award will
              materially assist a highly promising student in  completing research for the
              Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it  contributes to the future scientific manpower of
              the nation and the  thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
