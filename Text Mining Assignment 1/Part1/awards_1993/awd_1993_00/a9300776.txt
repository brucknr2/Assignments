Abstract    :
              9300776  Klumpar  The propagation of transient impulses induced into the 
              magnetosphere/ionosphere system.  The investigation will use  already exiting
              data from ground stations located below the high  latitude dayside ionosphere
              taken in time conjunction with  satellite data from the outer dayside
              magnetosphere (primarily the  AMPTE/Charge Composition Explorer).  The focus is
              on cause and  effect relationships between a specific class of impulsive (3 -
              10  minute) high latitude dayside ionospheric signatures and their 
              simultaneously observed magnetopause and boundary layer  counterparts. 
              Understanding this relationship is an essential  element of the GEM Boundary
              Layer Campaign.  We hope to learn to  interpret the ionospheric signatures in
              terms of corresponding  variations at the frontal magnetosphere.  ***
