Abstract    :
                  The underlying objective of the GEM program is a understand the  structure
              and dynamics of the terrestrial plasma environment to  such a degree that a
              global model of this environment with  predictive capabilities can be
              constructive.  This objective is to  be accomplished through a series of
              focussed campaigns, the first  of which concentrated on the coupling of the
              solar wind to the  magnetopause, its boundary layers and the ionosphere.  The
              proposed  effort is to coordinate this campaign through workshops,  newsletters
              and various collaborative studies.  At the present  level of support the
              efforts of about 70 researchers are being  coordinated with the assistance of
              two other coordinators.  As a  result of these efforts, we will reach a
              significantly improved  understanding of how the solar wind supplies energy to
              the  magnetosphere.  This improved understanding is important for the 
              operations of our increasingly sophisticated technological systems  which much
              operate in this environment.
