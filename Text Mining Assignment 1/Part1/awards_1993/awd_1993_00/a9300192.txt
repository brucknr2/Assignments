Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Klee to work                
              in combinatorics.  During the proposed research period, the                    
              emphasis will be in an area that has in recent years been called               
              "computational Convexity".  It forms an interface that involves                
              aspects of convex geometry, discrete mathematics, computer                     
              science, and operations research.  In essence, it is the study of              
              the computational and algorithmic aspects of high-dimensional                  
              convex bodies (essentially polytopes).                                         
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
