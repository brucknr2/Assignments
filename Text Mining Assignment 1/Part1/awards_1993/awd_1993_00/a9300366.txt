Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two important directions provide the focus of this research.                   
              One goal is to achieve high quantum efficiency photoluminescence               
              from conjugated polymers in solution and in solid thin films.  Such            
              highly efficient luminescent polymer films are intended for use in             
              light-emitting diodes (LEDs) fabricated from conducting polymers.              
              The other is to study high quantum efficiency charge separation                
              in conjugated polymer-"buckyball" composites and in p-n                        
              heterojunctions made from conjugated polymer-"buckyball" bilayers.             
              The photoinduced charge transfer is analogous to the key step in               
              artificial photosynthesis.  A deeper understanding of the science              
              offers the potential for low-cost efficient solar energy conversion            
              from solar cells fabricated from such heterojunctions.                         
                                                                                             
              Conducting polymers are now available as materials with unique                 
              properties:  the important electronic and optical properties of                
              semiconductors and metals in combination with the attractive                   
              mechanical properties and the processing advantages of polymers.               
              The research will provide basic scientific research on the quantum             
              chemistry and physics of the pi-electrons in conjugated polymers               
              for LEDs and artificial photosynthesis.
