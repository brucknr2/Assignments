Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates program addresses the             
              need to expose undergraduate students to the tools and techniques              
              used in the interdisciplinary, and highly dynamic field of                     
              microelectronics at Florida International University.  A sample                
              project of a superconducting magnometer will be developed.  The                
              undergraduates will be exposed to a variety of disciplines,                    
              including material science, mechanics, thermal science and                     
              electrical and electronic engineering.  Multilevel structures of               
              superconducting materials will be fabricated using tape cast films.            
              The electromagnetic characteristics will be investigated by                    
              students at Florida A&M University.  The entire packaging of the               
              magnetometer ensuring stable thermal performance and structural                
              rigidity, will also be developed.  This comprehensive research                 
              experience will entail broad exposure to methods of literature                 
              search, problem definition and formulation in these areas,                     
              technical report writing, laboratory set-ups, culminating in                   
              specific problem application.  The combination of a historically               
              black university (Florida A&M) and a minority institution (Florida             
              International) is a special, unique feature of this program.
