Abstract    :
                   The R/V THOMPSON has a full schedule for 1993, with its                   
              primary focus on the U.S.World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)             
              program in the Pacific.  Four cruises are planned for a total of               
              151 days.  In addition, cruises are planned for Collier's mooring              
              recovery for the JGOFS program, Kulm's study of the convergent                 
              margin and Von Herzen's heat flow as a fault plane stress                      
              indicator, totaling 72 days.  The University of Washington will use            
              50 days of THOMPSON time to provide instruction for graduate and               
              undergraduate students in oceanography during extended transit                 
              legs.                                                                          
                   The R/V BARNES has a light schedule of 61 operating days in               
              1993.  Six NSF programs will be provided a total of 44 days of ship            
              time all within the inland waters of the Puget Sound region.                   
              Thirteen days of state-funded cruises for academic instruction are             
              planned, and commercial use of the vessel is projected at a level              
              of four days.  Because of the light schedule and an effort to                  
              maintain the BARNES the crewing will be restructured.
