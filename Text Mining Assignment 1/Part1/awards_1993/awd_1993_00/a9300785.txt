Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of citizen discourse             
              concerning the 1990 Iraq War, based on transcripts of recorded                 
              radio and television talk programs.  To examine the impact of elite            
              discourse, primarily the words of political leaders, on citizen                
              speech, this research project will analyze the narrative structure,            
              to use of symbols and ideographs, and the characteristics of key               
              figure.  In addition, an institutional analysis will develop both              
              an empirical and theoretical account of the radio talk call-in show            
              and its relationship to American public life.                                  
                                                                                             
                   This study will systematically examine an important new arena             
              of social and political debate in the United States, to learn how              
              powerfully the words of societal leaders shape the ways ordinary               
              citizens express themselves and to chart the structure and function            
              of this new cultural institution.  In addition to the scientific               
              gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially               
              assist a highly promising student in completing research for the               
              Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to future scientific                  
              manpower and the thorough training of the next generation of                   
              sociologists.
