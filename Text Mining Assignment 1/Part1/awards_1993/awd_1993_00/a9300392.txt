Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Division of Medical                           
              Sciences at Harvard University to continue a successful                        
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates SITE.  The Division                    
              supervises Ph.D. training programs of the Graduate School of                   
              Arts and Sciences for students who are engaged in biological                   
              research in laboratories on the Medical School campus. This                    
              10 week summer research program will support 10                                
              undergraduate students working in the fields of microbial                      
              biochemistry and genetic regulation.  A research-related                       
              course, a student-faculty research seminar series that will                    
              include discussions of ethical issues related to the project                   
              focus, and a career development discussion series will                         
              accompany the laboratory research.  Students will be                           
              recruited from a nation-wide pool, with a particular                           
              emphasis on recruiting qualified minority students and                         
              women. They will have the opportunity to carry out projects                    
              in the laboratories of any of 17 Division faculty who are                      
              participating in this program. The undergraduates will also                    
              be provided with opportunities to meet other majority and                      
              minority research faculty and graduate students, in both                       
              academic and social settings.
