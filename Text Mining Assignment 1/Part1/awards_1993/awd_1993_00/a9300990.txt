Abstract    :
              Precast concrete frames using beam elements connected to                       
              multi-story column elements with post-tensioned prestressing                   
              tendons has been identified as an economically viable method                   
              of construction for tall buildings.  Recent research has                       
              indicated that beam-column joint subassemblages using fully                    
              grouted tendons developed ductility comparable to monolithic                   
              reinforced concrete subassemblages designed to current                         
              specifications.  But the tendons often suffer excessive                        
              stiffness degradation at low displacements after moderate                      
              ductility levels had been chieved.  This was caused by a                       
              reduction of effective prestress clamping force through the                    
              column, resulting from inelastic strain of the prestressing                    
              tendon at the critical section.                                                
                                                                                             
              This project conducts a pilot study to experimentally                          
              verify a new concept for connecting precast seismic frames                     
              using unbonded prestressing tendons.  The tendons will                         
              connect precast beam and column sections which allows a                        
              nonlinear elastic response and achieves a considerable                         
              displacement capacity.  This capacity is free from                             
              problems associated with permanent deformation, thus                           
              enable the joint shear capacity to be enhanced without the                     
              need for extensive joint shear reinforcement.                                  
                                                                                             
              Two large scale  test units representing an external and an                    
              internal connections respectively will be constructed and                      
              tested under cyclic lateral deformations using the existing                    
              pseudo-dynamic testing facility at University of                               
              California, San Diego.  Conservative transverse                                
              reinforcement details will be chosen and heavily strain                        
              gauged.  It is expected that recommendations for reduced                       
              reinforcement will be made and verification of the concept                     
              will be achieved from the experimental research.                               
                                                                                             
              This project is supported under the provision of Small                         
              Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) program.
