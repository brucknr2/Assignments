Abstract    :
              The Civil Engineering Department at North Carolina State University            
              (NCSU) is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site for ten               
              undergraduate students who will be assigned to research projects               
              throughout the department under the supervision of the research                
              faculty.  In addition, NCSU has a specific goal of attracting at               
              least six women and minorities for this program.  Applicants will              
              be selected on a competitive basis in a nationwide search with                 
              particular emphasis being given to those students in the SUCCEED               
              Coalition and HBCUs including Hampton, Howard, Morgan State,                   
              Prairie View A&M, Southern, Tennessee State, and Tuskegee.                     
              Additional applicants from NCSU's Engineering Scholars Program will            
              be sought to participate in the REU site program.  The objective               
              of the program is to motivate students to pursue graduate study by             
              sharing with them the excitement, rewards, and work involved in a              
              research experience.
