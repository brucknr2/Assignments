Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An experimental study for assessment of the applicability of laser-            
              induced second harmonic generation (SHG) for measurement of                    
              temperatures of hot metallic surfaces will be carried out.  The                
              immediate goal of this research is to obtain sufficient data to                
              either eliminate SHG as a candidate diagnostic or create further               
              interest in the development of SHG thermometry.  In this study, the            
              main surface of interest will be platinum (rough and polished                  
              surfaces) deposited on a tantalum or ceramic substrate.  Three                 
              separate research tasks will be performmed.  First, a repeatable               
              calibration plot of SHG signal versus temperature at surface                   
              temperatures from 300 to 1000 K will be sought using samples heated            
              in an electric furnace, with (hopefully) demonstration that the                
              relative SHG signal is independent of surface roughness.  Next, the            
              calibration plot will be extended to 1800 K in either a high-                  
              temperature furnace or a combustion environment.  Finally, dynamic             
              response of the SHG measurement technique will be investigated.                
                                                                                             
              The ultimate goal of the proposed research direction is development            
              of SHG thermometry for practical high-temperature applications in              
              the fields of combustion, heat transfer, and materials processing,             
              with particular application to on-line control of manufacturing                
              facilities.
