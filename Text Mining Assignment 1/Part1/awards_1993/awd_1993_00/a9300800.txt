Abstract    :
              This award will support the purchase of a computer                             
              workstation for the investigator, so that he may extend the                    
              complexity as well as the length of his studies.  The                          
              investigator will study processes of population change and                     
              ecological patterns via computer simulations.  The                             
              simulations are produced by machine code algorithms.  In the                   
              process of these studies, the investigator will also be                        
              investigating means of developing (evolving) software for                      
              massively parallel machines.
