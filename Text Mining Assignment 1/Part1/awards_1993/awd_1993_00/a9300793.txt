Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of educational                   
              transitions in the physical sciences and engineering among women               
              and minorities, following a life course perspective.  One dataset              
              will be an existing longitudinal survey of young people, called                
              High School and Beyond, which tracks the life histories of 60,000              
              high school students interviewed at two year intervals throughout              
              the 1980s.  Another dataset will be assembled by the present                   
              investigators from a sample of entering students in a large school             
              of engineering, and will permit closer examination of social-                  
              psychological factors that shape careers in engineering.                       
                                                                                             
                   This study will contribute to the sociology of science,                   
              gender, minorities, and careers, and it will also provide important            
              information for deciding public policy concerning the scientific               
              and engineering workforce.  In addition to the scientific gains to             
              be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a               
              highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.                  
              dissertation.  Thus it contributes to future scientific manpower               
              and the thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
