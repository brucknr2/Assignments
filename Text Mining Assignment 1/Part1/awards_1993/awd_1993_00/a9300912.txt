Abstract    :
              9300912  VanDooren  Block international travel funds  are requested for the 10TH
               International Symposium on the  Mathematical Theory of Networks and  Systems
              (MTNS-93) to be held in  Regensburg Germany from August 2-6,  l993.  MTNS is
              one of the world's  most important conferences on the  mathematical foundations
              of network  and systems and their applications.   The Regensburg location will
              be the  4th time MTNS has been held in  Europe and the 6th time outside the 
              United States.  The requested funds  will be instrumental in improving  the
              technical success of the  conference by enabling  participation of sufficient
              numbers  of key U.S. authors.  ***
