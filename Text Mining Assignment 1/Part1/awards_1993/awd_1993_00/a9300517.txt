              wasps are the second largest family of wasps (more than 10,000 species) and are
              widely used in the biological control of  insect pests.  Although they are a
              significant component of neotropical ecosystems, little is known of their
              biodiversity in Latin American habitats.  This three year project will compile
              a complete guide to the New World braconid parasitic wasps and will be issued
              in three languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese).  The manual will be used
              primarily by Latin American conservationists, land managers, agriculturalists
              and scientists who are not specialists in wasp systematics, and will include
              parasitoid biologies, behavior, geographic distribution , patterns of host
              utilization and relevant literature. %%% This three year project will compile a
              complete guide to a New World group of parasitic wasps that are widely used in
              the biological control of  insect pests.  Although these wasps are a
              significant component of neotropical ecosystems, little is known of their
              biodiversity in Latin American habitats    a gap that this project aims to
              fill.  This collaborative effort involves eight specialists in the US and South
              America, including the training of students from Latin American countries
              (Mexico, Costa Rica) and four training workshops to be held in Mexico, Costa
              Rica, and Venezuela in wasp systematics and biodiversity.  The identification
              manual    to be issued in three languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese)   
              will be used primarily by Latin American conservationists, land managers,
              agriculturalists and scientists who are not specialists in wasp systematics.
