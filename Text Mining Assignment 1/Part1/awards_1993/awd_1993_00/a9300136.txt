Abstract    :
                   The investigators plan to develop new techniques for                      
              obtaining  approximations to the performance measures of queueing              
              systems.  The new asymptotic and singular perturbation techniques              
              will be applied to a wide variety of equations, such as                        
              difference, integral and differential-difference equations, that               
              arise in these models.  The methods are based on the WKB method,               
              boundary layer analysis and matched asymptotic expansions.  New                
              nontrivial extensions of theses methods have previously been                   
              developed and have been shown to yield remarkably accurate                     
              results.                                                                       
                   The new approximations developed by the investigators will                
              be directly applicable to models of large computer and                         
              communications systems.  In such systems, customers (computer                  
              jobs, voice messages, data packets, or video images) contend for               
              limited system resources.  The behavior of these systems is                    
              measured by performance measures such as throughput and response               
              time.  To design new systems, it important that analytic models                
              be analyzed to assess system operating characteristics.
