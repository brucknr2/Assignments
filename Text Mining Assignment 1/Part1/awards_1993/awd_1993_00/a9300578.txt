Abstract    :
              A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site for New Directions              
              in Chemical Engineering is designed for ten undergraduate students             
              at Purdue.  The students will receive a ten week research                      
              experience in three major areas of chemical engineering: 1)                    
              polymers and materials; 2) adsorption science and engineering; and             
              3) process systems engineering.  Students will be recruited from               
              a variety of colleges and universities - particularly from smaller             
              midwestern colleges that do not have major research programs and               
              with an emphasis on historically underrepresented groups.  Student             
              projects will be managed to provide a balanced experience in which             
              they will be exposed to and work with tools and techniques at the              
              forefront of modern engineering research.  The students will have              
              direct and frequent contact with both faculty and graduate                     
              students.  They will participate in weekly research seminars,                  
              prepare written reports describing the methodologies, results, and             
              conclusions of their projects, and give oral presentations of their            
              work in a colloquium at the end of the project.  The students'                 
              future progress and professional plans will be monitored and                   
              analyzed to suggest optimal ways to enlarge the pool of research-              
              oriented undergraduates for advanced studies and industrial                    
              research and development.
