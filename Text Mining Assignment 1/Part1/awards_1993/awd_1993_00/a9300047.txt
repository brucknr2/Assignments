Abstract    :
              Dr. Vicki H. Grassian and other members of the Chemistry Department            
              of University of Iowa are being supported to continue a Research               
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the               
              period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each            
              summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                     
              Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,                  
              inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature of            
              this program is the focus on women and minority students.
