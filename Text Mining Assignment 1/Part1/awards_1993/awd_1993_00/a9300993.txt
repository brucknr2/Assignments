Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Florida in the purchase of a quantum chemical visualization                    
              system.  Specific areas of research include:                                   
                                                                                             
              1)  Time-dependent methods for scattering, reactions, and the                  
              dynamical evolution of molecular properties,                                   
              2)  Semi-empirical treatment of extremely large molecules such                 
              as neurotoxins, including solvent effects via self-consistent                  
              reaction fields,                                                               
              3)  Novel applications and enhancements of density functional                  
              theory for prediction of properties of ultra-thin                              
              (quasi-molecular) films,                                                       
              4)  Predictive calculation of polymer structures for synthesis                 
              to realize large conductivities and possible superconductivity,                
              5)  Development of methods, algorithms and software to                         
              visualize, rapidly and effectively, the data obtained in the                   
              above projects.                                                                
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The computer hardware and software in the quntum mechanical                    
              visualization systems allows one to simulate interactions that                 
              take place in molecules in a real laboratory environment and to                
              present these interactions in a visual manner.
