Abstract    :
                   This grant supports Professor Elliott to work in the area of              
              probabilistic number theory.  Specifically, this proposal is to                
              study the values of arithmetic functions on prescribed sequences of            
              arithmetic interest.  Besides their own merit, such functions bear             
              upon problems in algebra, and apply to the study of algorithms for             
              the factorization of large integers, and so to cryptography.                   
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number theory            
              starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                        
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
