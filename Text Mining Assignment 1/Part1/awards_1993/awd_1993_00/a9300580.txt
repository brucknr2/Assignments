Abstract    :
                   This project will bring ten undergraduates per summer to the              
              University of Kansas campus to work with the Department of                     
              Electrical and Computer Engineering.  The projects will be                     
              conducted in a ten week period in the summers of 1993, 1994, 1995.             
              No more than two of the student participants per summer will be                
              from the University of Kansas.  The students will be working on                
              existing research teams within the program.  Special emphasis in               
              the program is in the areas of microwave remote sensing, computer              
              architecture, digital signal processing, artificial intelligence,              
              telecommunications and networking, and very-large-scale-                       
              integration circuit design.
