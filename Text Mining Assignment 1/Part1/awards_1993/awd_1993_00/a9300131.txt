Abstract    :
              9300131  Pesek  This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project which 
              is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program  focuses on the
              analytical chemistry of materials and surfaces.  During the tenure of this
              thirty-six month standard grant,  Professor Pesek and his colleagues at San
              Jose State University  (SJSU) will join with their counterpart staff scientists
              at the  IBM Almaden Research Center (IBM/ARC) to develop a unique 
              academic/industrial research and training program.  This  activity will bring
              together graduate students, undergraduate  students, small college faculty, and
              high school teachers to  participate in cooperative research projects which are
               co-directed by SJSU and IBM/ARC scientists.  The focus of each  of the
              projects is the chemistry and characterization of  surfaces and materials. 
              Each of the participants will spend  time working in laboratories both at SJSU
              and IBM/ARC, thereby  enabling them to gain a perspective on academic as well
              as  industrial research and how cooperation can work to the benefit  of the two
              organizations.  %%%  Participants in this cooperative research activity are
              expected  to gain an enhanced appreciation of basic and applied research  which
              should encourage the students to continue on for advanced  degrees, the small
              college faculty to begin or more actively  pursue projects at their home
              institutions thereby sharing the  excitement of research and discovery with
              their students, and  the high school teachers to motivate more of their own
              students  to consider science as a career.  ***
