Abstract    :
              9300274  The study of the dynamics and thermodynamics of the upper  atmospheric
              regions including the mesosphere and the thermosphere  must be done on a global
              scale because of the central importance of  horizontal transport and coupling
              of the dynamics and  thermodynamics of these regions.  Most of the
              investigations of  these regions of the upper atmosphere have been made in the 
              Northern Hemisphere while investigations in the Southern Hemisphere  are most
              recent.  Because of the geographical constraints, the  studies of the austral
              upper atmosphere necessitate international  cooperation.    This proposal
              specifically requests support for the operation of an  optical high-resolution
              spectrometer at the University of  Canterbury's Mount John Astronomical
              Observatory (45oS, South  Island, New Zealand) in conjunction with the
              University of  Canterbury's mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MALT) partial- 
              reflection radar located nearby.  This station is part of a  Southern
              Hemisphere collaborative international program to  investigate the austral
              upper atmosphere, and includes optical and  radar stations in New Zealand
              (Mount John and Birdlings Flat),  Australia (Beveridge and Adelaide) and
              Antarctica (South Pole,  Scott Base, Mawson and Halley Bay).  Mount John,
              operated by the  Universities of Canterbury, Washington and Alaska under the
              US/NZ  Cooperative Science Program auspices, is strategically located to  study
              the upper atmosphere dynamics and thermodynamics of the  transition region
              between mid and high latitudes in the Southern  Hemisphere.  The observations
              obtained will be interpreted with the aid from  simulations provided from the
              time-dependent NCAR coupled  thermosphere and ionosphere global circulation
              model (TIGCM).  ***
