Abstract    :
               Proof construction is a pervasive activity in computing   mathematics. 
              Although techniques for automated reasoning   made it possible to prove
              theorems with extreme rigor, much   the past effort has been directed towards
              proving difficult,  interesting, and often well-known theorems using general- 
              purpose   logics and proof techniques.  The application of  automated reasoning
              technology to support formal methods in  software engineering has fallen well
              short of original  expectations.  The main reason for this failure is the 
              overriding emphasis on automatic theorem proving.  A  completely new approach
              is required where the focus must   from theorems to proofs, and from
              general-purpose language   inference mechanisms to well-integrated,
              domain-specific  mechanisms.  Any sufficiently rich application domain, such  
              hardware, real-time, concurrent, or fault-tolerant systems,  exploits a host of
              specialized formalisms in order to encode  important concepts and methods and
              to reduce complexity.    project develops multi-modal framework for interactive
               proof construction to support the use of domain-specific  formalisms.  The
              envisaged application is to reason about  complex digital systems.
