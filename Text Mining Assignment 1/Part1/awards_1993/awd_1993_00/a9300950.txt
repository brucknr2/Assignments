Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral              
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of how  intra-elite              
              competition and alliances in the state of Pernambuco in the early              
              19th  century influenced the development of the Brazilian  state.              
              The  research involves documentary research in local and regional              
              archives  in  Brazil.   Results will  be  analyzed  in  terms  of              
              competing theories of state formation.                                         
                                                                                             
                    This  research  will  contribute  to  a  rapidly-developing              
              literature on the emergence of the modern nation state, providing              
              data  on  how a centralized state emerges partly as a  result  of              
              political competition and pressure from below, rather that simply              
              through  vigorous  imposition from above.   In  addition  to  the              
              scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award  will              
              materially  assist  a  highly  promising  student  in  completing              
              research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to  the              
              future  scientific  manpower of the  national  and  the  thorough              
              training of the next generation of sociologists.
