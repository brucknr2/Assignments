Abstract    :
              Boston University's Manufacturing Engineering Department is                    
              continuing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program which             
              provides support for undergraduates to participate in research in              
              the area of modeling, analysis, and control of engineering systems.            
              The program emphasizes flexible manufacturing systems, robotics,               
              and process control.  The Manufacturing Engineering Department                 
              believes that research experiences provide excellent education                 
              opportunities for undergraduates.  By getting involved in research             
              activities, undergraduates can be better interactive with graduate             
              students and faculty.  They can also be exposed to real problems               
              and be more motivated.
