Abstract    :
              Research in Particulate Systems Engineering is crucial to advances             
              in combustion, atmospheric and environmental sciences, indoor air              
              quality, nuclear reactor safety, and materials manufacturing.  The             
              purpose of this program is to provide research experiences for 12              
              undergraduate students each year in this area at the University of             
              Missouri-Columbia (UMC) during the summers of 1993, 1994, and 1995.            
              At least half of the students each year will be selected from                  
              institutions other than UMC, with several recruited from Stephen's             
              College (a women's college), Lincoln University (HBCU), and other              
              undergraduate schools in the state.  Each student will undertake               
              a specific research project, and a faculty advisor will work with              
              the student to develop his/her research skills.  An essential                  
              element of the program will be its emphasis on professional                    
              development of the students.  The purpose is to infuse bright                  
              undergraduate students with an enthusiasm towards research careers,            
              including graduate level education.
