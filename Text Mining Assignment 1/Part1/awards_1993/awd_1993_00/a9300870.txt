Abstract    :
                   The primary goal of Professor Smith's project is to obtain                
              from satellite data estimates of the distribution of vertical                  
              heating over the southwest portion of the monsoon region in East               
              Asia for a three year period.  The project involves the development            
              of new retrieval algorithms for Special Sensor Microwave/Imager                
              (SSM/I) data.  Estimates of precipitating rain and ice are produced            
              from which latent heating profiles are deduced.  These estimates,              
              combined with satellite-derived radiative cooling estimates, will              
              then be used to analyze the meridional circulation and atmospheric             
              energy budgets in the region.  In addition, Professor Smith will               
              examine the heat sources and sinks over the Tibetan and Mongolian              
              Plateaus.                                                                      
                   Dr. Smith is one of a very few university scientists working              
              on the critically area.  Research of this type is essential if we              
              are to realize the potential for remotely sensed information from              
              satellites.
