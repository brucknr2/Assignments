Abstract    :
                   This project focuses on mathematical research in the area of              
              special functions and their applications to a multiplicity of                  
              scientific questions.  Among the most important special functions              
              which arise in applications fall within the general class of                   
              hypergeometric functions, which, for example, have recently found              
              their way into the theory of quantum groups.  In addition to                   
              linear and linear fractional transformations, some of these                    
              functions have quadratic or higher transformations.  Quadratic                 
              transformations have been studied for two centuries and are                    
              reasonably well understood.  Cubic transformations were first                  
              discovered by Riemann over 125 years ago, yet they are not as                  
              well understood as comments in the literature lead one to think,               
              and while applications of them have been limited, there are some               
              recent very interesting ones which go back to work of Ramanujan.               
              These transformations will be analyzed.  Efforts will be made to               
              find multivariable extensions.                                                 
                   Special functions are fundamental building blocks used in                 
              the approximation of complex functions, as solutions of                        
              differential equations and in the representation of many                       
              important mathematical and physical relationships.  In addition                
              to their recurrence in often unexpected ways throughout science,               
              they generally are easy to compute or approximate numerically.
