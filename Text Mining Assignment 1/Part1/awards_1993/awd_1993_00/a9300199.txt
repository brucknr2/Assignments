Abstract    :
              Dr. Lorraine W. Deck and other members of the Chemistry Department             
              of the University of New Mexico are being supported to continue a              
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.               
              For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students will spend ten               
              weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research                    
              projects.  Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-                  
              analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A                  
              unique feature of this program is the recruiting of most of the                
              students from other institutions where research programs are                   
              limited, particularly the many small ones in the southwestern U.S.             
              which lack comprehensive research programs and facilities.
