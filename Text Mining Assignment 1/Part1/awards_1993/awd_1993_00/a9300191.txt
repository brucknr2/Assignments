Abstract    :
                   Tree-indexed processes are a way of studying classical                    
              tree-related probability models in a unified and more powerful                 
              way.  Examples of such models are: branching random walk,                      
              branching Markov chains, first passage percolation on a tree,                  
              parallel searches, random and non-random Cantor sets and                       
              hyperbolic manifolds.  Current work on tree-indexed processes is               
              focused on extending some results on Hausdorff dimensions of                   
              random sets and on determining exact capacity criteria for                     
              subsets of the range space to be polar for a given tree-indexed                
              process.                                                                       
                   Probability models with branching or tree structure arise in              
              many areas of science.  Much of the classical work on branching                
              processes was motivated by random family trees that arise in                   
              population genetics; the theory of cascades encompasses atomic                 
              chain reactions and rainfall models; more recently, random trees               
              have been used to study self-similarity (fractal behavior) in                  
              spatial models.  By abstracting the common structure of these                  
              models into "tree-indexed processes", we have been able to prove               
              many new results about this class of models, as well as                        
              strengthening previously known results.
