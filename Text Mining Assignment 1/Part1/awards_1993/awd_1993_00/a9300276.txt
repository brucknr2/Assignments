Abstract    :
              This work will focus on the total synthesis of a diverse group                 
              of important natural products and on the development of new                    
              synthetic methodology.  Synthetic targets include: oleanolic                   
              acid, miroestrol, paeoniflorin, prostaglandin H2, lactacystin,                 
              ovalicin, cassioside, epibatidine and brefeldin A.  The                        
              methodology topics chosen include: enantioselective addition of                
              vinyl and alkynyl groups to aldehydes and ketones,                             
              enantioselective reduction of ketones, syntheses of chiral                     
              oxiranes, catalytic syntheses of new chiral controller groups,                 
              exploratory chemistry of chiral oxazaaluminolidines and chiral                 
              cationc oxazaborolidines, exploratory research on new titanium                 
              (IV) complexes as enantioselective catalysts, use of amino-acid                
              derived catalysts for enantioselective synthesis and new                       
              methodology for the preparation of medium- and large-ring                      
              terpenoids.

              With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Elias J. Corey of the Department                
              of Chemistry at Harvard University.  Professor Corey will focus                
              his work on the synthesis of several naturally occurring and                   
              biologically active complex organic molecules. He will also                    
              pursue the development of new synthetic methodology
