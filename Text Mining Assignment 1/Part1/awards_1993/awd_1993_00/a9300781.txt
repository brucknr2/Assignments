Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this research, the unique technique of differential ac free-                
              standing film calorimetry is used to measure the heat capacity of              
              free-standing liquid crystal films and other liquid crystal                    
              mesophases.  This technique allows investigation of two-dimensional            
              physical phenomena without the complicating effects of a substrate.            
              Because of its extremely high resolution (better than 1 in                     
              100,000), it is possible to obtain high-quality heat capacity data             
              from the two-layer films, and acquire information on unexpected                
              layer-by-layer transition sequence near the smectic-A-hexatic B                
              transition of several liquid crystal compounds.  In addition, high-            
              resolution optical reflectivity experiments (better than 5 in                  
              10,0000) are coupled to the calorimetric measurements to allow                 
              simultaneous measurements of heat capacity and optical reflectivity            
              of various liquid films and other liquid crystal mesophases.  The              
              proposed work will enable one to test important theoretical                    
              predictions related to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-type transition in              
              two dimensions, and will provide new insights into the physics of              
              two-dimensional substrate-free systems.

              A state of art differential ac calorimeter developed in this                   
              research is used to measure the heat capacity of free-standing                 
              liquid crystal films (similar to soap films on a ring) as thin as              
              two molecular layers.  This unique technique offers new                        
              opportunities to investigate several critical two-dimensional                  
              physical phenomena without the complicating effects of a substrate.
