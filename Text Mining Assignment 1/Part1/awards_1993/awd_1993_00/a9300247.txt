Abstract    :
                   The Molecular Physics Laboratory (MPL) at SRI                             
              International will become a site for the National Science                      
              Foundation's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)                      
              program.  The REU program provides talented undergraduates in                  
              science, mathematics, and engineering the opportunity to                       
              participate in active research projects during the summer.                     
              The MPL has developed a world-wide reputation for its                          
              fundamental and applied research in collisional and radiative                  
              processes involving ions, atoms, and small molecules.  This                    
              REU Site Award will permit significant expansion and                           
              unification of SRI's efforts to contribute to the advancement                  
              of undergraduate education in science.  SRI is particularly                    
              interested in providing a research experience for women,                       
              minorities, and persons with disabilities and will make strong                 
              efforts to recruit members of those groups.
