Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Wight of the University of Utah                  
              will measure the rates of solid-state chain reactions in low                   
              temperature matrices in real time using FTIR spectroscopy.                     
              Chlorine atom-hydrocarbon chain reactions involving ethylene or                
              methylcyclopropane will be initiated by laser photolysis and                   
              monitored as a function of temperature and relative                            
              concentration of reagents.  These reactions are initiated by                   
              ultraviolet laser photolysis of thin solid films formed by                     
              vapor deposition of the reagents at cryogenic temperatures                     
              (10-100 K).

              Kinetic studies of chain reactions in condensed, disordered                    
              environments are in their infancy.  The experiments conducted                  
              in this program will lead to a deeper understanding of reactive                
              processes of free radicals in environments that severely                       
              restrict rotational and translational diffusion and will impact                
              a wide variety of technologies, including synthesis of polymers                
              and advanced composite materials.
