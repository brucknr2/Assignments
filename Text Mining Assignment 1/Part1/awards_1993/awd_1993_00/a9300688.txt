Abstract    :
                   This instrumentation will be used to support the polymer                  
              synthesis effort in the Polymers Program at Penn State University.             
              The principal need is for GPC/light scattering equipment which                 
              allows a complete characterization of the molecular weight                     
              distribution of homopolymers and copolymers.  Furthermore, this                
              instrumentation also provides fundamental information concerning               
              the molecular architecture of polymers.                                        
                   It is proposed to use the instrumentation as a central                    
              facility for the department and several groups will utilize it in              
              their research.  Amongst the projects that will be supported by                
              this equipment are;                                                            
              a)   The synthesis of novel polymer materials using boron chemistry            
              b)   the synthesis of cleavable linear, star, ring and cross-linked            
              homopolymers and copolymers using anionic chemistry                            
              c)   the synthesis of homopolymers and copolymers containing                   
              strongly interacting functional groups.
