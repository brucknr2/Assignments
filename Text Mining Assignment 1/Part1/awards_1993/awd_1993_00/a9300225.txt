Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Botany at the                   
              National Museum of Natural History to help support 48                          
              undergraduate students over a three year period who will                       
              participate in both a formal curriculum and closely                            
              supervised independent research in areas such as                               
              systematics, botany, zoology, and paleobiology.  Research                      
              and training in organismal biology, systematic, and ecology                    
              has declined at most universities over the last decade, even                   
              though these fields are critical for evaluating and                            
              addressing loss of biodiversity and global change.  Museums                    
              still carry out basic research in these fields, but have had                   
              little to do with undergraduate education.  The National                       
              Museum of Natural History (NMNH) Research Training Program                     
              at the Smithsonian Institution is designed to stimulate                        
              undergraduates to pursue careers in the natural sciences                       
              through a balanced program of hands-on research, scientific                    
              lectures, and group discussions.  The 10-week long summer                      
              program emphasizes an independent research project                             
              supervised by a member of the scientific staff.  The                           
              training value of the project is enhanced by a set of                          
              lectures, discussions, field trips, and laboratory and                         
              collections demonstrations.  The strengths of the NMNH                         
              Research Training Program are the large number of research                     
              staff (over 120 Ph.D.-level scientists and 250 technicians),                   
              the breadth of research projects (e.g. morphological and                       
              molecular systematics, paleobiology, behavior,                                 
              morphometrics, ecology), the size of the collections (more                     
              than 119 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils,                        
              etc.), and the excellent libraries (over 1 million texts and                   
              journals).  The combination of these resources creates an                      
              unparalleled environment for getting undergraduates started                    
              on careers as researchers in the natural sciences.  As of                      
              1992, students who complete the Program now have the                           
              opportunity to apply for a Pew Fellowship in Systematic                        
              Biology at the Smithsonian that will allow them to continue                    
              their research training at the NMNH through the end of their                   
              undergraduate education.
