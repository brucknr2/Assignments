Abstract    :
              The objective of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates                   
              program in Environmental Science and Engineering at Florida                    
              International University is to stimulate and promote interest,                 
              curiosity, creative and critical thinking of undergraduate students            
              in environmental science and engineering during their early ears               
              in the undergraduate program.  This work will involve the students             
              in a comprehensive research program relative to movement and                   
              dispersion of contaminants and treatment of contaminated media to              
              minimize potential damage to the environment.  This research                   
              program will engage students in different areas of research                    
              relative to movement and treatment of contaminants.  The research              
              will be conducted in the following areas: environmental sciences               
              (environmental biology, environmental physics, and environmental               
              chemistry; environmental engineering (environmental modeling and               
              process design); environmental ethics.
