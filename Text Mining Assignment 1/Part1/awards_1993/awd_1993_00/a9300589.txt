Abstract    :
              Dr. Quang Shen and other members of the Chemistry Department of                
              Colgate University are being supported to continue a Research                  
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the               
              period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each            
              summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                     
              Projects range the traditional areas of chemistry-inorganic,                   
              organic, physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature of this                  
              program is that each project will have chemical kinetics as a theme            
              to provide a common thread for communication among students                    
              initially, and a common base of knowledge for further discourse                
              among students and faculty.
