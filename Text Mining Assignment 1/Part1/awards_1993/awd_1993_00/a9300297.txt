              Bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The                      
              program will provide an intensive summer research experience                   
              for ten undergraduate                                                          
              students in microbiology, molecular biology and related                        
              fields.  Extra effort will be made to recruit qualified                        
              students who are women, minority or disabled, and/or who                       
              otherwise have limited research opportunities at their own                     
              institution.  The main goal of the program is to attract and                   
              stimulate motivated students  to pursue careers in research,                   
              while providing them with hands-on experience.  The                            
              Department of Bacteriology has an internationally recognized                   
              research faculty, committed to both undergraduate and                          
              graduate education, who will direct individual laboratory                      
              research projects.  Participating students will work as part                   
              of a dynamic research team  investigating basic problems in                    
              cellular or molecular biology.  Students will become                           
              familiar with the research techniques of microbiology,                         
              biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology  using modern                     
              equipment and facilities in the Department of Bacteriology.                    
              Students will attend professional seminars and make written                    
              and oral presentations of their own research findings  The                     
              Department has an established record of providing research                     
              opportunities for its own undergraduate students and has                       
              successfully managed a summer research program for sixty-one                   
              students since 1988.
