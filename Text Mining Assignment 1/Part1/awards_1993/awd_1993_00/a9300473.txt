Abstract    :
                   This REU site award will support six undergraduate                        
              researchers working under the supervision of faculty advisors                  
              from the University of Texas at San Antonio and Hendrix College.               
              The project is scheduled to run for a period of ten weeks with                 
              emphasis on research in the newly developing field of wavelets                 
              and their applications.  The plans are ambitious in that the                   
              mathematics of wavelets is still in its developmental stage.                   
              However, opportunities for undergraduates to make substantive                  
              contributions and carry the work further along in their                        
              mathematical development is great.  Some training in harmonic                  
              analysis will be necessary and students with computational                     
              backgrounds will be able to visualize the results quickly.                     
              Applications to image processing, computer vision, stochastic                  
              processes, numerical methods and speech synthesis make this                    
              attractive program an excellent example of how mathematics can                 
              provide insight into the research world without the necessity of               
              long periods of passive lecture and study.
