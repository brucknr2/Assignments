Abstract    :
                   This action will continue the support for the REU Site at                 
              Notre Dame University.  Approximately fifteen undergraduates                   
              will spend the summer participating in a broad research                        
              program covering a number of topics in physics.  Participation                 
              by women and minority students will be particularly                            
              encouraged.
