Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this research is to contribute to our                      
              understanding of how precipitation distributions are established               
              over Africa and South America.  The investigation will be conducted            
              by comparisons among climate models of various degrees of                      
              complexity.  Analysis will focus on understanding how the tropical             
              atmospheric dynamics responds to specified land surface conditions             
              and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, and how this response             
              modifies precipitation patterns over land.                                     
                   The focus is on using climate models to illuminate physical               
              mechanisms, not to generate the most realistic simulation possible.            
              Experiments with a general circulation model (GCM) will be used to             
              isolate the effects of SST distributions and land surface                      
              attributes, such as soil wetness, surface albedo and roughness, on             
              the continental precipitation field in the tropics.  A linearized              
              version on the GCM will be used to further diagnose the GCM's                  
              response.  Comparisons with more complex GCM simulations and with              
              observations will be used to relate results to the real climate.               
                   This research is important because it attempts to enhance                 
              knowledge about how land surface properties affect climate.
