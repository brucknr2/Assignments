Abstract    :
              9300675 Liu  One graduate student at Northwestern University will be supported
              to develop adaptive multiple scale methods for the design and rapid prototyping
              of metal forming processes is requested.  Computer simulation methods for metal
              forming processes based on Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite elements,
              adaptive mesh deployment techniques, multiple-scale methods, and hydrodynamic
              lubrication finite elements will be developed.  In particular it is planned to
              emphasize the interaction of the tool and mental work piece by including the
              effects of lubricant flow, pressure gradient, film entraiment, surface
              roughness and sliding.  This will provide a more realistic modeling of contact,
              lubrication, and frictional stresses.  In the research program, these aspects
              will be studied in conjuction with computer simulation of metal forming
              processes.  Simulation results will be compared with available experimental
              data to help validate and improve the theoretical models.
