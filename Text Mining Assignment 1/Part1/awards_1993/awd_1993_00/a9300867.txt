Abstract    :
              9300867  Christie       In this project the P.I.s will dive at Seamount 6 (near
              EPR  at 12N) to make field measurements and sample hyaloclastite  deposits. 
              Their objective is to evaluate dynamics of  hyaloclastite eruptions.  They
              argue that by studying them they  will obtain constraints on magma ascent
              velocity, plume dynamics  etc, for the high eruption-rate end-member of
              magmatic activity  at ridges.  Once these field observations and other
              measurements  are made, they will employ modelling studies with the help of 
              laboratory experiments.  ***
