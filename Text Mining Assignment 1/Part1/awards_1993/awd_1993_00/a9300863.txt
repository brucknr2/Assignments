Abstract    :
                   The goal of the project is to carry out some high                         
              precision calculations on three and four electron atoms.  The                  
              specific objectives are to  1) resolve a disagreement between                  
              theory and experiment on the 2s-2p transition in Li,  2) to                    
              compute the energy of the Be atom to 1 Hartree or better,  3)                 
              to get a precision lower bound on the non-relativistic energy                  
              of Li and  4) to determine the specific mass shifts and                        
              isotope shifts for several states of Li and Be.
