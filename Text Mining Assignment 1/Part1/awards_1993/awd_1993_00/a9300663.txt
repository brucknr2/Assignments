                  In 1993 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will operate the             
              research vessels ATLANTIS II, KNORR and OCEANUS in support of NSF-             
              funded scientific research.                                                    
                                                                                             
                   KNORR will finish the WOCE work began in 1992 i                           
              n the southern Pacific and then depart for the Atlantic for ONR                
              supported cruises.  NSF supported Marine Geology and Geophysics                
              will be done from the KNORR in the later part of the year.                     
                                                                                             
                   OCEANUS will support NSF-funded biological and physical                   
              oceanography in the Atlantic.  Late in the year OCEANUS will begin             
              a mid-life refit.                                                              
                                                                                             
                   ATLANTIS II provides support for the Deep Submergence Vehicle             
              ALVIN, all 1993 cruises are in support of the submersible.  NSF-               
              supported cruises will be in both the Atlantic and Pacific for                 
              biological and chemical oceanography and marine geology and                    
              geophysics.//
