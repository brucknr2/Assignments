Abstract    :
                   This grant will support an REU Site at the Santa Fe                       
              Institute, so that SFI can expand its existing program which                   
              provides undergraduates with the opportunity for research in                   
              the field of adaptive computation in particular and complex                    
              adaptive systems in general.  Such studies are particularly                    
              appropriate as an entry point for undergraduates into                          
              research.  The program will be open to students in a broad                     
              range of the physical, biological, and computing sciences.
