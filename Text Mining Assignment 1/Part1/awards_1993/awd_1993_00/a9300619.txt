Abstract    :
              9300619  Tepper       Support for three undergraduate researchers will be
              provided  by this award.  The students will work with the principal 
              investigator on selected questions in applied mathematics taken  from
              industry-related problems.  Typical of these questions are  studies of light
              loss in space telescope metering, modeling  clocks in space and analyzing
              relativistic effects of lights  paths.  Some of the work will involve numerical
              approximations.   Visits to industrial research facilities are also planned.   
                 Research experiences for undergraduates provides first-hand  applications of
              mathematical theory developed during students'  classroom experience.  The work
              often leads to publishable  results which are presented at professional
              meetings.  Students  are also better prepared to make important career choices
              when  they return to the final years of undergraduate study.  ***
