Abstract    :
              The GT-SUPREEM program at Georgia Institute of Technology is                   
              serving as a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site.  GT-                
              SUPREEM is an eight-week summer research program designed to                   
              attract qualified minority students into the field of electrical               
              engineering.  Ten students of a least junior-level undergraduate               
              standing will be recruited annually on a nationwide basis and                  
              paired with both a faculty and a graduate student mentor to                    
              undertake research projects in the Georgia Tech School of                      
              Electrical Engineering.  The students will be housed on campus, and            
              in addition to lodging and a travel allowance, will be provided                
              with a $3,000 stipend.  At the conclusion of the summer, the                   
              students will be expected to prepare both oral and written                     
              summaries of their research projects.  It is anticipated that this             
              experience will encourage these students to become applicants for              
              graduate school in ensuing years.
