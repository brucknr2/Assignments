Abstract    :
                9300691  Minker    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   Two related topics, logic programming and deductive databases are  to
              be studied.  In the former, the semantics of extended  disjunctive logic
              programs with logical negation and negation-by-  default are to be developed. 
              Model theoretic, proof theoretic and  fixpoint semantics are to be devised for
              this class of programs.   Alternative rules for negation-by-default are to be
              considered.   Work in extended disjunctive logic programming is related to 
              commonsense and nonmonotonic reasoning.  It will extend the  expressive power
              of logic programming and will permit users to  naturally combine logical
              negation and negation-by-default in one  theory and to compute in that theory. 
              In deductive databases  topics to be studied are: alternative theories for
              disjunctive  normal and extended deductive databases; the view update problem
              in  disjunctive theories; cooperative answering; and combining multiple 
              databases with priorities among atoms.  Work in deductive databases  will
              permit computation in situations where data is indefinite.   This is important
              for databases containing imprecise information  (e.g., medical).  A formal
              theory of database updates is to be  developed for disjunctive databases. 
              Cooperative answering systems  will provide meaningful answers to user queries
              in databases and  will permit queries to be relaxed when there are no answers
              to the  original query.   ***
