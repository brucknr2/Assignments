Abstract    :
              9300707  Smith  The present research program is for providing laboratory data
              for  atomic and molecular collision processes that occur in the earth's  upper
              atmopshere.  Even though collisions have been studied for  decades, many of
              those needed for atmospheric modeling have not  been investigated.  In those
              instances where laboratory studies  have been performed, the data taken have
              often been those of most  interest to the atomic and molecular physicist,
              rather than those  of greatest use to the atmospheric modeler.  In particular
              there is  a need for accurate total cross section data for atmospheric  species
              in the collision energy range relevant to the atmosphere.   These data are
              required for modeling the atmosphere's response to  precipitation of energetic
              particles in the auroral zones and for  understanding the behavior of the upper
              ionosphere.  This program  directly addresses this need.  Specifically, the
              researchers  propose to continue experiments on electron impact ionization of 
              molecules and collisions of keV-energy O,O+,H,H+,He and He+ with  atomic oxygen
              and atomic hydrogen.  ***
