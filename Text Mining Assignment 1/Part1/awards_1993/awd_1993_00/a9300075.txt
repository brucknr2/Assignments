Abstract    :
              9300075  Tzeng  In a message-passing architecture, in the presence of faults, it
               is desirable to retain as many workable nodes as possible during 
              reconfiguration, achieving maximum reconfiguration. This research  investigates
              the maximum reconfiguration of faulty hypercube,  CCC, and mesh systems, and
              explores challenging communication and  performance related issues in
              incomplete multicomputer systems.  ***
