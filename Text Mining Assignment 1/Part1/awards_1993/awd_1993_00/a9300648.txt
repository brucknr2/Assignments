Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project principal investigators will carry out sampling for            
              the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic line                
              along 135 degrees W from 30 degrees S to 60 degrees S and then                 
              eastward to the coast of South America.  This constitutes Pacific              
              WOCE hydrographic line "P-17S."  In addition, the PIs will                     
              collaborate with other Scripps PIs to complete other WOCE lines,               
              "P-19S," along 88 degrees W, and "P-16S," along 150 degrees W.
