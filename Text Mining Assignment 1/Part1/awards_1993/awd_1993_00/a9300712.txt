Abstract    :
                   Collingwood will investigate the relationship between the                 
              singularity theory of Harish-Chandra modules and the matrix                    
              coefficient asymptotics of Harish-Chandra modules.  He will also               
              study several problems related to qualitative features such as                 
              the weight filtration of any degenerate series or generalized                  
              principal series representation.  This builds upon recent work of              
              Collingwood which carries over the highest weight module work of               
              Enright and Shelton to a more general Harish-Chandra module                    
              setting.                                                                       
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
