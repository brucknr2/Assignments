Abstract    :
                   This project will bring seven students per year to the                    
              Computer Science Engineering Department's Architecture and Parallel            
              Processing Laboratory at the University of Texas at Arlington.  The            
              focus of recruiting will be on upper division women, minority, and             
              disabled students, with special emphasis on institutions in the                
              Dallas/Fort Worth area that lack research facilities.  The program             
              will extend over a three year period.  The students will                       
              investigate problems related to parallel program development,                  
              debugging, scheduling, and performance profiling.
