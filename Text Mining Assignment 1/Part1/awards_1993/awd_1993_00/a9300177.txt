Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides funds to the sociology department at University            
              of Missouri-Kansas City for an REU Site which offers students a                
              research experience in sociology during the summer.  Students will             
              be drawn primarily from junior colleges, regional colleges that                
              attract large numbers of minority students from the Kansas City                
              area, and from several small undergraduate colleges in the region              
              that have limited research opportunities for their students.  The              
              program will provide research opportunities for nine students for              
              ten weeks during the summer of 1993.                                           
                                                                                             
              The program has two educational components: (1) The structured                 
              component consists of daily instructional sessions, weekly                     
              colloquia, keeping a research journal (log), and one outside                   
              invited researcher colloquia; (2) The individualized component                 
              consists of four research groups composed of 2-3 students and one              
              faculty member working on a common research project.  The emphasis             
              of the research is on problem selection, approaches to literature              
              review, uses of secondary data sources, when appropriate, to                   
              address research problems, processing and analyzing secondary data,            
              collecting primary data when appropriate, and organizing and                   
              writing up findings into publishable/presentation form.  Additional            
              emphases within the program include teaching team work, learning               
              joint problem solving, utilizing time given competing ends, and                
              working within budgetary constraints.  Students will work alongside            
              research faculty during the summer period and learn first-hand the             
              ways in which the research enterprise is conducted.                            
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to               
              attract talented students into careers in science through active               
              undergraduate research experiences.
