Abstract    :
                   This REU site award at Lafayette College brings together six              
              student researchers for work under faculty supervision in five                 
              possible areas of mathematics.  The work involves investigation                
              of problems from applied operations research leading to traffic                
              flow applications, boundary crossings in the strong law of large               
              numbers, an area of probability theory, and polynomial invariants              
              of graphs. In addition, work on short periods of the convergents               
              of continued fraction moduluo m in number theory and the study of              
              k-terminal networks arising from reliability problems in network               
              theory will be considered.                                                     
                   Outside speakers will be interspersed with faculty and                    
              student presentations during the two-month activity. The students              
              will work in groups of three, but each will be responsible for                 
              producing independent research.  Write-ups of the work at the end              
              of the project is required.
