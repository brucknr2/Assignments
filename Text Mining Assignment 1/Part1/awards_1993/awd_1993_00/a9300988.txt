Abstract    :
              9300988  Drake  The goal of this research is to develop a model of turbulent 
              flucutations and transport in the magnetopause current layer which  can be
              coupled with simulations of collisionless reconnection and  compared with
              observations.  Magnetopause processes are important  because the magnetopause
              is the boundary between the shocked solar  wind plasma in the magnetosheath and
              magnetospheric plasma.   Magnetic reconnection and anomalous transport at the
              magnetopause  are key mechanisms for the transport of solar wind plasma into
              the  magnetosphere.  This effort is a continuation of a study in which  a
              kinetic treatment of the electrostatic limit of the instability  was completed
              and 3-D nonlinear fluid simulations were carried out.   In this continuing
              study, more simulations will be performed and  the deduced electric and
              magnetic field fluctuation spectra will be  compared with spacecraft
              observations.  ***
