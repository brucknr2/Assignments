Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It will support a study of the                 
              coping process of African-American and Asian-American parents whose            
              children are juvenile delinquents, employing family stress theory.             
              Interviews with 40 families in each ethnic group will compare                  
              perceptions and coping behaviors, applying a theoretical model that            
              considers ethnicity to shape definitions of stressful events and               
              the selection of strategies for dealing with them.                             
                                                                                             
                   This study will contribute to scientific understanding of                 
              juvenile delinquency and of socio-cultural differences between                 
              American ethnic groups, thus building the knowledge base for public            
              policy on this social problem.  In addition to the scientific gains            
              to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist              
              a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.                
              dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific                    
              manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next                   
              generation of sociologists.
