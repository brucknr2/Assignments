Abstract    :
              9300042  Francis  This project consists of a series of real time interactive
              computer animation  programs for mathematical visualization on workstations. 
              This software will be available to the networked scientific community by
              anonymous ftp from a server located at the National Center for Supercomputing
              Applications. These short (500-1500 line) programs will be written in simple C
              and use the generic graphics primitives in the Iris gl-library.  They will be
              exemplary codes, intended to help research mathematicians to write their own
              code solving similar visualization problems.  These programs will treat topics
              of current interest to mathematicians and mathematically trained scientists. 
              This software will be supported by manual pages, tutorials and an informal
              bulletin board.
