Abstract    :
              The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University is              
              enhancing its established undergraduate research program with a                
              summer component.  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates                 
              program will involve students from Clemson and other institutions              
              in a ten week program of research, seminars, and workshops.  All               
              of the activities will challenge the participants intellectually               
              and develop their critical thinking skills as well as their ability            
              to work independently.  The one-on-one contact with faculty and                
              interaction with graduate students will also introduce these                   
              students to the opportunities in graduate education and the career             
              options in research and academia..  Fifty percent of the faculty               
              have participated in undergraduate research projects spanning the              
              areas of thermal and fluid science, mechanical and manufacturing               
              systems, engineering mechanics, and materials.
