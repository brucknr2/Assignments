Abstract    :
                   This action will support the continuation of an REU Site at               
              the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.  Approximately twenty                    
              students, mostly from other colleges, will spend a ten-week                    
              research apprenticeship.  Recruitment for the program will be                  
              through SPS chapters nationally, with special attention to                     
              recruiting from historically black institutions and small                      
              colleges which lack the large number of research opportunities                 
              available at the University of Michigan.  In addition to their                 
              research experience, students will have the opportunity to take a              
              course in shop technique and mini course in practical electronics              
              skills.  Opportunities to explore research areas other than their              
              primary placement will be provided.
