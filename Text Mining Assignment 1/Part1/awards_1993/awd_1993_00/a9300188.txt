Abstract    :
              This is a study of the heterogeneous oxidation of alkenes on                   
              metal surfaces, specifically on surfaces of silver, platinum,                  
              and palladium.  A variety of ultrahigh-vacuum methods are used,                
              including temperature-programmed reaction techniques,                          
              vibrational spectroscopy, and photoelectron spectroscopy;                      
              synchrotron radiation techniques are used in selected cases to                 
              determine adsorbate geometries.  Reaction intermediates are                    
              identified and isolated if possible, and rate constants for the                
              elementary reaction steps are determined.  Both selective                      
              oxidation and combustion processes are studied.                                
                                                                                             
              Although this is a fundamental study not directed at any                       
              specific applications, the systems under investigation are used                
              in a number of important industrial processes as well as in                    
              pollution control systems, including automotive catalytic                      
              converters.  The new information generated here could influence                
              the design of such systems.
