Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed study is to critically examine and               
              analyze architectural, foundation, and structural damage to ancient            
              historic monuments and related ground failure in Cairo, Egypt,                 
              caused by the moderate earthquake in northern Egypt that occurred              
              on October 12, 1992. This examination and the subsequent report is             
              expected to benefit not only the engineering design and evaluation             
              of structures, but also the ongoing NSF study, "Preserving Historic            
              Buildings of Major Importance."***//
