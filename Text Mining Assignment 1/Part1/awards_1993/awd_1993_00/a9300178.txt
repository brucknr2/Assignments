Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              When and how often are congressional statutes reviewed and decided             
              in court?  Although the U.S. judiciary was designed to exercise no             
              policymaking role, numerous cas studies and historical analyses                
              make clear that at least since the 1960s and 1970s, the courts have            
              been intervening with significant impact in both social policies               
              and regulatory issues.  Because so little systematic research has              
              been done in this critically important area, this doctoral                     
              dissertation research project promises to enhance our understanding            
              of the topic.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              A number of competing arguments as to why congressional statutes               
              land in the courts for review have been offered up.  The failure of            
              Congress to sufficiently define, specify, clarify, and resolve                 
              potential issues of conflict and dispute in public laws for                    
              implementation purposes will be the particular focus of this                   
              research.  Other arguments will be assessed as well, including                 
              issue complexity, implementation failure, interest group                       
              opportunism, public litigiousness, and judicial activism.                      
                                                                                             
              Using quantitative methods, including maximum likelihood                       
              techniques, this study reviews the statutes produced by Congress in            
              the post-World War II era and traces subsequent court action on                
              those same statutes.  Specifically, focusing on a randomly selected            
              sample of statutes signed into law from 1949 to the mid-1980s, this            
              project will 1) examine the nature of the statutes themselves; 2)              
              track how many of these statutes are challenged in which courts; 3)            
              identify what factors appear to determine whether or not and to                
              what extent any particular statute is subject to court review; and,            
              4) analyze change in the nature of statutes and in the factors that            
              appear to have pushed some statutes into the courts for review                 
              across the thirty six year period under investigation.
