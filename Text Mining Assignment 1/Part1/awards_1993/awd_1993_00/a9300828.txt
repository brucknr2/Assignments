Abstract    :
              Description: The proposed research project is                                  
              in the earth sciences and its objective is to                                  
              develop knowledge that will lead to improved                                   
              analysis of geological materials and realistic                                 
              constitutive models for systems that will be                                   
              used in river valley projects. Realistic                                       
              constitutive models will allow incorporation of                                
              many factors such as nonlinear material                                        
              behavior, insitu stresses, and discontinuities                                 
              very often ignored or highly simplified in the                                 
              past.  Together with modern computational                                      
              methods the resulting procedures will permit                                   
              solutions of highly complex problems which are                                 
              difficult to solve using conventional methods.                                 
              A unique aspect of the research is the                                         
              integration of basic mathematical modelling for                                
              realistic characterization of the behavior of                                  
              materials, implementation of models in non-                                    
              linear computational procedures, and                                           
              verification of field behavior of typical                                      
              structures.  The collaboration is between

              Scope:  Results of the research will benefit                                   
              applications of advanced constitutive models                                   
              and computer procedures for the development of                                 
              rational structures for river valley projects                                  
              both in India and the U.S.  This type of                                       
              research is particularly relevant in the U.S.                                  
              as significant research work is in progress in                                 
              constitutive modelling of geologic materials                                   
              and discontinuities, development of new                                        
              laboratory devices, implementation of                                          
              constitutive models in computer methods and                                    
              verification through laboratory/field studies.                                 
              A formal collaboration will be of mutual                                       
              benefit.
