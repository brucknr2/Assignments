Abstract    :
              9300389  Wan       This award supports the research of Professor Wan to work in 
              number theory.  A basic question in number theory is to determine  the p-adic
              values of the zeros and poles of zeta functions over  finite fields.  Professor
              Wan proposes to give a systematic  investigation of this question for families
              of zeta functions and  L-functions.  One method is to use Dwork's p-adic
              theory.  A new  key ingredient is the introduction of some maximizing functions
               from linear programming.  Professor Wan expects to resolve the 
              Adolphson-Sperber conjecture about the generic Newton polygon of L-  functions
              of exponential sums and prove a strong version of the  Dwork-Mazur conjecture
              about the generic Newton polygon of zeta  functions of hypersurfaces.       
              This is research in the field of number theory.   Number  theory starts with
              the whole numbers and questions such as the  divisibility of one whole number
              by another.  It is among the  oldest fields of mathematics and it was
              originally pursued for  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last
              half century,  it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for
               computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.   ***
