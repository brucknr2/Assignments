Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Division of Biology and                       
              Biomedical Sciences at Washington University to continue a                     
              successful REU Site.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Each summer, about 36 undergraduates from diverse collegiate                   
              and ethnic backgrounds will spend 10 weeks engaged in                          
              developmental biology research at the University.  Mentors                     
              will be selected by the students from about 40 faculty                         
              members who have active, well-funded research groups and who                   
              study developmental mechanisms in a wide range of                              
              experimental systems.  The emphasis will be on getting each                    
              student actively engaged in increasingly independent                           
              research in one of these productive research groups.                           
              However, to permit students to view their own research in a                    
              broader context, the program will provide five types of                        
              supplemental activities:  (i) workshops dealing with                           
              important model organisms, methods and paradigms in                            
              contemporary developmental biology research, (ii) faculty                      
              seminars designed specifically for the students, (iii)                         
              participation in the existing Developmental Biology Journal                    
              Club, (iv) a parallel journal club run by and for the                          
              students themselves and (v) an end-of-summer research                          
              retreat at which all students will present papers                              
              summarizing their research accomplishments.  Opportunities                     
              for frequent peer-group social interactions will also be                       
              provided.
