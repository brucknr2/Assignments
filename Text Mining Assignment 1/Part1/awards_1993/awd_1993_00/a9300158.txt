Abstract    :
              9300158  Wilson       The award is for a theoretical and experimental research 
              program on chatter in the rolling of flat products.  Theoretical  research will
              include the development of dynamic models of mill  structures, and of the
              rolling process with a realistic  characterization of friction, and the
              coupling of these models to  create a model for chatter.  This will treat
              chatter due to  negative process damping, mode-coupling, regeneration, and
              other  composite mechanisms in single and multi-stand mills.  Experiments  on
              rolling dynamics and chatter using a laboratory-scale mill in  combination with
              data measured on the industrial participants'  mills will assist the
              development and validation of the theoretical  models.       The research is
              expected to result in better methods for mill  and process design, and to lay
              the groundwork for more intelligent  mill control systems.
