Abstract    :
              9300095  Eyler  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
              will  assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida in  the
              purchase of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance Mass  Spectrometer. 
              Four faculty members whose research is dependent  upon Fourier transform mass
              spectroscopy will greatly  benefit from  the acquisition of this instrument. 
              Research projects to be  carried out with this instrument include: 1)
              Resolution of glow  discharge polyatomic interferences, 2) Electrospray FT-mass
               spectral studies of mono-nuclear and polynuclear metal complex  ions, 3)
              Spectroscopic and thermodynamic studies of gas-phase  photoactive metal
              complexes, 4) Reactions of metal and  semiconductor clusters and
              photodissociation spectroscopy, 5) Laser  formation and photodissociation of
              ions, 6) Formation and  bimolecular reactivity of pyridinium ions.  %%%  A
              Fourier transform mass spectrometer is capable of extremely high 
              mass-resolution and is used to measure the precise molecular weight  of a
              molecular ion.  It may also be used to obtain highly detailed  information
              about ion molecule reactions in the gas phase.  This  information may be used
              to help determine the atomic composition  and, sometimes, the molecular
              geometry of a molecule.  ***
