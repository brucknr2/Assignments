Abstract    :
              9300710  Hoch    This award provides partial support for a conference 
              "Nanofabrication and Biosystems: Frontiers and Challenges" to be  held on
              January 16-21, 1994 in Hawaii.  The conference is  designed to address the
              current status and future possibilities  of nano- and microfabrication
              technologies and biology.  Scientists from such disparate disciplines as
              material science  and engineering, and various subdisciplines of biological 
              sciences will participate.    The objective of the conference is to explore
              contemporary and  emerging approaches of nano- and microfabrication as they
              apply  to biology.  The intent of the conference is to bring together 
              engineers/physical scientists and biologists including  biophysicists, cell
              biologists, neuroscientists, and plant  biologists.  The conference will
              address the materials science  and engineering aspects of nano- and
              microfabrication, how  biologists have implemented such fabricated devices in
              their  research endeavors, and where the opportunities are for fruitful 
              collaboration between biologists and engineers.  An important  aspect of this
              objective will be to inform young scientists.  The  proceedings of the
              conference will be published by the  Engineering Foundation.    European and
              Japanese scientists will participate in this  conference, making it an
              international meeting.  ***
