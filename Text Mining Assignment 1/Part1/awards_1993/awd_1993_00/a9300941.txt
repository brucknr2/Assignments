Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Burrow and Jordan (at the                           
              Universities of Nebraska and Pittsburgh, respectively) will                    
              continue joint experimental and theoretical studies of                         
              low-energy electron scattering from a number of hydrocarbons.                  
              Experimental studies at both institutions will examine                         
              vibrational excitation and angular distributions                               
              using photoelectron spectroscopy to locate temporary anion                     
              states (resonances).  Jordan will calculate the location of                    
              resonances at Pittsburgh, first using ethylene and propene as                  
              model systems, and then applying those results to methyl and                   
              ethyl chloride.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              A powerful means of visualizing molecular structure and                        
              chemical reactivity is provided by the concept of occupied and                 
              unoccupied electron states, which are also known as orbitals.                  
              Photoelectron spectroscopy has long provided a means of                        
              studying occupied orbitals, but until recently the                             
              corresponding data for normally unoccupied orbitals has been                   
              scarce.  This work aims at gathering such data, thereby helping                
              to answer key chemical questions on structure and bonding in                   
              complex molecules.  It also offers data crucial to models of                   
              electron transfer, which is the mechanism involved in a large                  
              number of chemical processes such as photosynthesis.
