Abstract    :
                   MacCluer will continue her research on several problems                   
              which lie at the interface of operator theory and function                     
              theory, involving composition operators on analytic function                   
              spaces.  Identification of the spectrum of a composition operator              
              acting on a Hilbert space of analytic functions on the unit ball               
              in C^n will be of particular concern.  Ross will study the                     
              invariant subspaces of Bergman spaces on certain slit domains and              
              investigate the relationship between the geometry of the slit and              
              the behavior of the functions near the slit.                                   
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
