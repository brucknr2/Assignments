Abstract    :
                   The eastern U.S. is a major source of ozone and ozone  precursors to the
              North Atlantic region.  Previous studies have  shown that emissions from this
              region significantly affect levels  of NOx and hydrocarbons over the Western
              North Atlantic Ocean, and  recent measurements indicate that transport of ozone
              produced over  the eastern U.S substantially alters the ozone budget of the 
              temperate North Atlantic region.  However the total impact of  anthropogenic
              emissions on the photochemistry of this region is  currently poorly understood.
               A primary reason is a paucity of  information on NOx (NO + NO2) and total
              reactive nitrogen levels  over the central and eastern North Atlantic, which
              results in  uncertainty as to the ultimate fate and impact of anthropogenic 
              emissions on the regional ozone budget.       This project seeks to address
              this problem through  measurements of NO and NOy (total reactive nitrogen
              oxides) at a  site in the Azores.  The location is ideal for observation of
              aged  emissions transported from eastern North America and is suitably 
              isolated from European impacts.  Measurements would be made in  conjunction
              with a currently-planned CO (carbon) and O3 (ozone)  monitoring program, and
              would take place in concert with the other  measurement programs in order to
              assess seasonal variations.  The  resulting data would be used to quantify
              anthropogenic impacts on  NOx and ozone levels in the North Atlantic
              troposphere.
