Abstract    :
                   Salmon and trout will be used as model system for developing              
              nuclear DNA markers for problems in conservation genetics.                     
              Inheritance experiments will provide a needed test of the utility              
              of nuclear DNA makers for conservation genetic studies.  Recent                
              results have raised an important challenge to the use of allozymes             
              to describe genetic population structure.  The generality of the               
              result that nuclear DNA and allozyme markers do not provide a                  
              concordant view of the distribution of genetic                                 
              variation among populations within a species will be tested.

              Salmon and trout of western North America offer one of the                     
              greatest challenges to the application salmon and trout is less                
              than 5% of historic numbers within the Columbia River system, and              
              several local populations have been listed under the Endangered                
              Species Act within the last three years.  These studies will                   
              provide a genetic basis for the conservation of these valuable                 
              fishes.
