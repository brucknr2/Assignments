Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In 1993 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will operate the             
              Deep Submergence Vessel ALVIN. the submersible is certified for                
              depth of 4,000M and is designated a national asset.  The ALVIN is              
              supported by the research vessel ATLANTIS II (AII). Both vehicles              
              have been operated effectively and safely by the institute for a               
              wide variety of NSF-Sponsored research projects.  Through a                    
              Memorandum of Agreement the submersible is operated in support of              
              projects funded by NSF, ONR or NOAA and is funded accordingly by               
              these agencies. The ALVIN is currently scheduled for a total of 258            
              operational days during 1993, of which 165 are in support of NSF-              
              sponsored programs. NSF-supported cruises will take place in both              
              the Atlantic and Pacific for biological, chemical and marine                   
              geological and geophysical research.
