Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Lindner to                  
              work in combinatorics.  The objective of this proposal is basic                
              research in graph designs and related combinatorial structures.                
              In particular, the investigator intends to place emphasis on                   
              problems dealing with small embeddings for a pair of orthogonal                
              latin squares and continued generalizations on embeddings latin                
              squares and rectangles.                                                        
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
