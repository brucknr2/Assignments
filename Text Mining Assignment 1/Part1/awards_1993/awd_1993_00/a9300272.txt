Abstract    :
              The Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at Penn State              
              provides opportunities for Mechanical Engineering students to                  
              participate in research related to real problems involved in                   
              manufacturing systems, control systems, thermal systems and fluid              
              mechanics.  The research projects proposed assume completion of the            
              junior year in a standard mechanical engineering curriculum and                
              build upon the students' education in one or more of the following             
              courses: dynamics, kinematics, controls, fluid mechanics and heat              
              transfer.  Students selected to participate in the program are                 
              offered the opportunity to visit the campus prior to the start of              
              the summer experience.  During the visit, they meet with the PIs               
              and the research advisors.  Matching of the students and advisors              
              is thus accomplished prior to the start of the research experience.            
              The research experience is on a one-on-one basis with the advisor;             
              however, group opportunities to exchange ideas between the REU                 
              participants and faculty are organized throughout the summer.                  
              Formal presentation of the research takes place during the final               
              week.
