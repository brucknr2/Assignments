Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the preparation of silaallenes,                  
              silynes, borasilenes and diborenes.  Attempts will be made to                  
              prepare fullerenes containing one or more silicon atoms in the                 
              cage and to construct polymers containing fullerene clusters                   
              linked by siloxane or polysilane moieties.

              With this renewal award the Synthetic Organic Program is                       
              supporting the research of Dr. Robert West of the Department of                
              Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  Professor                  
              West will focus his work on the synthesis of multiply-bonded                   
              silicon and boron compounds, the preparation of silicon                        
              derivatives of the fullerenes and polymers containing fullerene                
              clusters.
