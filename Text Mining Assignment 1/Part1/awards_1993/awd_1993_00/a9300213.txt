Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will be at the            
              Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at Penn State during 1993-              
              1994.  The REU site will involve at least nine, and possibly twelve            
              or more, students in research projects each summer, six funded by              
              the National Science Foundation (NSF), three or more from other                
              research sources within the department.  Students will be involved             
              in a wide range of frontier research projects in ground- and                   
              space-based observations and theory, and instrumentation.                      
                                                                                             
              As a REU site, the Department will engage in an aggressive                     
              recruiting program for students in a large geographical area                   
              covering Pennsylvania, the surrounding mid-Atlantic states and                 
              Appalachia, and southeastern states, including large rural areas               
              for which Penn State is one of the nearest major research                      
              institutions.  Minority participation will be encouraged through               
              the use of contacts with predominantly minority universities and               
              colleges in the region.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Seminars and special tutorials will broaden students' knowledge of             
              astronomy and astrophysics, ensure interaction with faculty, and               
              teach valuable skills including laboratory, observational and data             
              analysis.  Extra-curricular activities will encourage informal                 
              interaction with faculty and graduate students.  The program will              
              focus on encouraging students' interest in careers in astronomy and            
              astrophysics.
