Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) requests funding             
              to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded                 
              research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V PELICAN, a              
              105 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the University.                
              The PI requests funding to purchase a Seacat Profiler and                      
              autoanalyzer upgrades.  The instrumentation requested will be used             
              aboard the R/V PELICAN in support of 59 days of NSF-funded                     
              scientific research in 1993.
