Abstract    :
                   This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate                
              researchers working under the supervision of several faculty                   
              advisors on projects in diverse areas of number theory, topology               
              an mathematical models of population dynamics.  They will work                 
              both individually and in small groups.  The site continues                     
              similar activities ranging back to the beginning of the REU                    
              program.  The record of student accomplishments and science                    
              career choices has been excellent.                                             
                   Students will be expected to prepare seminar talks and their              
              work and submit final reports at the end of the summer.  Those                 
              whose progress has been particularly successful will be                        
              encouraged to present their work at appropriate professional                   
              meetings.  In addition, it has been the tradition at this site to              
              invite a distinguished guest mathematician to spend a week or                  
              more with the students.  Past guests include Serge Lang, Harold                
              Stark and Edwin Spanier.
