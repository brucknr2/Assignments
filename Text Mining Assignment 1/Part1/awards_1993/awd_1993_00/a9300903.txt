Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Microbiology Department of                    
              the University of Texas at Austin to continue their                            
              successful REU Site program designed to introduce gifted                       
              undergraduates to productive molecular biology laboratory                      
              research. A ten-week summer program, involving ten students                    
              each year, will provide to each participant a stipend, room                    
              & board and tuition for an independent research course.                        
              Participants will be actively recruited nationwide, but                        
              emphasis in recruitment and selection will be given to                         
              undergraduates who would not otherwise have the opportunity                    
              for original research, especially minority students.                           
              Students will work in well-funded and equipped labs in which                   
              the research covers both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems                    
              and deals with membrane transport, DNA replication and                         
              recombination, gene expression and developmental control,                      
              immunological mechanisms, and viral transformation.                            
              Participants will work individually with faculty mentors but                   
              have access to all faculty through seminars and informal                       
              discussions, in a format similar to that of our successful                     
              earlier programs. New aspects in this year's program                           
              include discussion of scientific ethics issues and emphasis                    
              on opportunities in biotechnology. Follow-up activities will                   
              promote interest in research careers and encourage students                    
              to apply to graduate schools in molecular biology. UT Austin                   
              makes a strong commitment to this program, including support                   
              for a dedicated program coordinator.
