Abstract    :
              9300866  Newell  This is a project to study the coupling of the solar wind to 
              the magnetosphere and ionosphere.  The study relies on  particle and driftmeter
              data from the DMSP satellite and  includes collaborative efforts with
              ground-based  instrumentation.  The distribution of electrical potential 
              across the low latitude boundary layer will be determined, as  well as the
              local time dependence of the cross polar cap  potential.  This project
              continues the vigorous program of  national and international collaborations
              which have been so  successful in studying these complex coupling processes.
