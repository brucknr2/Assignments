Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to establish a Research Experience                   
              for Undergraduates SITE at the Center for the Study of                         
              Early Events in Photosynthesis at Arizona State University.                    
              Life on this planet is ultimately dependent on                                 
              photosynthesis for its energy requirements.  The Center,                       
              comprised of faculty in the departments of Botany and                          
              Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an interdisciplinary                         
              approach to understanding the energy storage process carried                   
              out by photosynthetic organisms and mimicking photosynthesis                   
              using artificial systems.  Undergraduate students will                         
              participate in the individual research programs of the                         
              Center faculty. Projects will include organic synthesis and                    
              spectroscopic studies of photosynthetic model compounds,                       
              spectroscopic studies of bacterial and plant photosynthetic                    
              reaction centers, biochemical and molecular characterization                   
              of mutant reaction centers, and molecular biology and                          
              genetics of photosynthetic systems.  Structured interaction                    
              between faculty and student participants, including the                        
              weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research group                           
              meetings, instrumentation workshops and a concluding                           
              undergraduate symposium, will help educate the students in                     
              the extremely diverse modern approach to the study of                          
              photosynthesis. Student participants will be recruited from                    
              targeted colleges and universities in the Southwest United                     
              States with the help of local department chairs and                            
              individual faculty.
