Abstract    :
              9300832  Onsager  The goal of this research is to develop a quantitative, 3-D
              model  of electron and ion distribution functions in the open magnetic  field
              regions of the magnetosphere.  This research will contain two  main components:
              1) a comparison of the model results with  spacecraft data, and 2) the
              extension of our current model to three  spatial dimensions using more
              realistic electric fields.  By  comparing the model with data, we will evaluate
              its predictive  capabilities and identify additional physical processes that
              could  be added.  This GEM model will be ideally suited for detailed 
              comparisons of multiple spacecraft data, as will be obtained later  this decade
              with the launch of FREJA, WIND, POLAR, FAST, CLUSTER,  etc.  The model will
              also be designed to interface with 3-D global  models.  These global models
              will provide magnetic and electric  fields used for our particle mapping in the
              magnetosphere, while  the distribution functions obtained from our model will
              augment the  global modelling results.  Our mode will provide an important link
               between the detailed particle measurements made by spacecraft and  the global
              magnetospheric/solar wind properties.  As such, it will  serve as an important
              component of the Geospace Global Circulation  Model envisioned by the GEM
              research community.  ***
