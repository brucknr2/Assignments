Abstract    :
                   This project seeks to develop comprehensive dynamic and                   
              thermal models for high speed spindle systems.  The study addresses            
              the dynamic characteristics of high speed spindle-bearing systems              
              during operation, including the effects of bearing initial set-up              
              and geometry, initial preloads, thermal load, external cutting                 
              force, rotational speed, and bearing spacing, and attempts to                  
              develop models to predict dynamic compliance and thermal stability.            
              In addition, advanced bearing designs and materials will be tested             
              and analyzed, and their performance will be evaluated in comparison            
              with conventional bearings.  As a final outcome of the project, a              
              computer aided analysis system for high speed spindles will be                 
              developed.  This analysis package will provide prediction of                   
              spindle-bearing dynamic characteristics, bearing contact loads and             
              temperature rise, which can lead to optimal design and operation               
              of high speed spindles.                                                        
                   Successful analysis and design of high speed spindles will                
              enable easier implementation of high speed machining.  Spindle                 
              failure is currently a significant problem in high speed machining             
              practice.
