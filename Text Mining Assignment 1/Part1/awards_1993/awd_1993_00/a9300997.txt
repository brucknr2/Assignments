Abstract    :
                   As increasingly much background information becomes                       
              available to scientists undertaking an investigation, it is                    
              important to utilize previous knowledge effectively in designing               
              studies and analyzing data.  Bayesian statistical methods are                  
              tailored to this computation, but scientific meetings rarely                   
              spend substantial time discussing applications of Bayesian                     
              statistics.  The goal is to elucidate the interplay between                    
              theory and practice and thereby identify successful methods and                
              indicate important directions for future research.
