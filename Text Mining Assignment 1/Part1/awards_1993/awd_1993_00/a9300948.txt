Abstract    :
              9300948  Friedman       This project is concerned with a number of nonlinear 
              problems in partial differential equations.  These problems  include: (a) free
              boundary problems that arise in studying the  visual development in
              electrophotography, (b) the formation of  electric images in
              electrophotography, (c) free boundary problems  for Navier-Stokes equations,
              (d) coalescence models for  dislocations, (e) diffusion of networks, (f) a
              kinetic model for  photobleaching, and (g) the Stefan problem with kinetic 
              condition.         The research is concerned with nonlinear problems in partial
               differential equations as motivated by physical and engineering  models; many
              of these models come directly from U.S. industry.   The problems involve either
              (1) partial differential equations  and systems, which are nonlinear and
              possibly degenerate as well,  or (ii) linear partial differential equations and
              systems in  domains with a free boundary.  The problems to be considered  arise
              from such areas as semiconductor processing,  electrophotography, and coating
              flows.  ***
