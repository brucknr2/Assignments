Abstract    :
                   An ultra fast scanning tunneling microscope will be                       
              constructed to image atomic motions over small distances in                    
              ultrahigh vacuum.  By optimizing the instrument for imaging of                 
              small areas (less than 100 A across) atomic resolution imaging will            
              be achieved at ratesup to 10 msec per image for full images, or 100            
              usec per scan line for narrow images.  These rates are 10 to 1000              
              times faster than currently available UHV instruments.  The system             
              will operate at sample temperatures up to and above 600 C.  This               
              will permit the observation of dynamical processes on material                 
              surfaces with much faster timescales than is currently possible.               
              Samples will also be characterized by LEED.  In particular, we will            
              use this instrument to study atomic diffusion of Si adatoms during             
              annealing of the Si(100)-2x1 reconstructed surface as an                       
              investigation of the fundamentals of molecular beam epitaxy.  We               
              will also study the motion of surface atoms during melting of the              
              Ge(111)-c(2x8) reconstructed surface.
