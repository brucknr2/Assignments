Abstract    :
              The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the                      
              University of Massachusetts has a Research Experiences for                     
              Undergraduates program in the department's Microwave Remote Sensing            
              Laboratory.  Researchers in this laboratory create research                    
              instrumentation that is used by federal agencies, industry and                 
              other universities to conduct important scientific experiments on              
              the earth's atmosphere, oceans, land and ice surfaces.                         
              Undergraduate students supported under this project will work with             
              a large number of talented pre- and post- doctoral researchers, who            
              design, fabricate, test and use their sophisticated sensors in                 
              geophysical experiments with members of the scientific community.              
              This work will require the students to do highly interdisciplinary             
              work in the laboratory and in the field.
