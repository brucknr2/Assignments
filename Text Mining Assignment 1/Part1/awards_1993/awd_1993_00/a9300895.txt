Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to discuss               
              recent findings and current thinking in various areas of science.              
              Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of            
              established scientists, young investigators who are making                     
              important contributions in these areas and post doctoral fellows.              
              They are usually held in small isolated New England towns away from            
              other distractions and are conducive to the free exchange of ideas.            
              These conferences have a recognized value for presenting the latest            
              advances in research and also indicating the future trends which               
              are likely to be most productive.
