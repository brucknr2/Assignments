Abstract    :
              Kikuchi  9300326       Project MAXWELL aims at bringing together two research
              efforts  under way at the University of Michigan (U-M) and at Carnegie  Mellon
              University (CMU) in the area of discrete part design and  manufacturing.  The
              U-M team has developed a strategy for designing  the form and material
              composition of structures and structural  components based only on a
              description of loading conditions and  packaging requirements.  The CMU team
              has developed a method for  free-form fabrication of parts from single or
              composite materials  by thermal spray shape deposition.  Under project MAXWELL,
               structural parts will be designed (both for form and material  composition),
              fabricated, and tested in an integrated manner.       This project is concerned
              primarily with the design phase of  project MAXWELL.  In particular, the
              previously developed,  mathematically rigorous procedure for the concurrent
              design of  material composition and topology of 2D structures to include 3D 
              components.  This involves two major tasks: (1) extending the 2D  domain of the
              homogenization method to include the realization of  novel mechanical parts
              that possess superior structural and thermo-  mechanical properties, and
              satisfy downstream manufacturing  requirements.  The project address proof of
              concept through design,  manufacture, and testing of actual parts.
