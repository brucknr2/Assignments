Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will enable an                       
              investigation of the referendum to be held in Canada on                        
              October 26, 1992.  This referendum involves a series of                        
              constitutional arrangements intended to maintain the country's                 
              geographic and political integrity.  Of particular importance is               
              the status of Quebec.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The investigators have gained space on a telephone survey to be                
              conducted of a national sample of two thousand Canadian                        
              respondents.  The survey involves a study of institutionalism and              
              political democracy in Canada with particular focus on the                     
              sociopolitical, economic and cultural values of the Canadian                   
              electorate.  The telephone survey will be undertaken with a split-             
              half sample immediately before and immediately after the October               
              26th referendum.  The data obtained from this investigation will be            
              archived for use by other social scientists interested in political            
              behavior and political participation.  The study will provide a                
              unique opportunity to gather data in a timely and cost-effective               
              fashion on this extremely important referendum issue.
