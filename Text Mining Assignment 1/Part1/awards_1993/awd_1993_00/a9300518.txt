Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of the effect of                 
              corporate mergers on social solidarity among the employees of two              
              Silicon Valley organizations.  The investigators will collect both             
              qualitative and quantitative data through interviews and other                 
              means to develop and test a model of solidarity that integrates                
              organizational structure and performance with members' role                    
              sufficiency, sense of belonging, affect, and attachment.                       
                                                                                             
                   The research will develop a multi-dimensional understanding of            
              worker commitment and organizational effectiveness, during times               
              when a small industrial organization is taken over by a larger one,            
              thus contributing both to social psychology and to the sociology of            
              organizations.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved             
              by the research, this award will materially assist a highly                    
              promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.                         
              dissertation.  Thus it contributes to future scientific manpower               
              and the thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
