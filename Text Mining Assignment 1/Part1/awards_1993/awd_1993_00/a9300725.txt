Abstract    :
                   The investigator will conduct research on empirical                       
              processes, U-processes, their bootstrap and some of their                      
              applications in statistics.  The limit theory for degenerate U-                
              processes has not yet reached a satisfactory stage, and the                    
              bootstrap of U-processes, degenerate or not, is far from being                 
              resolved.  The applications include asymptotic theory as well as               
              uniqueness and robustness properties of the empirical simplicial               
              median.  Open questions for U-statistics, such as almost sure                  
              convergence to zero of sums of normalized products of random                   
              variables will also be considered.                                             
                   Modern empirical process theory, developed during the last                
              twenty years and not yet totally completed, not only sheds light               
              on one of the basic questions in Statistics (namely, how well do               
              sample properties approach population properties) but has been                 
              providing a high road to the study of important problems in                    
              asymptotic statistics. U--processes, a non-linear generalization               
              of empirical processes, should play a similar, although more                   
              restricted, role. We propose to continue work on empirical and                 
              U--processes and their bootstraps, and to investigate some                     
              applications, such as to multidimensional robust location                      
              parameters.
