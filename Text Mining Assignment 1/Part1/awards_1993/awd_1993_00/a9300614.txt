Abstract    :
                   The objective of the research is to develop a closed loop                 
              control system for induction plasma deposition in order to  improve            
              manufactured material quality and also expand the                              
              processing capabilities.  Such a system will also provide new                  
              capabilities to examine the structure/performance relations                    
              achievable by plasma deposition.  The research is focused on the               
              following areas: 1) experimental verification of a low order model             
              of the process and its refinement, 2) development of control                   
              structure, control implementation, and preliminary                             
              processing/materials property studies, and 3) extension to related             
              systems.                                                                       
                   Plasma torches are used to melt and accelerate metallic and/or            
              ceramic particles in order to form dense coatings at high                      
              production rates.  Plasma deposition is used in a variety of                   
              different applications including corrosion, thermal and wear                   
              resistance coatings, near net shape manufacture, and production of             
              metal matrix composites.  Successful modeling and control of the               
              process will reduce variations in material quality in induction                
              plasma deposition processes.
