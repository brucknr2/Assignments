Abstract    :
              Hill/Sherry  9300310    This project will examine the use of information
              technology in Native American efforts toward development and increased cultural
              autonomy.  Research will take place primarily on the Navajo Indian Reservation,
              with multiple levels of analysis being pursued.  These levels include: 1)
              identification of the uses to which computers and related artifacts are
              applied; 2) microanalysis of instances of computer use, focusing on the
              relationship between Navajo conversational patterns and the interactive demands
              imposed by computer software; and 3) attention to the economic and political
              environments into which technology is introduced.  Methods will include
              ethnographic observation and interview techniques, as well as the use of video
              and audio recordings (and transcription) to capture and identify patterns of
              behavior and problems of interaction at the micro analytic level.  Results will
              be of interest to studies of Native American relations with the dominant
              culture; culture, science and technology programs; discourse centered
              approaches to culture change; and studies in human-computer interaction and
              inter ethnic communication.  ***     v     & < t 2       T        & |
