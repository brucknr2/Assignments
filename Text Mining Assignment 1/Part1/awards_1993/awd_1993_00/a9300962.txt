Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to examine the behavior of the               
              modified barrier method on linear and nonlinear programming in                 
              order to understand better the relationships between empirical                 
              and theoretical behavior.  A variety of modified barrier methods               
              will be studied.  The modified barrier method of the PI is a very              
              general approach for solving linear and nonlinear programming                  
              problems.  This area has applications to a variety of important                
              problems in engineering, particularly in the design of minimal                 
              weight structures.
