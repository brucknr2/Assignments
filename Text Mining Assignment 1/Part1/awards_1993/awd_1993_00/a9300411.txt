Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Oregon State University (OSU) will operate the R/V WECOMA                 
              during 1993 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-               
              funded research projects.  The R/V WECOMA is a 177' general                    
              research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and                   
              constructed in 1975.  The vessel will undergo a mid-life refit and             
              general upgrade in 1993/1994.  OSU operates the WECOMA under a                 
              charter agreement with NSF.  The ship is scheduled for 197                     
              operating days in 1993, of which 138 days will be in support of                
              NSF-sponsored programs.  The cruises will be in the north and south            
              pacific ocean for TOGA, JGOFS, COARE, HOTS and individual programs.            
                   This vessel is part of a fleet used by NSF to support                     
              oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research requires                  
              highly specialized equipment that must be permanently installed on             
              a ship for which the ship must be specifically designed.  This                 
              equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance            
              and operation.  These vessels do not operate in the same manner as             
              general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the                  
              operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to                    
              oceanographic research that are operated by universities and                   
              research institutions around the country.
