Abstract    :
              The objective of this Workshop is to bring together in one                     
              place a group of specialists of localization and bifurcation                   
              analysis of geomaterials, to collect and debate the main                       
              results obtained during the past three years, and to                           
              evaluate the perspectives open by new experimental                             
              methods and analytical/numerical tools. The scope of                           
              the Workshop includes the experimental methods and                             
              results, analytical solutions, and numerical methods/solutions.                
              Besides fundamental research findings, applications in mining,                 
              petroleum, and building industries will be presented.
