                                                This three year project will survey and
              database the Miocene and Pliocene marine invertebrate fossil faunas of tropical
              America in order to test and study hypotheses of biotic responses to the
              closing of the Panamanian sea corridor between the Caribbean and Pacific
              seaways.  During the Neogene, this closure split the tropical marine realm and
              produced oceanic changes and biotic isolation on opposite sides of Central
              America.  The survey, which will occur in a fine scaled stratigraphic
              framework, will include geographic, sedimentologic, stratigraphic,
              paleoecologic, and taxonomic datasets.  Most of the fauna consists of
              bryozoans, foraminifera and molluscs, which will be subjected to faunal
              analyses and employed in paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic determinations. 
              The resultant collections will also be used in systematic and phylogenetic
              studies of constituent groups and in training students in paleobiology.  The
              project has longstanding collaboration with facilities and investigators at the
              Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. %%% During the Miocene and
              Pliocene epochs    20 million to 2 million years ago    the Panamanian sea
              corridor between the Caribbean and the Pacific  became constricted and finally
              closed, splitting what had been a continuous seaway into two discrete marine
              realms on either side of Central America.  This closure produced wholesale
              oceanic and biotic changes, including extinctions, migrations and the
              development of many new marine species.  The project will survey the marine
              fossil faunas of tropical America from this time period in order to study these
              change s and correlate the impacts on the marine organisms of the closing of
              the Panamanian seaway.  The survey will include geographic, geologic and
              paleontologic datasets.  Most of the fossil animals are bryozoans, foraminifera
              and molluscs, which will be subjected to faunal analyses and employed in
              paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic determinations.  The resultant collections
              will also be used to reconstruct the history of these organisms and in training
              students in paleobiology.  The project is extremely important in charting
              responses in the marine realm to geological events. ***
