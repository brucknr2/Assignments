Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will be                   
              established at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.  The focus             
              in this program is on astronomy and astrophysics.  The students                
              will be chosen on a competitive basis from applications from around            
              the country but especially from the southern United States.  There             
              are seven Astronomy Research Faculty at Alabama with whom the                  
              students will become involved in doing active research projects.               
              Through the use of research activities and coordinated seminars on             
              astronomy and research techniques, good research skills will be                
              developed in undergraduate science students.  Continued interest in            
              astronomy will be emphasized and the students' progress will be                
              tracked through continued contact with the students after they have            
              participated in our program.  The REU site will be operated during             
              the summers of 1993 and 1994.//
