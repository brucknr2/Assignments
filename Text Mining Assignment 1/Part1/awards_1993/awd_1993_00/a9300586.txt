Abstract    :
              This  award provides funds to the Department of Natural                        
              Resources at Cornell University to  initiate a nine-week                       
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates project in the                         
              environmental sciences.  Eleven students, half of whom will                    
              be from predominantly minority institutions and half of whom                   
              will be from Cornell will be selected to participate. To aid                   
              students in understanding the connection between their                         
              research and real-life concerns of communities, student                        
              research projects will be identified, the results of which                     
              have important applications to solving environmental                           
              problems. Example research topics include Design of Optimal                    
              Composting Systems, Microbially-Mediated Destruction of CFCs                   
              in Anaerobic Environments, Long-term Change in a Deciduous                     
              Forest, and Genetic Variability in Small Isolated                              
              Populations. A one-week orientation and weekly group                           
              sessions will include discussions of the research process,                     
              how to ask insightful questions of research mentors, and the                   
              applications of scientific knowledge to solving problems in                    
              minority communities. Academic-year faculty advisors will                      
              visit the students on their research assignments and will                      
              assist the students in writing up their research for                           
              publication.
