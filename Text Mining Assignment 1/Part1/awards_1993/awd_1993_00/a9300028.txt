Abstract    :
                   This REU site award will provide support for eight                        
              undergraduate researchers.  Each student will work with a single               
              faculty member for a period of eight weeks.  Research topics                   
              include: Root systems and Weyl groups, modeling uncertainty in                 
              economics, topology of planar linkages, logic with diagrams and                
              speech recognition by computers.  Students will meet privately                 
              with faculty advisors two or three times each week.  Students                  
              will be expected to give lectures on their work and to prepare                 
              final written reports.  Student interaction will be encouraged                 
              through theses presentations, by the proximity of their working                
              arrangements and through common living facilities on campus.                   
              This project continues a long tradition of undergraduate research              
              participation at Indiana University reaching back to the original              
              URPP program sponsored by NSF and continuing via individual grant              
              support when the URPP was discontinued.
