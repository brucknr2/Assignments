Abstract    :
              The University of Texas at Arlington's Department of Electrical                
              Engineering is conducting a Research Experiences for Undergraduates            
              program.  The program will be the participation of undergraduate               
              scholars in research projects and the significant interaction                  
              between faculty and students.  There will be an academic year                  
              component, open to all qualified scholars, and a summer component,             
              designed to emphasize the participation of underrepresented                    
              minorities.  The scholars will be expected to exhibit qualities                
              such as creativity, productivity, effective communication, and                 
              independence upon completion of their training in the program.                 
              Students will participate in the complete research process.  They              
              will select a research topic with their faculty mentor, write a                
              research proposal, perform a literature search, attend and                     
              participate in an Ethics Forum, conduct the research, analyze data,            
              write progress and final reports, present the work orally, and                 
              evaluate the experience.
