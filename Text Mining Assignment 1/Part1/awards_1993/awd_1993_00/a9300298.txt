Abstract    :
                   The REU award provides support for three undergraduates                   
              working under the principal investigator's supervision on                      
              problems related to differential equations and numerical                       
              analysis.  They will focus on oscillation theory of differential               
              equations with deviating arguments and on interative methods for               
              the numerical solutions of nonlinear systems of algebraic                      
              equations.  Students will be expected to write up their work and               
              present it at professional meetings where appropriate.
