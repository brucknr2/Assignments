Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis and                                
              characterization of functionalized fulleroids that have the                    
              potential to bind to the active site of retroviral reverse                     
              transcriptases (RT) as well as the HIV protease (HIVP).

              With this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), the                     
              Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.                    
              Fred Wudl of the Institute for Polymers and Organic Solids at                  
              the University of California, Santa Barbara.  The focus of the                 
              research is the synthesis of novel functionalized hollow                       
              spheroidal molecules, fulleroids, that have the potential to be                
              retrovirus-specific, biologically active molecules.
