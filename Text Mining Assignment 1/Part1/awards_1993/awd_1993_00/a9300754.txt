Abstract    :
              Structurally simple, highly dispersed, supported metal catalysts               
              are prepared and characterized.  The catalysts are prepared from               
              organometallic precursors which are converted into                             
              organometallic clusters of defined structures on the surfaces                  
              of basic supports (magnesia and lanthana); subsequent                          
              decarbonylation gives clusters of supported metal atoms with the               
              same number of atoms as the precursors.  The metals used in this               
              study are iridium and platinum.  Samples are characterized with                
              infrared spectroscopy, extended X-ray adsorption fine structure                
              (EXAFS), and transmission electron microscopy; catalytic                       
              activities and selectives are measured for hydrocarbon                         
              conversion reactions.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This is a fundamental study of the effects of dispersion near                  
              the upper limit (or, equivalently, the effects of cluster size                 
              in small clusters) on the catalytic properties of metals.  The                 
              issue is a critical one for the optimization of systems                        
              employing rare-metal catalysts for a variety of industry energy                
              and environmental purposes.
