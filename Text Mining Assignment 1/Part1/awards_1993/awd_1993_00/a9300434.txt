Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PIs will build an array (or cage) of thermistors/thermoscouples            
              for measuring temperatures of hydrothermal vents over long periods             
              of time.  They will use a modular design so that rebuilding and                
              refurbishing of the thermocouples may be done quickly.  The Pis                
              will test two such packages using ALVIN in 1994 Summer Development             
              of such a package is of great interest to the hydrothermal                     
              subcommunity of RIDGE scientists.
