Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support to The University of Minnesota to                  
              continue the summer program of undergraduate research experiences              
              in the behavioral sciences established in 1987.  The ten-week                  
              program will emphasize student participation in the research                   
              activities of faculty affiliated with the Center for Research in               
              Learning Perception and Cognition.  Eleven undergraduates will                 
              participate, about two thirds from smaller liberal arts colleges               
              and universities and one-third from the University of Minnesota.               
              Students will: (1) assist with their faculty mentor's research,                
              working as a member of their research team, (2) complete a research            
              project including a written report and presentation to peers and               
              participating faculty, and (3) participate in a multidisciplinary              
              seminar.  The program will therefore include opportunities for                 
              students to learn specific research methods, to apply these methods            
              in the context of their own research, and to examine broad                     
              conceptual and methodological issues relating to psychology and the            
              cognitive sciences.  Participation in special social/cultural                  
              events as well as common housing in a University dorm will help                
              foster a strong community of students.                                         
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to               
              attract talented students into careers in science through active               
              undergraduate research experiences.
