Abstract    :
              9300146  Dyer    This award will support collaborative research  between Charles
              R. Dyer, University of Wisconsin,  and Marco Ferretti, University of Pavia,
              Italy.  The  research will attempt to exploit parallel  programming models to
              overcome existing problems in  shape and motion analysis.  It will include
              research  on designing and implementing parallel computer  vision algorithms
              for high-performance parallel  computers.  Data-parallel methods will be
              developed  for the intermediate-level vision tasks of two-  dimensional and
              three-dimensional shape analysis,  and motion analysis.    Each researcher
              brings complementary strengths to  this cooperative effort.  Dyer has developed
              a  number of new techniques in the areas of three-  dimensional object
              representation, object  recognition, motion analysis, and methods for active 
              visual three-dimensional shape recovery and  exploration using continuous,
              directed observer  motion.  Ferretti has studied extensively the 
              implementation of parallel algorithms on a wide  range of custom and
              general-purpose parallel  computers.  The researchers will collaborate on 
              defined problems of mutual interest that will  enhance both groups' abilities
              to develop new  techniques and implement parallel programs to test  these
              methods.  ***
