Abstract    :
                   This REU site award supports six undergraduate research                   
              students who will work under the supervision of research faculty               
              on mathematical problems in five areas.  They include harmonic                 
              analysis and the phi-transform, complex analysis and differential              
              equations, population genetics, image processing and                           
              combinatorial number theory.  Seven faculty will be involved at                
              various stages of the program. Regularly scheduled meetings                    
              together with informal discussions are used to develop                         
              interactions among the students and faculty. Although not                      
              required, students will be encouraged to prepare their results                 
              for presentation and publication.  As Washington University is                 
              one of the preeminent research institutions in the country, the                
              students have an exceptional opportunity to meet many of the                   
              visitors who pass through the campus during the summer.
