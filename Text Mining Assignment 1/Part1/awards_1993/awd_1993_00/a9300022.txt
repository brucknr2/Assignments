Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor Sita at the California Institute of Technology who will              
              provide new experimental data on polystannanes that can be used to             
              test the accuracy and reliability of predictions at the ab initio              
              level of theory concerning the structures, stabilities, and                    
              properties of these group 14-heavy-atom analogs of organic                     
              molecules. New types of protecting groups will be developed that               
              can be used in conjunction with the Sn-Sn bond forming                         
              hydrostannolysis reaction for the programmed construction of                   
              complex polystannane structures that include linear oligomers,                 
              branched dendrimers, propellanes, prismanes, and bicyclic                      
              structures.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project Professor Lawrence R. Sita will develop new and                
              expand current strategies to synthesize linear oligomers, branched             
              dendrimers, propellanes, prismanes, and other bicyclic polystannane            
              structures. The targeted organo-tin compounds have the same tin-               
              framework as the carbon skeletons in the lighter hydrocarbon                   
              analogues. Sita's study will catapult organo-tin chemistry to the              
              forefront by providing valuable insight into its scope and                     
              limitations that will be important to materials applications and               
              theoretical insight alike.
