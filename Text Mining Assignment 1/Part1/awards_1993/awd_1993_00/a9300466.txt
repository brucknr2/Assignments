Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Northeast Missouri State                      
              University (NMSU) Science Division to continue a successful                    
              NSF-REU program .  During the summers of 1993 and 1994 seven                   
              undergraduate students will be given  financial support to                     
              allow them to participate in and  intensive, full-time                         
              research experience.  As demonstration of its strong                           
              commitment to undergraduate research, NMSU will make several                   
              contributions, including: clerical support, free on-campus                     
              room and board and a waiver of tuition and fees for 3                          
              college credits to student participants.                                       
                                                                                             
              Students, 3 from NMSU and 4 from off-campus, and 7 faculty                     
              mentors will form a research team, focusing on the study of                    
              a single system: grass/fungi endosymbioses. Students will be                   
              selected based on their independence and motivation,                           
              research potential, and professional goals. Discussions                        
              between student and mentor will form the basis for  matching                   
              students to specific research areas. Students will work in                     
              research areas that range widely from chemical analysis of                     
              fungal alkaloids, to ecological and physiological                              
              implications for grasses of harboring a fungus, to effects                     
              of fungal alkaloids on insect and mammalian consumers of the                   
              fungus. The central focus will integrate study at different                    
              levels of biological organization and will help foster unity                   
              and community among group members. The program includes                        
              several opportunities for students to communicate their work                   
              to others, including a required oral presentation of their                     
              findings, and is aimed to develop project ownership by the                     
              student.
