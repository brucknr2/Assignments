Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in two areas.  First the                     
              principal investigator will study permutation representations.                 
              He will classify all monodromy groups of primitive branched                    
              coverings of Riemann surfaces which are sufficiently large in                  
              terms of the genus.  He will also consider similar problems over               
              finite fields and their algebraic closures, and over number                    
              fields.  In addition, he will consider problems involving                      
              nonconjugate subgroups which induce the same permutation                       
              representation.  The second major area of investigation is matrix              
              theory.  In particular, the principal investigator will determine              
              what can be said about the minimal polynomial of a symmetric                   
              matrix over the integers.  He also intends to investigate the                  
              structure of the variety of commuting r-tuples of matrices.                    
                   A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.                
              It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and               
              chemistry.  The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are               
              finite simple groups.  One of the major results in mathematics of              
              the past decade is the classification of the finite simple                     
              groups,  the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000                     
              journal pages.  This research is aimed at using this                           
              classification in the study of arbitrary finite groups and other               
              algebraic structures.
