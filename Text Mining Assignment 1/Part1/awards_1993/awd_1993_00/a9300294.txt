Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue a successful Research                    
              Experiences for Undergraduates Site program in the                             
              Department of Biological Sciences at the University of                         
              Missouri-Columbia.  The program is designed to provide                         
              research opportunities for students from primarily                             
              undergraduate institutions. The Department  will work in                       
              partnership with a select group of such schools, including                     
              three minority institutions and a women's college, to                          
              provide their students the kind of research experience only                    
              available at a major comprehensive research university. This                   
              REU program will also complement and partially supplement an                   
              internship program for MU students funded by the Howard                        
              Hughes Medical Institute.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This program follows the successful completion of a Summer                     
              1990 prototype project, funded by the University and a grant                   
              from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and  1991 and 1992                    
              NSF-REU site grants. Faculty participant's research programs                   
              center on the theme "Cellular, Molecular and Genetic                           
              Approaches to Biological Problems," and utilize methodology                    
              ranging from recombinant DNA technology, to                                    
              immunocytochemistry, to sophisticated electrophysiology. All                   
              participating faculty are personally involved in their                         
              research projects, are well-funded, and have a history of                      
              successful partnerships with undergraduate interns.                            
                                                                                             
              The research experience is the cornerstone of the summer                       
              program. Multiple and varied opportunities will be provided                    
              for the students to develop their communication skills, and                    
              mentors will help students present their research at local                     
              and regional scientific meetings. Finally, a number of                         
              enrichment activities have been developed including seminars                   
              by research faculty, informal evening programs, and a panel                    
              discussion on graduate schools.
