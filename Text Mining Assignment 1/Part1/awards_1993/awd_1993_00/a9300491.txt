Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project examines the applicability of a newly developed bio-              
              optical instrument (pump and probe fluorometer) that may be able to            
              measure the "health" of oceanic phytoplankton.  In theory, this                
              instrument provides a means for non-destructive measurement of                 
              phytoplankton photosynthesis without recourse to calibration                   
              against standard biological measurements.  The technique, if                   
              successfully proven, will be able to establish the nutrient status             
              of phytoplankton from measurements of photosynthetic efficiency.               
              Present studies indicate that photosynthetic efficiency of                     
              phytoplankton is independent of temperature and irradiance under               
              nutrient replete conditions, but decreases under nutrient                      
              limitation.  This project is designed to thoroughly test the                   
              instrument under controlled laboratory conditions using three                  
              different species of phytoplankton whose growth rates are                      
              controlled by limiting nitrate, phosphate, silicate, and iron.                 
              Such information is crucial to the development of a quantitative               
              understanding of environmental regulation of primary productivity              
              in the sea.
