Abstract    :
              9300835 Dutta          The goal of this research is to remedy the growing
              disparity between computer aided process planning and computer aided
              manufacturing, the two vital components in a computer integrated manufacturing
              system.  In particular it develops a computer aided process planning system
              that generates process plans for machining operations on parallel machines.  On
              these next generation numerically controlled (NC) machines, multiple tools can
              simultaneously machine a single workpiece and multiple workpieces can be
              machined simultaneously.  Most importantly, on such machines a workpiece can be
              completely finished in a single setup, resulting in shorter cycle times and
              significantly i proved tolerances.            This project includes a novel
              concept, that of automatic disassembly to generate machining sequences and
              maximize parallelism.  Results of the research will positively impact the
              capabilities of future computer integrated manufacturing systems by enabling
              them to include parallel machine tools.
