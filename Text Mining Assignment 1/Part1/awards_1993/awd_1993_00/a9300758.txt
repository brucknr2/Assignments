Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral              
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of the processes by              
              which   male and female resident physicians choose their  medical              
              specialties.   It  will  be carried out  through  both  telephone              
              surveys  and  intensive,  face-to-face interviews  with  resident              
              physicians  in  Nashville,  TN.   Results  will  be  analyzed  to              
              determine  the  extent  to  which the processes  by  which  women              
              physicians tend disproportionately to end up in specialties  such              
              as    pediatrics   and   gynecology   involve   constraints   and              
              discrimination versus preferences and values.                                  
                                                                                             
                    This  research  will contribute to a very active  field  of              
              research on the nature of the processes producing sex segregation              
              among  occupations.  In addition to the scientific  gains  to  be              
              achieved  by  the research, this award will materially  assist  a              
              highly  promising student in completing research  for  the  Ph.D.              
              dissertation.   Thus  it  contributes to  the  future  scientific              
              manpower  of  the nation and the thorough training  of  the  next              
              generation of sociologists.
