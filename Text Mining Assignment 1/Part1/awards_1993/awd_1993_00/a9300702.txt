Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The patterns and causes of arctic decade- to century-scale                
              climate variability are poorly understood, most significantly                  
              because annually-dated records of past environmental change from               
              this region are sparse.  This award supports the retrieval of a                
              Baffin Island network of climate records spanning the last 500 to              
              2000 years.  Cores will be collected from three lakes.  The varve              
              chronologies will be tested rigorously using 210-Pb and bomb                   
              radionuclides.  Annually-dated time series of fossil pollen, varve             
              thickness, and Ge/Si ratios will be generated.  This effort will               
              yield the first network of annually-dated paleoclimate and                     
              paleoecological time series from arctic lake sediments.  This                  
              project will be the first PALE (Paleoclimates for Arctic Lakes and             
              Estuaries) effort to map out the patterns of decade-to century-                
              scale change of the past 1000 years.
