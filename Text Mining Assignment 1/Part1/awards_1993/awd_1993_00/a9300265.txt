Abstract    :
              Dr. Lowell D. Kispert and other members of the Chemistry Department            
              of University of Alabama are being supported to continue a Research            
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the               
              period 1993-5, twelve undergraduate students will spend ten weeks              
              each summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                
              Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,                  
              inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature of            
              this program is the primary focus is on students from small                    
              colleges including minority institutions east of the Mississippi               
              that do not have facilities to carry out research.
