Abstract    :
              CHEN  9300512  The object of this study is to understand the specific mechanisms
              in which the 3-D mid-ocean topography is controlled by various loading forces
              arising from ridge segmentation. In the first phase of the study, a new 3-D
              ridge thermal model will be developed that will include heat input associated
              with along-axis variations in crustal emplacement, crustal hydrothermal
              cooling, and lateral heat transfer across the steep walls of rift valleys and
              transform troughs. In the second phase, the hypothesis that the observed ridge
              morphology is generated from the 3-D lithospheric deformation will be tested.
              And in the third phase, the results of the theoretical models will be compared
              with data from four well surveyed areas of the mid-ocean ridge.
