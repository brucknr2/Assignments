Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with various areas of                           
              noncommutative ring theory.  The principal investigator will                   
              study PI rings and their representations focusing on applications              
              to linear groups, the behavior of normalizing elements and the                 
              embeddability of PI rings into matrices.  Affine prime rings with              
              Gelfand-Kirillov dimension two will also be investigated with the              
              goal of determining when they are primitive.  Finally, rings of                
              invariants of reductive groups on certain noncommutative algebras              
              will be considered.                                                            
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring              
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                           
              multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                 
              satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                 
              not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                         
              multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                     
              matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                 
              has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing              
              significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.
