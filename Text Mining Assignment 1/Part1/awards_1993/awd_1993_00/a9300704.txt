Abstract    :
                   This research program examines mechanisms of dealloying, or               
              selective removal (SR), of a component from metal alloys.  Several             
              experimental techniques, atom probe field ion microscopy (AP-FIM),             
              scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM),               
              and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, are employed that are              
              state-of-the-art to characterize the SR process at the nanometer               
              level in real time.  A model of SR mechanism has been developed,               
              and the research involves testing and improving the model.  The                
              relationships between alloy composition, environment, reaction                 
              rate, temperature, time, and pore formation and size are examined.

                   The subject is of wide ranging technological importance from              
              catalysis to stress corrosion cracking to high temperature                     
              oxidation.
