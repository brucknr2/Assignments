Abstract    :
              In this project, supported by the Analytical and Surface                       
              Chemistry Program, Professor Nuzzo will carry out a                            
              comprehensive study of the activated adsorption and                            
              decomposition of organometallic CVD precursors.  The early                     
              stages of metallization in CVD will be explored, with emphasis                 
              on the reactive chemistry of organoaluminum reagents on                        
              oxidized and elemental silicon surfaces, and the nucleation of                 
              metal overlayers on these surfaces.  Molecular beam  and                       
              surface spectroscopic methods will be combined to probe the                    
              detailed mechanisms of these technologically important                         
              reactions.  In addition, a generalized method for directly                     
              depositing patterned metal films will be developed using self                  
              assembled monolayer chemistry.  The results of this research                   
              project will be very useful in developing an understanding of                  
              important electronic materials process chemistry.

              The initial stages of metal thin film deposition on important                  
              electronic materials will be examined in this research project                 
              in the Nuzzo laboratory at the University of Illinois-Urbana                   
              Champaign.  Detailed examination of the mechanism of                           
              organometallic precursors for chemical vapor deposition of                     
              metal layers will be carried out.  Patterned film deposition                   
              will also be explored using self assembled monolayer chemistry                 
              developed in the Nuzzo laboratory.
