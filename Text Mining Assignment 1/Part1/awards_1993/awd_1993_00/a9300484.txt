Abstract    :
                   Improved, reliable accelerometers suitable for wide deployment            
              in seismic arrays are needed for the measurement of ground                     
              displacements due to earthquakes, earthquake precursors, and                   
              man-made seismic events.  Improvements are sought in broad-band                
              sensor response down to fractional Hertz, with wide dynamic range,             
              high reliability, and reduced maintenance costs.  Wide dynamic                 
              range devices capable of measuring both small seismic events                   
              (precursors) and also severe earthquakes are needed.  In response              
              to this need, Optical Technologies (OPTECH), a Division of Dynamic             
              Systems, Inc., proposes to research and develop a laboratory                   
              prototype, Triaxial Fiber-Optic Seismometer (TFOS).  Using phase               
              measuring and reset-counting demodulation, the resulting device                
              will be capable of detecting seismic signals in a range of from                
              subnano-g up to approximately 0.23grms.  Thus, the measurement span            
              of the Phase II triaxial seismometer prototype is expected to                  
              exceed 170 dB.
