Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Graduate School at Baylor                     
              College of Medicine (BCM) to continue a successful Research                    
              Experiences for Undergraduates SITE.  Ten undergraduates                       
              selected from a nationwide pool of hundreds of applicants                      
              will be exposed to research in a 1O-week summer career                         
              development program. Participants will be selected by a                        
              committee composed of faculty from each basic science                          
              department. Students will be matched with faculty mentors                      
              and become functioning members of their laboratories. The                      
              unifying focus of the REU Site will be cellular signal                         
              transduction. BCM has an outstanding reputation in this area                   
              of fundamental biological research involving a number of                       
              departments including Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Molecular                    
              Physiology and Biophysics and Neuroscience. The projects                       
              that will be offered will involve subjects and techniques                      
              that will be appropriate for students with a diversity of                      
              interests and backgrounds. The faculty of BCM have already                     
              gained experience in designing undergraduate research                          
              projects and interacting with college students through                         
              participation in a 4 year program and 1 year as an REU Site.                   
              The laboratory oriented aspect of the program will be                          
              supplemented by students' participation in research                            
              discussions, seminars, career development activities and                       
              social/cultural activities sponsored through the SMART                         
              Program by the Graduate School. NSF sponsored participants                     
              will have the benefit of interacting with 100 other                            
              undergraduates from throughout the nation who will be                          
              supported by other sources and of entering an established                      
              program that effectively promotes interest in science and                      
              prepares undergraduates to enter research oriented careers.
