Abstract    :
                   Twelve undergraduate students from across the nation will                 
              spend ten weeks during the summer at the J. R. Macdonald                       
              Laboratory at Kansas State University to engage in research in                 
              experimental and theoretical atomic physics.  Many exciting                    
              and challenging experiments in atomic collisions are being                     
              carried out at the JRM Laboratory which is equipped with a                     
              variety of accelerators and a new EBIS source for producing                    
              multiply charged ions.  These undergraduate students will                      
              share the excitement of research and to gain experience in                     
              using these unique facilities through their participation in                   
              carrying out research with the large body of faculty and                       
              graduate students in the JRM Laboratory.  This experience will                 
              help students in making decisions toward a career in                           
              scientific research.
