Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of Jewish                        
              Christianity, a religious movement that presents a challenge to                
              conventional Jewish communities, and of how they respond to it.  As            
              a contribution to the sociology of religion, this will offer a rare            
              examination of the tension involving both sides after a schism.                
              For sociology more generally, it will extend research on socio-                
              cultural boundary maintenance and the responses of cohesive groups             
              to identity challenges.                                                        
                                                                                             
                   Religion is a topic of renewed interest to sociologists, and              
              this study will be part of the fresh wave of research that is                  
              currently revitalizing this important field.  In addition to the               
              scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will               
              materially assist a highly promising student in completing research            
              for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to future                     
              scientific manpower and the thorough training of the next                      
              generation of sociologists.
