Abstract    :
              A Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is established               
              at the Combustion/Fluid Dynamics laboratory in the Department of               
              Aerospace Engineering, Mechanics and Engineering Science at the                
              University of Florida.  Eight projects, at a level of complexity               
              appropriate for undergraduate students and for a duration of ten               
              weeks, have been identified.  All these individual projects                    
              constitute components of an ongoing research program in the area               
              of high speed, chemically reacting flows.  The undergraduates                  
              participating in this program will have access to the extensive                
              facilities and instrumentation available in the laboratory and to              
              other support facilities.  They will continuously interact with                
              each other and with the graduate students involved in the same                 
              research program.  They will be advised by three faculty members               
              who are currently coordinating this research.  The undergraduate               
              students will be recruited primarily from the University of Puerto             
              Rico in Mayaguez and Florida A&M, both minority institutions.
