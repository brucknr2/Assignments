Abstract    :
                   This proposal is a request for support from the National                  
              Science Foundation for a conference primarily on 3 and 4-                      
              dimensional topology, to be held at the University of Georgia,                 
              August 2-3,1993.                                                               
                   Since 1961 the University of Georgia has organized and                    
              hosted a major international topology conference every 8 years.                
              The 1993 conference will reflect the tremendous current interest               
              in 3 and 4-dimensional topology.  Among the topics that will be                
              discussed by invited speakers are gauge theory, topological                    
              quantum field theory, new invariants of 3 and 4-manifolds,                     
              progress on the geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds, and                 
              new approaches to knot theory.  These topics have developed very               
              rapidly in recent years and our conference will give researchers               
              and opportunity to explore the connections between them.
