Abstract    :
              The Undergraduate Summer Fellowships in Orthopaedic Bioengineering             
              program at the Hospital for Joint Diseases is a continuation of a              
              similar program held for the past eleven years.  This Research                 
              Experiences for Undergraduates program is based on the premise that            
              the ideal place to supplement the basic education of bioengineers              
              with practical experience and expose them to "real-life" situations            
              of the sort that will characterize their future careers is in the              
              intense medical environment of a teaching hospital.  Such                      
              experience is critical to the education of engineers and scientists            
              who will create new concepts and develop, design, and manufacture              
              medical devices.  Such training is necessary to maintain and expand            
              the competitive edge enjoyed by the U.S. medical device industry,              
              whose products are recognized as being the world's best.  The                  
              program's projects, chosen from ongoing Departmental research                  
              activities with independent funding sources, will involve ligament             
              and cartilage repair, spinal fixation, fracture repair, physical               
              chemistry of biomineralization, mechanical and electromagnetic                 
              effects on tissue growth, and total joint design.
