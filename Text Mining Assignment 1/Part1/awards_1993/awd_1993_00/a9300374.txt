Abstract    :
              The Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at Penn State              
              directly addresses the challenge of increasing enrollment of women             
              and minorities in graduate engineering study.  The key aspects of              
              the program are:  1) the active recruitment of minorities and women            
              by visiting selected target schools, and , 2) a student oriented               
              research program that contains social as well as instructional                 
              aspects designed for successful integration of the participants                
              into an exciting research environment.  Faculty members from the               
              Department of Chemical Engineering at Penn State have volunteered              
              to support recruitment, instruction, and research supervision.                 
              The projects offered span a wide range of research, from plant                 
              tissue culture, to thermodynamics - held together by common                    
              chemical engineering principles.  REU participants will be matched             
              with projects prior to selection to maximize mutual interests and              
              capabilities.  The participants enroll for three credits of                    
              Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Research during the summer                  
              semester.  An instructional program is integrated throughout the               
              summer which initially focuses on logistics such as the library                
              system and laboratory safety to give the students a quick start on             
              research.  Subsequent instruction covers research practice such as             
              experimental design, statistics, and "keeping a laboratory                     
              notebook".  To stress the importance of communication, an                      
              introductory and final oral presentation, as well as a final                   
              written report will be required of each student.
