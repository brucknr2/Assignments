Abstract    :
                   In recent years it has become increasingly recognized that  brominated
              compounds (BrC's) in the atmosphere may play a  significant role in
              stratospheric ozone depletion, especially in  the Antarctic and Arctic regions.
               Most of the attention, to date,  concerning stratospheric ozone depletion has
              centered on the role  of chlorinated compounds (ClC's), due in part to their
              relatively  high concentrations in the troposphere, now totaling well over a 
              part per billion (mole ratio).  One of the greatest challenges  associated with
              atmospheric studies of the BrC's is related to  their relatively low
              concentrations in the troposphere, typically  in the low or sub parts per
              trillion range.  The BrC's are  therefore relatively difficult to detect and
              quantitatively analyze  in atmospheric samples that invariably contain a large
              excess of  other organic compounds, including the ClC's.  In this research, a 
              new instrument, will be applied to the analysis of BrC's in  atmospheric
              samples.  This instrument is called the SiF4-doped  Photodetachment-Modulated
              Electron Capture Detector (SiF4-PDMECD)  and has been shown to provide
              sensitive responses to BrC's, but  does not respond to ClC's or other organic
              compounds.  In this  project, the SiF4-PDMECD will be evaluated specifically
              for the  analysis of BrC's in the atmosphere and will thereby provide the 
              field of atmospheric chemistry with an additional and very possibly  a superior
              analysis capability for future investigations of the  atmospheric chemistry of
              brominated compounds.
