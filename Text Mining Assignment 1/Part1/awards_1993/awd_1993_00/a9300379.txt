Abstract    :
              This award provides ongoing support to The Jackson                             
              Laboratory, a private, non-profit research institution, to                     
              continue their Research Experience for Undergraduates Site.                    
              Undergraduate science students with exceptional ability have                   
              been participating as research apprentices since 1929 at The                   
              Jackson Laboratory, . Twelve undergraduates, selected from                     
              300 applicants nationwide, are exposed to all aspects of the                   
              research process by conducting hands-on, basic research in                     
              mammalian genetics for 10 or 12 weeks in the summer  under                     
              the sponsorship of staff scientists. The students' projects                    
              are components of their sponsors' independent, investigator-                   
              initiated research programs. Inbred and mutant laboratory                      
              mice are utilized in many projects. All students are from                      
              outside the host institution; about half are from                              
              baccalaureate colleges.  Students with diverse science                         
              preparations are accepted, with each participant's project                     
              tailored to his or her background . Students' work at the                      
              bench is supplemented by group sessions on careers, ethics,                    
              critical scientific thinking, and a formal student                             
              symposium. Follow-up activities, including affiliations with                   
              graduate schools, foster the students' continuing                              
              participation in science. 100% of the  REU participants who                    
              have graduated are now in graduate or medical school or are                    
              employed in science. Long-term studies of program alumni                       
              show that a very high percentage receive doctoral degrees in                   
              the biological sciences or medicine.
