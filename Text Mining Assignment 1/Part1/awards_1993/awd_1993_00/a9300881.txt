Abstract    :
                   The research entails considering problems concerning                      
              conformally equivalent metrics on classes of Riemannian                        
              manifolds, classes of spectral invariants of metrics and                       
              conformally invariant energy functions of maps.  Related to these              
              are m-powers of the energy density of maps between Riemannian                  
              manifolds.  Extremals of these integrated densities lead to the                
              notion of harmonic maps, generalizing the case m=1.
