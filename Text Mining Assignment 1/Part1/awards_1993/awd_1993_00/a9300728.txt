Abstract    :
                   This proposal applies diffraction analysis to the local atomic            
              structure of crystalline solids, in particular superconducting                 
              oxides and related materials.  Initial studies include the effects             
              of dynamics on the pulsed neutron powder diffraction (Plazcek                  
              correction) and the direct observation of lattice dynamics using               
              pulsed neutrons.  This research is followed by diffraction studies             
              of single crystals using a novel technique of two-dimensional pair             
              distribution function analysis.  The observations are examined in              
              the context of the mechanism of superconductivity based upon                   
              carrier-induced local lattice deformation (polaron formation).  In             
              the process of these studies the real space method of diffraction              
              analysis is further developed.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
                   The data derived from these experiments are pertinent to                  
              furthering the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms of high             
              temperature superconductivity.
