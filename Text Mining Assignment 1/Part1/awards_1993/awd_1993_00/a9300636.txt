Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Michigan will operate R/V LAURENTIAN during 1993             
              as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research            
              projects.  The LAURENTIAN is a 80' general research vessel                     
              constructed in 1974.  It is owned by the University of Michigan.               
              The ship is scheduled for 84 operating days in 1993, of which 74               
              days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship operates              
              primarily in the Great Lakes.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                    
              Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                   
              oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                     
              equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                
              increasing number of research projects require equipment that must             
              be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship much be              
              specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires highly trained            
              crew members for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not              
              operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and            
              therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels                  
              specifically dedicated to oceanographic research.  These vessels               
              are operated by universities and research institution around the               
              country.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The R/V LAURENTIAN is a capable vessel for the work proposed.  The             
              program considers the ship important part of the fleet due to its              
              location.  The Laurentian is the only UNOLS vessel hat operates in             
              the Great Lakes, and the University of Michigan should be                      
              encouraged to improve usage of the vessel.
