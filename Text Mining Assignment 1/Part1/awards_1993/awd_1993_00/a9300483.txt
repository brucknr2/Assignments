Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Detailed design, initiated in Phase I, of a laboratory prototype of            
              a fully automatic, fiber-fed astronomical spectrograph will be                 
              completed during this Phase II effort.  The spectrograph will then             
              be fabricated and laboratory experiments will be conducted with it             
              to determine if the system performs as predicted during the Phase              
              I study, and which of several key components work best.  Based on              
              the results of these laboratory experiments, the laboratory                    
              prototype will be appropriately modified, and the spectrograph will            
              be evaluated via fully automated spectrographic observations of                
              stars as part of ongoing scientific research programs of several               
              typical research astronomers.
