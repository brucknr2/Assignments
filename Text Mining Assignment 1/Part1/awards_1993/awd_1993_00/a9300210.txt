Abstract    :
              Paige         This research is on testing the feasibility of a  transformational
              methodology, previously used only for software  productivity improvement,
              within the context of hardware  specification and synthesis.  The research
              involves the designing  and implementing a transformational environment for a
              hardware  specification and synthesis language.  This environment supports 
              VHDL-like specifications, symbolic analysis of these  specifications, and
              correctness preserving source-to-source  transformations.  Two applications are
              being carried out.  The  first emphasizes automatic hardware design in which
              the system is  used to transform algorithmic level hardware specifications into
               register transfer level implementations.  The second application  deals with
              hardware verification by automatic linear time model   checking using a subset
              of temporal logic.
