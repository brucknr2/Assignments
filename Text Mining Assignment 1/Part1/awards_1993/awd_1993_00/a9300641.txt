Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Spencer to work             
              in combinatorics.  Specifically, Professor Spencer is developing               
              the Probabilistic Method for use in dealing with problems in                   
              combinatorics.  The interplay between discrete mathematics and                 
              computer science suggests an algorithmic viewpoint.  Many                      
              probabilistic proofs of existence supply immediately efficient                 
              randomized procedures for the corresponding algorithmic problems,              
              and in some cases these procedures can be derandomized and                     
              converted into deterministic ones.                                             
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems, and            
              the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with discrete            
              objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
