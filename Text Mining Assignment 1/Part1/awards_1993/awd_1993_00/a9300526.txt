Abstract    :
                   The research entails the value distributional geometry of                 
              complex curves in complex hyperbolic spaces.  Ramifications                    
              include a geometric study of several associated number theoretic               
              questions (Diophantine Approximation).  The research also                      
              includes an approach to several problems concerning the Gauss                  
              maps of minimal surfaces in space forms.
