Abstract    :
              9300773  David Sibeck  Transient events in the dayside auroral zone will be
              studied  using data from ground magnetometers, riometers, and radars.   Each
              event that is identified will be placed with a global  context by comparison
              with any available satellite  measurements.  Statistical studies will be used
              to determine  the characteristics and occurrence rates of each type of  event. 
              The study will provide information on the nature of  solar wind-magnetosphere
              interaction processes at the  magnetopause and the signatures of these
              processes in the  ionosphere.  ***
