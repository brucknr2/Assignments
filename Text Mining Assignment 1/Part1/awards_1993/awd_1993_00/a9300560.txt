Abstract    :
              Low dosage transmission medical imaging, emission medical imaging,  and
              nondestructive testing of materials are all examples of  tomographic
              reconstruction problems which can benefit greatly from  improved reconstruction
              techniques.  This research introduces a  strategy for the development of
              computationally efficient  reconstruction algorithms which directly search for
              the  statistically optimal fit to measured data.  This approach exploits  the
              wide availability of digital computation and storage to  substantially improve
              reconstruction in demanding applications.   The research has three essential
              components: 1) A general  measurement system model is being proposed which
              characterizes the  physical measurement apparatus for both the transmission and
               emission problems, and can be extended to include nonlinear effects  such as
              scattering.  2) A new class of computationally tractable  image cross section
              models is being proposed which preserves image  detail while suppressing noise
              artifacts.  3) A fast numerical  algorithm, known as Gauss-Seidel, is proposed
              as a basis for  efficient and accurate multiscale reconstruction methods.   
              Algorithmic techniques are being evaluated using data collected  from the
              Nondestructive Evaluation Section at the Lawrence  Livermore National
              Laboratories.
