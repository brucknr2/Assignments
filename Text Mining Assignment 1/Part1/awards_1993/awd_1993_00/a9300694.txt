Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of chemical sensors.  During the                 
              tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Bright and               
              his students will build upon results derived from previous studies             
              supported under NSF grant CHE-8921517 and employ excited state                 
              fluorescence decay kinetics to study the immobilization of active              
              antibody fragments and their interaction with a soluble antigen.               
              The overall goal of this research is directed toward improving our             
              understanding of biological and synthetic chemical recognition                 
              elements (receptors) immobilized at an interface.

              This research will yield fundamental information on the                        
              thermodynamics and dynamics of surface-immobilized receptors                   
              (artificial and biochemical) thereby providing valuable insights               
              to guide the development of interfaces suitable for chemical                   
              sensing in complex milieu and enable the rational design of a                  
              variety of technologically important receptor-based sensing                    
              devices.
