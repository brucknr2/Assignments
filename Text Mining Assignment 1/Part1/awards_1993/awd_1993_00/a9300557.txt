Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It will be a study of work                     
              attitudes, contrasting male and female workers' group orientation              
              in Japan and the United States, based on statistical analysis of an            
              existing dataset of 8,302 survey respondents.  Statistical                     
              techniques such as regression and path analysis will apply four                
              conceptual approaches: culturalist theory, the cultural contingency            
              model of worker attitudes and behavior, Koike's model of skill                 
              acquisition, and a conflict model of labor control.                            
                                                                                             
                   This research will contribute to the sociology of gender and              
              work roles, as well as to comparative studies of Japan and the                 
              United States, potentially contributing to American industrial                 
              policy.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the             
              research, this award will materially assist a highly promising                 
              student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it            
              contributes to future scientific manpower and the thorough training            
              of the next generation of sociologists.
