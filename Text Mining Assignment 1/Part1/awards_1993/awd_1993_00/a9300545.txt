Abstract    :
                   SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) has permitted             
              undergraduate students to take part in hands-on, research scale                
              geophysical exploration.  Students first complete the four-week                
              field segment of SAGE in the Rio Grande rift of New Mexico.  Here              
              they do research using seismic reflection and refraction, gravity,             
              magnetism, electrical resistivity, electromagnetics, and                       
              magnetotellurics.  They are involved in every phase of the field               
              research from the collection and processing of the data to its                 
              interpretation culminating with both an oral and written report.               
              After the field segment the students return to their campuses where            
              the research continues provided the required supervision exists.               
              This is closely monitored by a SAGE faculty member and is augmented            
              by a visit to a SAGE faculty's campus and attendance at a                      
              scientific meeting.                                                            
                   SAGE is sponsored by Los Alamos National Laboratory and 5                 
              schools who furnish faculty and geophysical equipment.  Additional             
              equipment is provided by industry, e.g., ARCO and Kennecott, among             
              others, assisted SAGE in 1992.                                                 
                   This proposal seeks support for 13 undergraduate students to              
              attend the SAGE research program for each of the next three years.             
              Students are accepted from any school.  Strategies to recruit                  
              underrepresented students successfully brought four women, one                 
              Hispanic, and one Navajo to SAGE 1992 as part of the 13 REU                    
              students.
