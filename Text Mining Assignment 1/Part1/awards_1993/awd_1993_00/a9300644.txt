Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.  During the                
              tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Johnston and             
              his students will use the recently developed technique of                      
              photodissociation-photoionization mass spectrometry (PDPI/MS) to               
              investigate mechanisms of photochemical reactions of organic                   
              molecules in the gas phase.  In PDPI/MS, neutral molecules are                 
              photodissociated with an ultraviolet pulsed laser beam.  A second              
              pulsed laser generates coherent vacuum ultraviolet radiation which             
              then ionizes the parent molecules and neutral photoproducts from               
              the initial laser pulse.  The resulting ions are then detected                 
              with a quadrupole mass spectrometer.  The two primary goals of                 
              this research, which builds upon accomplishments of the Johnston               
              group under NSF grant CHE-9096266, are the (1) development of                  
              improved experimental methods for making innovative photochemical              
              measurements by PDPI/MS and (2) fundamental studies of mechanisms              
              of decomposition of large organic molecules.

              The successful attainment of the goals of this project will                    
              provide a rational framework for understanding how large organic               
              molecules undergo gas phase photofragmentation.  This knowledge                
              will facilitate the rapid and reliable determination of the                    
              structures of technologically important complex molecules.
