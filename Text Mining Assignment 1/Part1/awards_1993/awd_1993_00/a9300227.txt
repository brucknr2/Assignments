Abstract    :
              This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will                 
              provide for the purchase of needed laboratory and research supplies            
              that were lost or damaged during the passage of Hurricane ANDREW.              
              The $50,000 from the National Science Foundation is for immediately            
              available seed money to permit the university to acquire certain               
              necessary items of shared-use equipment and supplies to allow                  
              investigators to continue ongoing marine research projects and to              
              implement research that is directed at mitigating damage from major            
              storm damage in the future.
