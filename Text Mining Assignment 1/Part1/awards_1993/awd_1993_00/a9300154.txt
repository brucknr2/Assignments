Abstract    :
                  This project will bring eleven students to Utah State                      
              University for an eight week period in the summer of 1993 to work              
              on ongoing research projects in the Computer Science Department in             
              the area of parallel processing.  The program will combine formal              
              instruction in parallelism with the research work.  The major                  
              research topics which will be emphasized are partitioning programs             
              for parallel execution, optimization which combine fine grain                  
              parallelism with coarse grain parallelism, and fault tolerant                  
              software systems.
