Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral              
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of the relationship              
              between  working  conditions  and personality  development  among              
              informal  sector workers in Colombia.  Both surveys and intensive              
              interviews  will  be conducted in that country  to  test  whether              
              Melvin  Kohn's  theories  about the relationship  between  social              
              structure  and personality, developed and tested previously  only              
              in  advanced  industrialized societies, need to be modified  when              
              applied to the informal sector of a developing society.                        
                                                                                             
                    This  research will build upon a well-established tradition              
              of  research on the way in which the conditions in the  workplace              
              affect  the  values and personalities of employees.   By  testing              
              these ideas in a developing society, Colombia, this research will              
              contribute  to the effort to determine whether existing  theories              
              are  universal  or  can only be applied in a particular  kind  of              
              society.   In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved  by              
              the   research,  this  award  will  materially  assist  a  highly              
              promising   student  in  completing  research   for   the   Ph.D.              
              dissertation.   Thus  it  contributes to  the  future  scientific              
              manpower  of  the nation and the thorough training  of  the  next              
              generation of sociologists.
