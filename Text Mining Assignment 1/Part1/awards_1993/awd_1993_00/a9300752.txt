Abstract    :
              9300752  Friedlander       This award will support international collaborative
              research  of four investigators: S. Friedlander and M. Vishik from the  United
              States, and V. Oseledets and V. Yudovich from the Republic  of Russia.  The
              research involves magnetic field generation by  dynamos and stability and
              bifurcation in hydrodynamics.  The  project is funded jointly by the Division
              of Mathematical  Sciences and the Division of International Programs.  ***
