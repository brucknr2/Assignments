Abstract    :
              The Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Maine               
              will offer ten undergraduate students the opportunity to                       
              participate in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program.              
              Students will receive financial awards plus an appropriate                     
              subsistence allowance.  The available research projects include:               
              )1 Microwave Acoustic Solid State Sensors; 2) Robotics, Computer               
              Vision and Neural Processing; 3) Wideband Signal Processing                    
              Components for Communications Applications; 4) Motion Control; 5)              
              Microprocessor Instrumentation Applications; 6) Environmental Noise            
              Measurements; 7) VLSI Based Neuronal Models; and 8) Power Systems              
              Applications.  In addition to extensive university facilities,                 
              students will also have access to facilities at various nearby                 
              industries such as Bangor Hydro Electric and Central Maine Power               
              Companies, James River, Champion and Scott Paper Companies, Digital            
              Equipment Corporation and National Semiconductor.  At the program              
              culmination a written report and an oral seminar are required from             
              the student.
