Abstract    :
              9300091  Hickey  The Yale Peabody Museum houses an extensive collection of
              fossil plants of great historical and research value.  That collection was
              recently enhanced when Yale accepted two orphaned paleobotanical collections
              from the New York Botanical Garden and Princeton University.  This support will
              allow the preservation, housing and incorporation of the orphaned collections
              into the main collection, computerization in ARGUS  of the more than 42,000
              fossil plant specimens, dissemination of the database over Internet, and
              identification and segregation of the more than 4000 type specimens that are
              critical to research in paleobotany. Yale will  produce a type catalogue both
              in published and electronic form, the dissemination of which will increase the
              access to and research and educational use of these collections.  %%%  This
              award will support the preservation of two important, historical collections of
              fossil plants at Yale Peabody Museum recently orphaned by the New York
              Botanical Garden and Princeton University.  These collections, along with main
              Yale collection will be computerized, with the resultant database made freely
              available electronically and in print.  This activity will not only preserve an
              essential research resource in paleobotany, but will make this resource much
              more broadly available for research and education in the history of plant
              diversity.  ***                 "  @ !    pj  F     `z  QS  l  >t F 6 E U    Q
