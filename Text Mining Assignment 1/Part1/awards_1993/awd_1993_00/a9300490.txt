Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates                   
              (REU) Site proposal to provide research experiences for selected               
              undergraduates in marine sciences, with specific emphasis on                   
              studying how changes in land use within coastal watersheds affect              
              nutrient loading of ground water, nutrient transport by                        
              groundwater, microbial transformations and consequences for the                
              receiving coastal bay ecosystem. This experience will acquaint them            
              with the excitement and opportunities of academic research and                 
              encourage them to pursue graduates studies and a career in ocean               
              sciences.
