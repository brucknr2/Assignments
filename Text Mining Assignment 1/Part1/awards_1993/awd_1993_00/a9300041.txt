Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This REU Site Award is modelled after the successful site                      
              established in 1987 and carried on for five summers since then.                
              Over the next five years 75 students (15 per year) will be                     
              directly funded by the program.  Research is to involve                        
              principally materials science investigations including studies                 
              in:  Remote Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition; Thin Films              
              and Interfaces: X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Studies of Solids;               
              Near-field Optical Microscopy of Solid Surfaces; and Theoretical               
              Investigations of Macromolecules and Clusters.                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Programatic aspects of the REU site include:  broad recruitment                
              efforts particularly focussed on minority and women candidates;                
              weekly REU meetings and numerous social functions designed to                  
              stress the coherent programatic aspects of the site;                           
              encouragement of strong faculty-student interactions; development              
              of speaking and writing skills as an integral element of research              
              education; and regular evaluation at the conclusion of each                    
              summer's program
