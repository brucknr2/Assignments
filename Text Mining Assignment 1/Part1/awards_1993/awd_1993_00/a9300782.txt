Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of factors that have             
              shaped government policies toward women-related issues, focusing on            
              sociopolitical variables, the roles of women's organizations, and              
              the connection between feminization of poverty and gendered                    
              political activism.  The research will center on statistical                   
              analysis of data for the fifty American states, 1960-1990.                     
                                                                                             
                   This research will contribute to the political sociology of               
              social movements and government policy making, and to the knowledge            
              base concerning gender issues necessary for policy decisions.  In              
              addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,               
              this award will materially assist a highly promising student in                
              completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it                       
              contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the            
              thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
