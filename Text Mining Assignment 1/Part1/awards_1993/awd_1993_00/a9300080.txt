Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This grant provides funds to hold the third RIDGE Theoretical             
              Institute in the summer of 1993 to investigate "The physical,                  
              chemical, biological and geological interactions within the                    
              seafloor hydrothermal systems."  The institute will consist of a               
              four-day short cruise and a half-day field trip, followed by a                 
              three-day workshop.
