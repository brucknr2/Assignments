Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Undergraduate Neurosciences                   
              Program at Duke University to establish an NSF-REU site                        
              which will support a Summer Undergraduate Research                             
              initiative.  The program emphasizes integrative, systems,                      
              and behavioral neuroscience, reflecting the breadth of                         
              neuroscience research at Duke University.  Research, and                       
              training experiences will be organized around the theme of                     
              "mechanisms of behavior", capitalizing on the strengths of                     
              the present academic Undergraduate program and targeting                       
              laboratories in which supportive and stimulating research                      
              environments are found.  Duke University has a history of                      
              successful summer research programs, especially those that                     
              provide training experiences for women and minorities.  The                    
              mentors have drawn form this experience in developing the                      
              present program, and are able to make use of existing                          
              administrative structures both for recruiting candidates to                    
              the program and for providing the logistical support                           
              necessary for an engaging and stimulating research                             
              experience.
