Abstract    :
              Dr. Maria Clelia Milletti and other members of the Chemistry                   
              Department of Eastern Michigan University are being supported for              
              a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.             
              For the period 1993-5, eight undergraduate students will spend ten             
              weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research                    
              projects.  Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-                  
              analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A                  
              unique feature of this program is the aim that the students will               
              develop in maturity and capability for independent research, along             
              with learning new laboratory techniques and analytical skills.
