                       The long term objective of this project is to understand the molecular
              mechanisms that control secretion of hormones from cells in response to various
              types of stimulatory events.  These mechanisms, which are currently being
              uncovered by experimentalists, least to complex phenomena involving
              oscillations and waves that require the use of mathematical and computational
              analysis for their understanding.  Of particular interest are 1) the mechanisms
              controlling calcium oscillations and waves in secretory cells; 2)  the
              mechanism involved in agonist stimulation of G protein events, especially,
              control of ion channels in the pancreatic beta cell;  3)  the mechanisms
              underlying the 2 5 minute period calcium oscillations in insulin secretion from
              pancreatic  secreting cells that are under the control of glucose metabolism; 
              4)  the mechanisms involved in the control of electrical activity and calcium
              levels in anterior pituitary gonadotrophs;  and 5)  the mechanisms responsible
              for the 15 30 period oscillations in insulin secretion from pancreatic islets
              in vitro.  The method employed by the principal investigator involve the
              development and analysis of ordinary and partial differential equations
              corresponding to mechanisms uncovered by experiment.  Sufficient quantitative
              information regarding the rates of these five mechanisms is available to
              justify these calculations, which will continue to be interfaced closely with
              experimental work.  The computational work will be done on a parallel
              architecture platform.  This proposal is being jointly supported by the Cell
              Biology, the Computational Biology,  and the Applied Mathematics programs. ***
