Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Nebraska in the purchase of a gas chromatograph with a mass                    
              spectral detector (GC-MS).  This state-of-the-art bench top                    
              GC-MS is essential to meet current and future research needs of                
              the Chemistry Department, primarily in the synethic groups in                  
              the Department.  This instrument is essential for research in                  
              the department which includes the following areas:                             
                                                                                             
              1)  New catalytic transition metal mediated carbocyclizations,                 
              2)  Bioorganic approaches to novel therapeutic agents,                         
              (phosphate inhibitors, amino acid decarboxylase inhibitors, and                
              a chemoenzymatic approach to the (-)-podophyllotoxin),3)  New                  
              synthetic methods using highly active metals,                                  
              4)  Bioorganic and synthetic chemistry of hydroperoxides                       
              (steroselective dioxygenation of 1,4 dienes and synthesis of                   
              hydroperoxides),                                                               
              5)  Intramolecular ferromagnetic coupling in di- and                           
              trinitroxides,                                                                 
              6)  Theoretical and experimental physical organic chemistry                    
              (siloxane research and nitro and nitroso additions).                           
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The gas chromatograph with the mass spectral detector (GC-MS)                  
              allows one to separate a mixture of compounds and to measure                   
              the molecule weight of each of the individual compounds.  This                 
              information is one of the essential pieces of information                      
              needed in order to determine the molecular formula and/or the                  
              molecular structure of newly synthesized compounds.
