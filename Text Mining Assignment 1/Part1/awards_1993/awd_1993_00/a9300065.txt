Abstract    :
              9300065 FUERST      The introduction of Nile perch, Lates niloticus, into Lake
              Victoria in 1960 caused a catastrophic disruption of the lake's endemic fish
              community.  Over 300 species of haplochromine cichlids and other fishes were
              affected, with many species going extinct.  Attempts to ameliorate extinction
              processes in this aquatic community center upon restoration of the environment,
              accurate survey of surviving taxa, and capture and captive maintenance of a
              sample of the community.  To develop general strategies for preservation of
              endangered fish, we propose a study of genetic variability in several species
              of Lake Victoria cichlids.  The work will be conducted with the cooperation of
              fisheries biologists of the Uganda Freshwater Fisheries Research Organization. 
              Genetic variability in several species of Lake Victoria haplochromine cichlids
              will be characterized, and observed levels of genetic variation will be
              compared in species that: (a) have successfully adapted to environmental
              changes, (b) are endangered but for which adaptation is questionable.  A small
              set of molecular markers, including  randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
              markers and markers from the ribosomal RNA gene region, will be used in this
              study to estimate levels of genetic variability within populations.  %%%
              Results can potentially guide management strategies for preserving fish genetic
              variation, inform species conservation decisions, and contribute to assess ing
              the likelihood of successfully reintroducing captively managed endangered fish
              populations into nature. ***
