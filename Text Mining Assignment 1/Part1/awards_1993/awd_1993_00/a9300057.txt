Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental                   
              Sciences at the University of Virginia to continue a                           
              successful REU SITE.  The 10 week research program for                         
              undergraduates will teach basic principles of ecology, and                     
              the methods by which scientists increase our understanding                     
              of the natural world will be detailed. The program will be                     
              comprised of three phases: I--Two weeks of formal lectures                     
              detailing the scientific method, hypothesis testing and                        
              experimental design; II-- 6-1/2 weeks of data collection and                   
              experimentation; and III--1-1/2 weeks of data analysis,                        
              interpretation and communication of results. The goal is                       
              show students how to "do" science and then give them an                        
              opportunity to conduct original and independent field                          
              research. Students are sought from a diversity of                              
              backgrounds, interests and home institutions. The focus of                     
              the program will be on testing hypotheses related to plant-                    
              animal interactions and/or population dynamics--topics that                    
              are felt to have considerable basic/applied interest, and                      
              high heuristic value. Students will conduct research in a                      
              field-station setting at the Blandy Experimental Farm, a                       
              biological field station of the University of Virginia, and                    
              will be immersed in a community of 15-20 graduate/post-                        
              doctoral researchers. Field trips will focus on issues                         
              related to conservation; a weekly seminar series at the Farm                   
              will also add to the research experience. A bio-ethics                         
              component is also included in the program consisting of                        
              weekly lectures/discussions lead by Mr. David Bosco,                           
              Instructor of Philosophy and Religious Studies at James                        
              Madison University. Faculty wages, and fees for laboratory                     
              space and dorm rooms are contributed as cost share items.
