Abstract    :
                   This project will provide a summer's research experience for              
              six undergraduate geology majors.  Of the participants, two will               
              come from schools that are members of two consortia of which Furman            
              University is a member or from schools within the states of South              
              Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia.  All schools                  
              involved are smaller undergraduate schools with strong programs in             
              geology.  Senior personnel involved include faculty from the                   
              geology department at Furman University and research geologists at             
              the Savannah River Site, a nuclear research and production facility            
              run for the Department of Energy by the Westinghouse Savannah River            
              Company.  The participants will be involved in an intensive 8-week             
              research effort with three of the students located on the Furman               
              Campus and three others located at the Savannah River Site, Aiken,             
              S.C.  As the summer progresses, the students will be encouraged to             
              become increasingly more independent.  The goal of each effort will            
              be to produce valid verifiable results that will contribute to the             
              body of knowledge in geology.  The overall goal of the program will            
              be educating the students to understand the process of research and            
              instilling in them an excitement about the field of geological                 
              research that will encourage them to continue on to graduate study.
