Abstract    :
              9300217  Mukherjee    This research examines fundamental deformation mechanisms
              of  superplasticity in intermetallics with special emphasis on the role  of
              interfaces.  Superplasticity is the ability of some crystalline  materials to
              undergo large neck-free tensile strain at elevated  temperatures.  An important
              feature of superplasticity is the  phenomenon of grain boundary sliding.  This
              research explores the  influence of grain and phase interfaces on the
              superplasticity  process.  Areas of investigation include the role of
              cooperative  grain boundary migration, measurements of internal friction due to
               grain boundary sliding with correlations to mechanical testing  parameters,
              and effects of interfacial back stress on the rate  parameters in the
              constitutive equation for superplasticity.  %%%  This research is aimed at
              improved understanding of superplastic  behavior and addresses the application
              of this phenomenon to  intermetallic alloys.  The results are valuable to
              near-net shape  processing of materials and automated manufacturing.  ***
