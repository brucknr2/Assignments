Abstract    :
              9300739  Hunt  The goal of the research is to develop techniques to have outputs
               of multi input, multi output (MIMO) nonlinear systems follow  nonanalytic
              trajectories, which are formed by concatenating  analytic segments in time.  We
              consider a class of nonlinear  systems that are feedback equivalent to linear
              systems with  linear outputs.  This is full state linearization which is 
              different from input output linearization based on relative  degree unless the
              system has no zeros.  This research will  include design of regulators to
              handle modeling error{ and  disturbances.  ***
