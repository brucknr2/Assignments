Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The following research projects will be pursued: (1) Continued                 
              general exploration for examples where unimolecular photochemistry             
              in the unit cell of a crystal differs from that in solution, (2)               
              The search for more examples where two crystalline modifications               
              with different space groups differ in reactivity, (3) "Crystal                 
              Engineering" by use of patterned surfaces to effect nucleation of              
              different space group crystals, (4) Development of quantitative                
              methods correlating crystal reactivity with prediction, (5)                    
              "Spiderweb Photochemistry" of molecules entrapped in cross-linked              
              polymers, (6) The design of product-shaped cavities leading                    
              reactants to desired products (i.e., synthetic enzymes), (7) A                 
              study of chiral quenchers of achiral excited state reactants, (8)              
              Development of a molecular clock to determine triplet rates, (9)               
              Theoretical treatments of organic reactions, and (10) Development              
              of new photochemical concepts.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Howard E. Zimmerman at the University             
              of Wisconsin. Molecules will be excited with light to produce                  
              excited states where the resulting reactions will be studied in                
              detail. Included in this study will be: (1) experiments to uncover             
              new photochemical reactions, (2) new ways to control excited state             
              reactivity, (3) the development of new techniques in                           
              photochemistry. Some of the projects will envolve the use of                   
              crystal and polymer cavities to tailor photochemical reactions, the            
              use of specially designed molecules to time excited state                      
              processes, and the theoretical treatment of reactions of organic               
              molecules.
