Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Biology Department at                         
              Oregon State to continue a successful  10-week program                         
              (summers 1993, 1994, and 1995) that will provide 11                            
              undergraduates  in biological sciences with research                           
              experiences in ecosystem studies at the Andrews Experimental                   
              Forest. This experimental forest is the site for several                       
              interdisciplinary projects, including the NSF sponsored Long-                  
              Term Ecological Research Program. Students will learn and                      
              develop skills as they interact and work closely with                          
              scientists from several disciplines on individual projects                     
              within larger established research programs.                                   
                                                                                             
              To foster student development and monitor what careers they                    
              pursue after they complete the program, a 4-phase program is                   
              planned: an overview phase which explains integrated                           
              ecosystem studies, an apprenticeship phase to develop                          
              student skills, a personal research phase, and an evaluation                   
              and follow-up phase. According to their interests, students                    
              will join a collaborating scientist for the second and third                   
              phases. An REU leader (the PI) will coordinate the program,                    
              organize the overview phase, field trips, and seminars,                        
              integrating the students and collaborating scientists,                         
              facilitate students' progress toward independent scientific                    
              research, and monitor the evaluation and follow-up phase so                    
              that students can be tracked.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Students will be housed at the field station with other                        
              researchers, an arrangement that encourages after-hours                        
              discussions and helps break barriers between disciplines.                      
              The project will place promising students at a scenic                          
              research site with an interdisciplinary team of scientists                     
              to produce good science and develop an enthusiasm for                          
              biological research.
