Abstract    :
                   The large number of univariate distributions that have been               
              thoroughly studied sometimes have been developed for use in                    
              statistical analyses of data; other distributions arise from                   
              natural probabilistic or physical considerations, from                         
              statistical properties, or as limiting distributions.  Most of                 
              the well-known distributions arise in more than one way.                       
                   Although univariate distributions provide information about               
              individual measurements, they cannot facilitate studies of                     
              relationships between measurements.  In many situations in the                 
              physical, biological, and economic sciences, it is just these                  
              relationships that are of interest, for which multivariate                     
              distributions are required.                                                    
                   The goal of this proposal is to contribute to the                         
              understanding of multivariate versions of the well known                       
              univariate theory, with emphasis on life distributions.  This                  
              subject is particularly timely because recent increases in                     
              computational and computer graphics capabiliteies have made the                
              use of multivariate distributions much more broadly practical.                 
              Multivariate models are now particularly poorly understood in                  
              terms of underlying structures that unite many multivariate                    
              families into cohesive units.  Meaningful derivations of                       
              multivariate distributions can shed light on which models to use               
              in different applications.  A consequence of this research is                  
              that flexible models useful in describing multivariate data will               
              become available.
