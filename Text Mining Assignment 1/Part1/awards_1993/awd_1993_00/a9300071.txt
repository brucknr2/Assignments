Abstract    :
                    This project will bring eight students to the Loyola Campus.             
              They will be recruited from Loyola and several minority                        
              institutions in the New Orleans area.  Faculty members from the                
              minority institutions will also be involved.  The participants will            
              gain exposure to the state-of-the-art software engineering                     
              methodologies, and they will conduct research in the area of                   
              integrated systems that are based on multi-paradigm software                   
              design.  The students will spend six weeks at Loyola in the summer             
              of 1993, and then continue work during the school year with                    
              periodic research seminars held.
