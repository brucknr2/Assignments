Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support for the work of Dr. Gerard                  
              F. R. Parkin of the Chemistry Department, Columbia University,                 
              on main group metals.  Monomeric complexes containing                          
              poly(pyrazolyl)hydroboratate ligands will be prepared,                         
              including alkyl and hydride derivatives, carbonyl derivatives,                 
              subvalent derivatives, and terminal oxo, sulfido, and imido                    
              complexes.  Multiple bonding with heavy main group compounds                   
              will receive particular attention.  Attempts will be made to                   
              isolate structurally homologous complexes so that comparisons                  
              can be made between the reactions of particular metals.  Alkyl                 
              derivatives of members of Group 2 beyond beryllium will be                     
              characterized.  Synthesis of anionic copper(I) hydrides will be                
              be attempted, as well as that of new CO complexes of silver and                
              gold.  The reactivity of Zn, Cd, and Hg species will be                        
              compared to that of Group 2.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Main group metals are used as reagents in organic synthesis and                
              are important components of ceramic materials, semiconductors,                 
              and superconductors.  This work would provide fundamental                      
              information about the behavior of these metals, particularly                   
              the heavy members whose chemistry is less well known, and whose                
              usefulness in materials applications has not been fully                        
              exploited.
