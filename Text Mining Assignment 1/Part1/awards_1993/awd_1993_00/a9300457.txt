Abstract    :
              An "Engineering Research Experience for Undergraduates" (REU) Site             
              for ten women and minority students will be in the College of                  
              Engineering at Texas A&M University.  The REU program will be                  
              conducted in conjunction with an ongoing Undergraduate Summer                  
              Research Program, sponsored by the Texas Engineering Experiment                
              Station for the past ten years, and the Minority Engineering                   
              Program.  Students for the REU program will be selected from                   
              institutions that have predominantly minority enrollments including            
              the University of Texas at El Paso, University of Texas at San                 
              Antonio, University of Texas Pan American, University of Puerto                
              Rico, Trinity University, and Prairie View A&M University as well              
              as Texas A&M University, with at least half from other                         
              institutions.  Individual research projects will be undertaken by              
              the undergraduate students in conjunction with on-going research               
              programs, and regular faculty involved in these programs will serve            
              as advisors for the participants' research activities.
