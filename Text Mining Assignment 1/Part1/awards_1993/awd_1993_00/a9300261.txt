Abstract    :
              Dr. Daniel M. Downey and other members of the Chemistry Department             
              of James Madison University are being supported to continue a                  
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.               
              For the period 1993-5, eight undergraduate students will spend ten             
              weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research                    
              projects.  Projects range through the traditional areas of                     
              chemistry-analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and                         
              biochemistry.  A feature of this program is the intention to bring             
              in faculty from neighboring institutions with the aim to foster                
              research that will continue throughout the academic year to                    
              facilitate and strengthen regional interactions with this                      
              functioning as a regional REU site.
