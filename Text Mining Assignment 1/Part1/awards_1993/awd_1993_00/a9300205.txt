Abstract    :
                   This action will support the renewal of the REU Site in                   
              Physics at William and Mary College.  Approximately fifteen                    
              undergraduates, mostly from other colleges, will spend the                     
              summer in research activities that span a broad range of the                   
              physical sciences.  Participation by women and minority                        
              students will be particularly encouraged.
