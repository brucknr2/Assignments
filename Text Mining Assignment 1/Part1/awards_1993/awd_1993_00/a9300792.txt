Abstract    :
                   This project will study and classify the kinds of large-scale             
              restructuring of the global solar field which are related to                   
              Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).  CMEs involve large-scale                       
              restructuring of the corona and the ejection of large amounts of               
              mass and energy into the heliosphere.  However, we know very little            
              about how or where CMEs originate or how they develop, so it is                
              important to understand their relationship to the large-scale                  
              magnetic fields patterns near the solar surface and in the low                 
              corona.  We propose a two-part approach to this problem.  First, we            
              will study the source locations of Skylab and SMM CMEs determined              
              by mapping them onto synoptic maps for each solar rotation.  Such              
              maps are now available tracing the large-scale global magnetic                 
              fields from the photosphere, through the chromosphere, and into the            
              corona.  When stacked in time-series, such maps reveal large-scale             
              patters of convergence, divergence and shear of the fields.                    
              Second, the locations of these CMEs will be compared with white                
              light synoptic maps and daily coronagraphic images to determine the            
              relationship of CMEs to preexisting coronal streamers.  This                   
              project will enhance our understanding of the physics of solar                 
              activity, especially CMEs, of the structure and evolution of the               
              corona, and or the propagation of large-scale disturbances through             
              the heliosphere.
