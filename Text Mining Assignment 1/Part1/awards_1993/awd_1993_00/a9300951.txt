Abstract    :
              9300951  Fang       This project is concerned with the development of analytical
               and numerical techniques for the identification of parameters in  nonlinear
              partial differential equations which model  semiconductor devices. A particular
              focus is the quantitative  relationship between measurements collected by
              nondestructive  testing techniques and the desired model parameters. This 
              analysis will form the basis for the development of effective  numerical
              algorithms to be used for identification of parameters  directly from the
              measurements. It is anticipated that  such  algorithms will have an immediate
              impact on parameter estimation  in semiconductor devices.       In the
              semiconductor industry, there are newly developed  nondestructive testing
              techniques for detection of interior  properties of semiconductor devices that
              are not directly  measurable. The relation between the measurements collected
              by  such techniques and the desired interior property is not well  understood
              quantitatively. In this project, the quantitative  relationship between the
              quantity that describes the interior  property and the measurements obtained
              will be explored. Such an  analysis will allow the semiconductor industry to
              better  understand the practical aspects of nondestructive testing  techniques
              and hence provide information for improved estimation  of critical parameters
              in semiconductor devices. Based on this  analysis, computer programs will be
              developed that can be used to  compute the desired quantity directly from
              measured data.  ***
