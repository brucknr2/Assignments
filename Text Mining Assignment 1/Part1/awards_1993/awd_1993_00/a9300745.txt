Abstract    :
              This project will assess the feasibility of using liquid crystals              
              and infrared imaging in a novel application.  The project will                 
              develop and apply advanced instrumentation for the determination               
              of air temperature and flow fields from HVAC diffusers used in cold            
              air distribution systems.
