Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of institutional                 
              change and cultural production in the New York art world of the                
              1980s.  It will be carried out through interviews and examination              
              of existing documents at examples of three categories of                       
              establishments.  Results will be analyzed in terms of theories of              
              the modernizing thrust in the evolution of cultural institutions.              
                                                                                             
                   This research will contribute to the rapidly-growing field of             
              cultural sociology, providing data on a world center of culture-               
              production during a time of rapid social and economic change.  In              
              addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,               
              this award will materially assist a highly promising student in                
              completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it                       
              contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the            
              thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
