Abstract    :
              9300253  Henderson       The increasing demand for high-quality, diversified
              products  is requiring the design engineer to deliver new and better designs 
              faster and cheaper.  Central to this goal is the need to evaluate  the
              manufacturability of proposed design features during the design  process. 
              Although researchers have begun work in evaluation  designs, many important
              links between the design and manufacturing  process remain undeveloped.  This
              interdisciplinary research  addresses the following goals: (1) a feedback
              system that provides  designers with understandable redesign help based on
              manufacturing  considerations, (2) a legitimate, pragmatic way of converting a 
              design-related product model into an appropriate manufacturing-  related,
              feature-based model used for manufacturing evaluation, (3)  a parochial factory
              model and key knowledge-based assistants to  match features with factory
              capability, (4) algorithms for  forecasting the statistical process performance
              for proposed  product features and manufacturing processes, and (5) a 
              manufacturing evaluation methodology that incorporates statistical  process
              performance, time and cost.       This research improves the concurrent
              engineering environment  by providing fast, efficient help to the designer. 
              The system  evaluates a product for manufacturability and feed back information
               to the designer in terms of the original design variables that may  cause
              problems in cost and quality.
