Abstract    :
              Dr. Gregory L. Hillhouse and other members of the Chemistry                    
              Department of the University of Chicago are being supported to                 
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in               
              Chemistry.  For the period 1993-5, eight undergraduate students                
              will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of              
              research projects.  Projects cover the traditional areas of                    
              chemistry-inorganic, organic and physical.  A unique feature of                
              this program is targeting underrepresented groups from the midwest.
