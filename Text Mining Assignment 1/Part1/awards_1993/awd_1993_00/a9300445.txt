Abstract    :
              9300445  Isserman  This award provides funds to the Regional Research Institute
              at  West Virginia University for an REU Site which offers students a  research
              experience in geography and regional science.  The program  brings students
              from colleges with limited research opportunities  to the university for their
              junior years.  Each student works  closely with a faculty mentor from the
              Regional Research Institute  and experiences the entire research process from
              defining a topic  to presenting results.  Women and underrepresented minorities
              have  priority.  The program was developed and refined during a  successful
              three-year pilot project.     In the Fall semester, the students become
              familiar with their  substantive areas, learn research skills, begin to
              understand the  nature of inquiry and scholarly research, and prepare a
              research  proposal.  In the Spring semester, they work actively on their 
              research projects and prepare a draft report.  The Summer stage  varies; some
              students opt to work fulltime on ambitious extensions  of their research, while
              otheres revise their draft reports.  The  overall goal is to prepare a
              manuscript suitable for conference  presentation and journal publication.  A
              group seminar and numerous  other activities prepare the students to conduct
              research, provide  the opportunity for scholarly interaction, and encourage the
               students to attend graduate school.  As Undergraduate Research  Fellows, they
              are part of the University Honors Program, live in  the Honors dormitory, and
              participate in Honors classes and  activities.    This award contributes to the
              Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in
              science through active  undergraduate research experiences.  ***
