Abstract    :
              Dr. W. Todd Wipke and other members of the Chemistry Department of             
              University of California at Santa Cruz are being supported for a               
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.               
              For the period 1993-5, eleven undergraduate students will spend ten            
              weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research                    
              projects.  Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-                  
              inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature of            
              this program is the focus on women, minority and handicapped                   
              students.
