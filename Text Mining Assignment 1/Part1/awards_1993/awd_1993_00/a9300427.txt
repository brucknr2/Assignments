Abstract    :
                   Under this award, the principal investigator, Dr. Mak, will               
              undertake several investigations involving atmospheric dynamics.               
              The first area is related to cyclogenesis in the extratropics.  Dr.            
              Mak will look at what role spatial inhomogeneity of static                     
              stability plays in cyclone or storm development.  Motivated by                 
              observational studies which show, contrary to normal assumptions,              
              that static stability in the basic state is quite variable, Dr. Mak            
              will investigate this variability and its influence on stormtrack              
              dynamics using a simple atmospheric model.  Another topic to be                
              investigated is the temporal variability of the Hadley circulation             
              and the mechanisms involved.  Again, principally using a simple                
              model, he will explore the roles of temperature and moisture                   
              variations on the behavior of the Hadley cell.  Finally, as time               
              allows, the PI will continue research in which he applies a                    
              statistical technique know as dynamical-empirical orthogonal                   
              function analysis to global data sets for the purpose of                       
              understanding the processes responsible for intraseasonal                      
              variability.                                                                   
                   All of these studies will contribute to understanding the                 
              nature of the general circulation of the atmosphere.
