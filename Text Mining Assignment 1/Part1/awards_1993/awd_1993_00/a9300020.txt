Abstract    :
              This project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program addresses a number
              of important issues in surface chemistry.  During the tenure of this three-year
              continuing grant, Professor Weinberg and his students will utilize molecular
              beam scattering methods to examine the process of direct dissociative
              chemisorption. Radical beam sources will be used to simulate high pressure
              reaction conditions and the effects of electropositive promoters and
              electronegative poisons on the course of reactions on transition metal surfaces
              will be investigated.  Monte Carlo methods will be used to study kinetic phase
              transitions in reacting systems and oscillating surface reactions.
