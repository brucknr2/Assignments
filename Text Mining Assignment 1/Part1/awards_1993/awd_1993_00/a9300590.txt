Abstract    :
              The National Nanofabrication Facility (NNF) at Cornell University              
              is an interdisciplinary center, the primary role of which is to                
              provide resources and technical expertise to researchers in                    
              microstructures science, particularly in the areas of advanced                 
              lithographies, nanostructure physics, scanning tunneling microscopy            
              for fabrication and analysis, optoelectronic and electronic                    
              applications, microfabrication applications to biology, and related            
              areas.  NNF provides equipment, training, and expertise to leading             
              edge research in a "hands-on" environment where the user is                    
              responsible for the conduct of that research.  This orientation is             
              unique.  In keeping with this role, NNF is conducting a Research               
              Experiences for Undergraduates program over a ten week period.  In             
              some cases, NNF facilities are used for only a small, but crucial,             
              part of the fabrication or experimentation.  Most of the projects              
              would not be possible without NNF resources.  In all cases, the                
              attraction of NNF is the quality and open access to central                    
              advanced laboratory resources, and the ability to accomplish                   
              complex or unusual microfabrication in a routine way.
