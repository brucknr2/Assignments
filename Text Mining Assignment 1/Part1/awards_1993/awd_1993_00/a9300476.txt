Abstract    :
                   The Geology Departments of Bryn Mawr College, Bucknell                    
              University, Lafayette College, and Lehigh University have                      
              successfully formed a consortium fostering undergraduate geologic              
              research.  Important research opportunities in Pennsylvania and the            
              surrounding areas in subjects as diverse as tectonics and                      
              hydrogeology are being examined by undergraduates from the four                
              institutions as well as George Washington University.  The program             
              is designed to foster cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary               
              studies as students work closely with one or more faculty mentors.             
              The research activities fostered by the Consortium become part of              
              a year-long undergraduate research experience.  To fully comprehend            
              how a research problem is conceived and conducted, students                    
              generate a proposal, conduct field work, sampling, and/or                      
              laboratory studies as appropriate, and periodically report on their            
              research progress.  Ultimately they will formally present their                
              results to faculty and colleagues at a Consortium symposium.
