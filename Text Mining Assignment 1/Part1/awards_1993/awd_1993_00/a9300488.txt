Abstract    :
                   The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution will operate the              
              research vessels EDWIN LINK and SEWARD JOHNSON in 1993.  In                    
              addition they operate the submersible JOHNSON SEA-LINK and a                   
              Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV).  These systems are operated as                
              effective research platforms for a variety of NSF-sponsored                    
              research projects.                                                             
                   The research vessel EDWIN LINK will provide 30 days of ship               
              and submersible time in support of NSF programs in 1993.  No ship              
              time on the research vessel SEWARD JOHNSON is anticipated in 1993.
