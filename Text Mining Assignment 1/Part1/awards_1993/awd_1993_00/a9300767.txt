Abstract    :
                   An international workshop on the experimental and                         
              theoretical aspects of the physics associated with                             
              supersymmetry and related topics will be held at Northeastern                  
              University March 29 - April 1, 1993.  Supersymmetry relates                    
              elementary particles with different amounts of spin, and is                    
              potentially the answer to the puzzle of how different                          
              phenomena in particle physics can occur at such vastly                         
              different energy scales.  However, so far supersymmetry is                     
              just a conjecture, and discussion of its theoretical status                    
              and future tests will be very worthwhile.
