Abstract    :
              9300562  Purdy  This award will support a cooperative instrument development 
              program by scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,  Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography, and the University of Miami.  The primary
              objectives of the project are to develop an test broad-  band seismometers for
              deployment in the deep ocean. Such  instruments are necessary for studies of
              ocean crustal structure  and for global seismic studies of the earth's
              interior. These  instruments will be used too determine the optimum deployment 
              strategy for long-term seismic stations in the deep sea.   ***
