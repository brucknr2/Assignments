Abstract    :
              9300827 Makris Seismic response of buildings and bridges can be substantially
              improved when additional dissipative units (dampers) are used. The energy
              dissipation ability of most dampers is based on the shearing action of some
              viscous or viscoelastic fluid that they contain.  So far, it has been used
              mainly in a passive manner.  Herein it is proposed to combine the concepts of
              passive control with the benefits of active control, to produce an optimal, yet
              stable and reliable damping system.  This combination is feasible when the
              fluid within the dampers is replaced with electrorheological fluid. 
              Electrorheological (ER) fluids can quickly undergo a drastic change in their
              viscosity and dynamic shear modulus when an electric field is applied.  In this
              study it is proposed:  (1) To manufacture in laboratory stable
              electrorheological fluids, adequate for civil engineering applications.
              (Several of the existing ER fluids consist of particle suspensions within a
              dispersant phase.  After long inactive periods settling of the suspension
              occurs which results to loss of the fluid ER activity.  (2) To develop
              realistic phenomenological models for the rheological behavior of the developed
              ER fluid, which will be experimentally calibrated.  (3) To develop analytical
              and numerical tools to predict the damper response based on the constitutive
              models developed for the material behavior.  These tools will lead to realistic
              macroscopic force displacement models for the damper unit, and possibly to the
              design of optimal damper geometries.  (4) To extend and develop algorithms that
              will actively control the structural response by modifying the physical and
              mechanical properties of ER       h)          0*0*0*         fluid dampers for
              linear viscoelastic and nonlinear viscoplastic behavior.  (5) To experimentally
              verify the developed models and algorithms with shake table tests on simple
              model structures.  ***
