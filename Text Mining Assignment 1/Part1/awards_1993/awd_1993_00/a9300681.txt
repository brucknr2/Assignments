Abstract    :
                   The R/V BLUE FIN is used primarily to support research                    
              programs in biological, physical and chemical oceanography on the              
              S.E. Continental Shelf between Capes Hatteras and Canaveral.                   
              Biological studies include assessment of benthic communities,                  
              micro-/phyto-/and zooplankton communities and their interrelations             
              on near and offshore nutrients and recycling of nutrients in                   
              sediments.  Physical and geochemical studies are closely related to            
              these biological concerns.  Measurements of along and cross-shelf              
              circulation are used to assess the relative forcing of circulation             
              by the Gulf Stream, winds, pressure gradients and tides.  Current              
              meters, pressure sensors and hydrographic observations are used to             
              provide the necessary data.  The R/V BLUE Fin serves as a platform             
              for obtaining this data.
