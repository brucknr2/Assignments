              project will document the diversity, systematics and geographic distribution of
              the beetles of the Virgin Islands and will ultimately result in a specimen
              based electronic database and a taxon based illustrated  manual.  Both products
              will be based on new field collections and an inventory of existing collections
              in American and European museums. The collections will include standard
              specimen mounts as well DNA material for future biodiversity studies.  The
              manual will be used by scientists, land managers, agriculturalists, educators
              and conservationists.  %%% The Virgin Islands are quickly becoming urbanized,
              with concomitant loss of a significant percentage of its biodiversity. This two
              year project will document the diversity and geographic distribution of the
              beetles of the Virgin Islands.  The data will be kept in electronic database
              and will be published as an illustrated  manual for use by scientists, land
              managers, agriculturalists, educators and conservationists. ***       `     h
