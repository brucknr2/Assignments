Abstract    :
              Benthic studies in the northern Bering Sea indicate that the Gulf              
              of Anadyr cold pool, which has apparently shifted over the past                
              decade, has an important influence on benthic community                        
              structure. This research will integrate benthic studies of this                
              feature with a recently completed appraisal of the importance of               
              the nearby St. Lawrence island polynya on benthic communities.                 
              This appraisal indicated that there were significant differences               
              in benthic biomass, sediment respiration, tunicate cellulose                   
              oxygen-18 content, sediment lipid content, and bottom chlorophyll              
              values between nearshore benthic communities most directly                     
              affected by the polynya, compared to the offshore benthos. These               
              findings indicate that the presence of the open-water polynya in               
              the winter contributes to benthic productivity south of St.                    
              Lawrence island. This work also suggested, however, that the                   
              presence of the Gulf of Anadyr cold pool had an even more                      
              important physical influence; it appears to be associated with                 
              the most productive benthic communities (as measured by sediment               
              respiration and benthic biomass) in the northern Bering Sea. This              
              research will conduct detailed studies of the nearshore benthos                
              southwest of St. Lawrence Island and within the Gulf of Anadyr                 
              cold pool, with the goal of characterizing the influence of this               
              feature on ecosystem function in the Bering Sea benthos. Benthic               
              production is extremely important in the shallow Bering Sea, and               
              more detailed knowledge of its role will contribute significantly              
              to our understanding of the Arctic marine ecosystem.
