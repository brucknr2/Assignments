Abstract    :
              The Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Manufacturing                      
              Engineering at Syracuse University is establishing a Research                  
              Experiences for Undergraduates program focused on fluid dynamics,              
              including experimental, theoretical, and computational projects.               
              The program will be conducted during a 12 week period in the                   
              summer.  Six participants will be chosen, with at least four from              
              schools other than Syracuse University.  A strong commitment will              
              be made to recruit students from groups that have traditionally                
              been underrepresented in engineering.  Six faculty are involved in             
              the proposed work; their research expertise ranges from the                    
              generation of parallel algorithms for boundary layer calculations              
              to measurements in supersonic flows.  Before starting individual               
              projects each student will attend an intensive one week training               
              program that will address basic research techniques.  In addition              
              to one-on-one interaction with a faculty mentor, a complementary               
              program of activities is planned to enhance the professional                   
              development of each participant.  Among scheduled activities are               
              a workshop on professional writing, a discussion of ethics and                 
              professional responsibility, a lecture on public speaking, and                 
              presentations on the role of fluid dynamics research in industry               
              by invited speakers.  Participants also will prepare a written                 
              research proposal, a final written report and make oral                        
              presentations of proposed work and final results.
