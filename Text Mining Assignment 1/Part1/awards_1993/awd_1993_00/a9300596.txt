Abstract    :
              Dr. Martin R. Minelli and other members of the Chemistry Department            
              of Grinnell College are being supported to continue a Research                 
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the               
              period 1993-5, eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks               
              each summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                
              Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,                  
              inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature of            
              this program is that half of the participants will be selected from            
              non-doctoral public and private colleges within 250 miles of                   
              Grinnell.
