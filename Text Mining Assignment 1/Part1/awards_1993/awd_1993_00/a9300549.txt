Abstract    :
              A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site will be established             
              at the Mechanical Engineering Department at Tuskegee University.               
              Twelve minority engineering students at the end of their junior                
              year will be recruited to have the research experience each year.              
              The duration of the research activity for each student is expected             
              to be one academic year.  Each undergraduate student will be paired            
              with a graduate student in an on-going funded research program                 
              under the leadership of seven faculty mentors.  The funded research            
              areas are in composite materials, fatigue, fracture mechanics, non-            
              destructive evaluation, microgravity applications and control,                 
              electric propulsion and combustion.  Students participating in this            
              program will be required to register for a three credit hour                   
              Research course which will be used as a technical elective.                    
              Biweekly meetings during the regular semesters and weekly meetings             
              during the summer will provide the forum for progress reports and              
              exchange of information.
