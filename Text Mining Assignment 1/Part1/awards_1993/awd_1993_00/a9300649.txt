Abstract    :
              This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will be              
              used as seed money to provide an opportunity for a number of                   
              research scientists to have access to time-sensitive field data                
              following the major destruction of Hurricane ANDREW in south                   
              Florida.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Investigators from the University of Miami and Florida Atlantic                
              University, will initiate field work and research that are directed            
              at fundamental scientific issues relating to the impact of                     
              Hurricane ANDREW on the south Florida marine ecosystem.  Following             
              the initial field work and planning provided by this project,                  
              formal research proposals will be submitted through the normal                 
              peer-review process.  The timely initiation of this immediate field            
              research, will enhance these longer-term and larger-scale research             
              activities.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The tasks to be covered by this project include:                               
                 -  Sediment characterization   Dr. Harold Wanless                           
                 -  Sediment/organics characterization   Dr. Peter Swart                     
                 -  Mangrove effects characterization   Dr. Samuel Snedaker                  
                 -  Seagrass characterization   Peggy Fong                                   
                 -  Nutrients/coral reef characterization   Dr. Alina Szmant                 
                 -  Endangered turtle species effects   Dr. Peter Lutz                       
                 -  Exotic tree species distributions   Dr. Daniel Austin                    
                 -  Exotic fish species distributions  Dr. Walter Courtenay                  
                                                                                             
              In addition to these research tasks, the funding will help support             
              a special session on Hurricane ANDREW environmental consequences at            
              the Symposium on the Florida Keys Regional Ecosystem, being                    
              organized by RSMAS for mid-November 1992 in Miami.
