Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Maria Mitchell Observatory employs undergraduate students in               
              astronomical research in the topics of Galactic structure, Galactic            
              chemical evolution, stellar evolution, and variable stars.                     
              Projects take advantage of current observational data, including               
              the resources of the Maria Mitchell Observatory's photographic                 
              plate collection, and are generally related to the research                    
              interests and activities of scientists on the permanent staff and              
              visiting scientists supervising research.  Ongoing research will               
              focus on photometry of star clusters to determine the ages and the             
              morphology of cluster evolutionary sequences and medium and high               
              resolution spectroscopy of stars in both clusters and the Galactic             
              field to study the chemical structure and evolution of the Galactic            
              disk.  The research will also include investigations of variable               
              stars of particular current interest.  The 80 year time-line                   
              provided by the Observatory's plate collection will be used.  The              
              program may expand to include theoretical astrophysics and other               
              observational fields as the program diversifies.                               
                                                                                             
              The Observatory intends to bring six students to participate in the            
              REU program held in the summer and up to four students to carry out            
              research in the autumn.  Research projects are designed to                     
              introduce students to varied aspects of data reduction and                     
              analysis, using recently acquired as well as archival data, and to             
              involve students in all aspects of a research work.  The students              
              are encouraged to view the projects as their own independent work,             
              to take responsibility for all aspects of its execution and                    
              completion, and as a result, to obtain recognition through                     
              authorship of the scientific results.
