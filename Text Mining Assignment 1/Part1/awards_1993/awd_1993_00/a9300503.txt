Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  WEATHERBIRD II is a general purpose research vessel owned and             
              operated by the Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Inc.  The             
              1993 schedule for R/V WBII has a total of 151 operating days, of               
              which 144 are in support of NSF-funded research.  The scientific               
              cruises are scheduled to commence in early May, prior to that the              
              vessel will be in a US shipyard undergoing a major conversion and              
              refit.                                                                         
                                                                                             
                   Bermuda is the site of one of the two U.S. JGOFS funded time-             
              series stations, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS).                
              This program is scheduled for 55 days and is in the fifth year of              
              a five year program. There are sixteen research groups who will                
              conduct their research on an ancillary basis with the BATS program.            
              In addition to the BATS cruises the WBII will support the biweekly             
              Hydrostation S sampling program, which has been conducted for the              
              past 38 years.                                                                 
                                                                                             
                   The WBII is part of the UNOLS fleet that supports                         
              oceanographic research.  These vessels do not operate in the same              
              manner as general cargo or fishing vessels.  NSF supports the                  
              operation of a variety of these vessels specifically dedicated to              
              oceanographic research and operated by universities and research               
              institutes around the country.
