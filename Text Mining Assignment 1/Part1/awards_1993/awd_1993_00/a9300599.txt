Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to conduct piezocone                         
              penetration tests in the centrifuge on soil samples                            
              which are prepared to achieve certain strength and                             
              stiffness profiles. The results of cone penetration                            
              tests can be compared with the reference soil properties                       
              which are measured by conventional triaxial testing                            
              on specimens that are either prepared to the same                              
              conditions as the centrifuge soil sample, or are obtained by                   
              coring from the centrifuge sample after the penetration test.                  
              In addition, since the undrained shear strength of soil is                     
              not a unique parameter and depends on the type of test used                    
              to measure it, it will be adopted that the undrained shear                     
              strength measured by the shear vane will be used as the                        
              reference in this research. Thus, simultaneously with                          
              cone penetration tests on a centrifuge sample, the                             
              undrained shear strength profile of the sample will                            
              be measured by means of a miniature shear vane, so                             
              that the profiles of cone penetration resistance and                           
              of shear strength can be compared directly.
