Abstract    :
              Dr. Philip DeShong and other members of the Chemistry Department of            
              University of Maryland are being supported for a Research                      
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the               
              period 1993-5, eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks               
              each summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                
              Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,                  
              inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature of            
              this program is targeting of schools within a 200 hundred mile                 
              radius with special emphasis on women and minorities.
