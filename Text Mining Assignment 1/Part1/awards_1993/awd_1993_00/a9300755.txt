Abstract    :
              Dr. William H. Scouten and other members of the Chemistry                      
              Department of Baylor University are being supported to continue a              
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.               
              For the period 1993-5, twelve undergraduate students will spend ten            
              weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research                    
              projects.  Projects range the traditional areas of chemistry -                 
              analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry.  A                  
              unique feature of this program is the involvement of historically              
              black and hispanic campuses as well as predominately minority                  
              junior colleges.
