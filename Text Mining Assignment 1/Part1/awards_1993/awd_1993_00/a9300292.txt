Abstract    :
              Dr. Patricia A. Bianconi and other members of the Chemistry                    
              Department of Pennsylvania State University are being supported to             
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in               
              Chemistry.  For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students will             
              spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of                   
              research projects.  Projects cover the traditional and newer areas             
              of chemistry-analytical, bioorganic, biophysical, inorganic,                   
              organic, physical and materials.  A unique feature of this program             
              is a series of seminar programs designed to broaden their knowledge            
              of chemistry and chemical instrumentation both from a theoretical              
              and practical viewpoint.
