Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Regitze Vold will examine spin                      
              relaxation and molecular dynamics in solid and semisolid                       
              systems.  NMR pulse techniques, lineshape simulation programs,                 
              and relaxation theory developed under previous NSF funding                     
              will be extended and applied to molecular dynamic processes,                   
              including electron- and proton-transfer reactions.                             
              Paramagnetic inorganic and bioinorganic compounds relevant to                  
              the dynamics of electron transfer and spin-crossover processes                 
              will be studied with deuterium quadrupole echo and double                      
              quantum lineshapes.  The location, ordering, and dynamics of                   
              ubiquinone in oriented and unoriented membrane model systems                   
              will be determined, as well as the dynamics of trapped alkanes                 
              and carboxylic acids and amidines.

              The wide variety of experiments undertaken in this project                     
              will help explain how molecular and lattice dynamics in                        
              condensed phase materials affect phenomena in transition metal                 
              complexes, bimetallic compounds, metalloproteins, such as                      
              simple iron porphyrins, and the coenzyme ubiquinone.  These                    
              will help elucidate diverse mechanisms such as electron                        
              transfer between hemes, oxidative phosphorylation in inner                     
              mitochondrial membrane, and photosynthesis and the respiratory                 
              chain in mitochondria.
