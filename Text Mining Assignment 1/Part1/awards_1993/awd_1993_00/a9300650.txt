Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A three-day workshop will be held on the subject of coral-based                
              climate reconstruction.  Participants are to include scientists                
              engaged in paleoclimate studies using corals as well as specialists            
              from related disciplines.  The purpose of the workshop is: (1) to              
              discuss and evaluate methods for chronology development,                       
              paleoclimate time series, (2) to disseminate information about the             
              use and fidelity of new and existing paleoclimate tracers in                   
              corals, (3) to explore ways in which coral-based paleoclimatology              
              would benefit from methodologies and expertise developed in related            
              fields, (4) to develop strategies for coordinated studies, and (5)             
              to initiate discussion on development of a regional or global                  
              "scleroclimatic" database.
