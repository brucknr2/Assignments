Abstract    :
              9300976  Baer       Dr. Baer's previous results indicate that improved forecast 
              skill with atmospheric prediction models can be achieved with  appropriate
              distribution of model levels in the vertical.  The  initial studies were done
              with a model beginning with a basic state  with the atmosphere at rest.  While
              this approximation makes the  problem tractable numerically, it is not terribly
              realistic.  Under  this award, the PI will consider a model in which more
              realistic  assumptions and explore optimum grid distributions with respect to 
              latitude and height.  The results of this research should lead to  numerical
              representations for weather and climate prediction models  which are more
              efficient and accurate and remove significant  numerical truncation errors.
