Abstract    :
               The Principal Investigator proposes to study some variational problems on
              Riemann Surfaces that have applications  to the study of the Moduli space of
              curves and three dimensional hyperbolic geometry.  Specifically, he proposes to
              study an extremal length problem on a Riemann surface the solution of  which
              would lead to new invariants of Riemann surfaces, and then new local functions
              on Moduli space.  He also proposes to study  the shapes of images of harmonic
              maps of surfaces in hyperbolic three-manifolds, including the
              differential-topological singularities of the images, and the dependence of the
              motion of the image surface in the three-manifold upon the motion of the domain
              in Teichmuller space.
