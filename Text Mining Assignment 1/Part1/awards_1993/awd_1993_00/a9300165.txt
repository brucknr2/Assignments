Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a 3 year project to establish an REU              
              site at St Olaf College to involve undergraduates in ice-radar and             
              satellite remote-sensing studies of glaciers and ice sheets.  In               
              addition to on-going work on radar data obtained from field studies            
              of ice streams in West Antarctica and glaciers in Washington State,            
              this project will use radar and satellite imagery information to               
              help improve models of ice stream flow.   In addition to the                   
              laboratory work, the students involved in this project will                    
              participate in field work on the South Cascade Glacier, Washington.            
              This work is in collaboration with glaciologists at NASA-Goddard               
              and the University of Chicago at no cost to this grant.
