Abstract    :
              New models of lithosperic accretion at mid-ocean ridges views the  process as
              driven primarily by the nature of mantle flow beneath  the ridge axis and the
              variable thermal and mechanical properties  of the lithosphere forming along
              the ridge segment.  These models  make specific predictions about how crustal
              thickness should vary  along-axis and between segments with different gravity
              signatures.   The goal of this study is to test these predictions using a
              series  of seismic refraction experiments at three spreading segments 
              characterized by different amounts of magmatism and amagmatic  extension.
