Abstract    :
              9300446  Davis       This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing 
              award.  Conventional computer models of physical processes demand  precise
              mathematical accounts of the laws governing the domain and  precise numerical
              measurements of the particular system being  modelled.  Human reasoners, by
              contrast, can often come to useful  conclusions even when they have only a
              partial model of the  underlying physics or partial knowledge of the parameters
              of the  particular system.  It would be of great practical value and 
              theoretical interest to implement a computer system that could do  likewise. 
              Artificial intelligence work on qualitative physical  reasoning has obtained
              interesting but limited results in this  direction.  Building such systems of
              greater flexibility and power  will require an extensive study of the issues of
              representation and  inference that arise within physical reasoning.  This work
              will  concentrate primarily on formally characterizing a wide range of 
              physical domains and the perceptual and effectual interfaces  between robotics
              and physics; on developing useful representations  for qualitative spatial
              information and techniques for dealing with  this information; and on
              developing inference techniques that  support temporal reasoning over extended
              intervals.
