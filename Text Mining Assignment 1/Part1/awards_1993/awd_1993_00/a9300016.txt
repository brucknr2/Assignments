Abstract    :
              9300016  Jonckheere  The proposed research is aimed at achieving a deeper 
              understanding of the closed-loop (robust) stability issue in  feedback systems
              under uncertain parameters.  Three different  directions of attack of the
              problem, all inspired from algebraic  and differential topology, are proposed -
              the Simplicial  Approximation Theorem, The Morse Theory, and Obstruction
              Theory.    From there, new "simplicial" algorithms for computing the  stability
              boundary in the space of uncertainties emerge.  The  general feature of these
              algorithms is that they are based on the  idea of simplicial decomposition of
              the space of uncertainty.  A  byproduct of this approach is the elucidation of
              the topology of  the separating boundary, bounds on the Betti numbers of the 
              stability, and most importantly, its structural stability under  perturbation
              of the parameters that have been declared "certain."  ***
