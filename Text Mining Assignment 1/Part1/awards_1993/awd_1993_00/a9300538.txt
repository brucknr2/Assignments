Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                  
              Dissertation Research program.  It will support a study of the                 
              effects of social class locations on women's orientations to work,             
              employing a life-course perspective to analyze data from 90 semi-              
              structured interviews.  Two main questions will be investigated: 1.            
              Are there social class differences in women's subjective experience            
              of work?  2. To what extent can social class differences in                    
              subjective work experience be linked to social class differences in            
              women's objective experience of family, work and school?                       
                                                                                             
                   This research will contribute to the sociology of gender                  
              roles, social class, family, and occupational stratification.  In              
              addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,               
              this award will materially assist a highly promising student in                
              completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it                       
              contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the            
              thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
