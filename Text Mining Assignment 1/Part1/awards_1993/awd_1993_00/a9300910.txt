              project will complete the inventory of the plants of the Philippines.  In so
              doing, it will document the severe reduction in plant diversity in the
              Philippines since the beginning of this century    less the 6% (2300 sq. miles)
              of the original forests remain.  The project, originally based at the Bishop
              Museum in Hawaii, was recently transferred to the Botanical Research Institute
              of Texas and closely involves the Philippine National Herbarium, where the
              voucher collections of the survey are being housed and databased. The results
              of the project will enable investigators to identify similar trends in other
              tropical areas such as irreversible soil changes, loss of forest dependent
              species and cyclical changes in temperature and humidity.  Knowledge of these
              trends will aid in conservation efforts in the Philippines, where it has
              developed social, economic, cultural and political partnerships.  In addition
              to completing the survey of the entire country, teams of investigators will
              sample permanent plots to estimate the thoroughness of the survey methodology.
              %%% Since the beginning of this century, the Philippines has lost over 94% of
              its original forests to human activity.  This study will complete a long term
              survey of the remaining plants of the Philippines.  Its results will enable
              conservation efforts in the Philippines which the project has already aided
              through its social, economic, cultural and political partnerships.  One of the
              essential partners in this project is the Philippine National Herbarium, where
              the voucher collections of the survey are being housed and databased. ***
