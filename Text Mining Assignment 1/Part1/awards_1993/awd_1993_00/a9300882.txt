Abstract    :
              The Tenth International Conference on the Electronic Properties of             
              Two-Dimensional Systems (EP2DS-10) will be held in Newport, Rhode              
              Island from May 31-June 4, 1993.  This conference is the tenth in              
              a series and has the tradition of providing a forum for lively                 
              interaction and discussion with strong international participation.            
              The emphasis of EP2Ds-10 will be on the fundamental physics of the             
              electronic states and phenomena associated with reduced                        
              dimensionality (less than 3).  The conference proceedings will be              
              published in a special edition of Surface Science.                             
              The subject matter of the conference covers the following topical              
              areas:                                                                         
              *Nanostructures; quantum wires and dots; and mesoscopic effects                
              *Many-body interactions, collective effects, and Coulomb blockade;             
              optical spectroscopy of correlated states                                      
              *Semiconductor heterostructures, quantum wells, and superlattices;             
              III-V, IV, and II-VI materials                                                 
              *Integral and fractional Quantum Hall Effect and low dimensional               
              electron solids                                                                
              *Electrical transport in strained-layer heterostructures                       
              *Novel fabrication techniques                                                  
              *Electrons on helium and cryogenic solid surfaces                              
              *Low dimensional organic polymers
