Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to continue a seven-year old summer                
              program in solid-state chemistry for undergraduate students and                
              college faculty.  The concepts and techniques of solid-state                   
              chemistry will be examined for integration with the well-                      
              established and full curriculum of chemistry based upon molecular              
              concepts.  Selected students and teachers will be offered                      
              opportunities to interact with solid-state chemists from industry              
              and universities in a program of tutorials, site visits, and summer            
              research.  Participants will devote a nine-week period to research             
              on individual projects.  Results of these efforts will be presented            
              by each participant in a final symposium.
