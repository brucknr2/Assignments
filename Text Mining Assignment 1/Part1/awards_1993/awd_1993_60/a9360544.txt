Abstract    :
              9360544  Owen    If academic subjects are taught in isolation, students cannot 
              appreciate the development of and the relationships emanating from  the
              concepts that they are required to master.  Integration of  subjects or
              "integrated curricula" is a new pedagogical approach  that affords excellent
              platforms for research and a far better  educated populace than is to be found
              currently.  Presently,  however, most middle and secondary teachers have
              neither the time  nor the administrative support to enable them to teach a
              subject in  an integrated framework--one that may use the historical and 
              cultural context to show it development.  This Small Business  Innovation
              Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to investigate  the feasibility of
              developing a teacher assistant software design  for middle and secondary
              teachers of mathematics that uses concepts  and their contexts (cases) for
              case-based reasoning (CBR) for use  on Internet.    The project has the
              potential to contribute an effective and  accessible teaching aid for
              integrating curriculum.  This tool will  facilitate the maintainence of
              learners interest and the  development of a mental facility in students for
              linking concepts  and thus enlarging their problem solving capabilities.  ***
