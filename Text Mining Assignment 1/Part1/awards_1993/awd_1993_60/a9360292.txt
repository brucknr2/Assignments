Abstract    :
              9360292  Jain  A power plant simulator is designed using parallel computing 
              architecture. This new generation simulator integrates an  innovative tech
              technique for distributed computing. Traditional  simulators require excessive
              computing resources implemented in  uniprocessing environments at low computing
              speeds. In this  project plant models are created for implementation in
              parallel  processing architecture, and generating associated algorithms and 
              hardware architecture for parallel processing. The new generation  simulator,
              in addition to plant design analysis and personnel  training, is useful for
              many other applications, such as  configuring and evaluating procedures for
              plant operations under  transient conditions.  ***
