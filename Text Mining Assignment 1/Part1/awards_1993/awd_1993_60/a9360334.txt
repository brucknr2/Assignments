Abstract    :
              Lee  9360334        A critical deficiency in current dielectric materials that
              prevents their use in the next generations of ultra fast computing systems. 
              Organic polymers offer the most promise in this area and are already beginning
              to displace inorganic material such as silicon dioxide in these applications
              due to the performance advantages offered by organic systems.  New organic
              materials with the right combinations of properties are desired.   
              Polyquinolines of not have the deficiencies that plague polymides and
              polyquinolines are ideally suited to serve as dielectric materials due in part
              to their inherently low dielectric constants (2.6-2.8), low moisture uptakes
              (0.15%), and excellent thermal stability's.  In addition, a facile synthesis of
              polyquinolines has recently been developed at Maxdem which greatly simplifies
              their preparation and allows for the easy modification of their structure to
              yield new polyquinoline derivatives.  However, trial and error methods of
              preparing new derivatives are to time consuming and costly because of the
              complex interrelationships between polymer properties.  This will establish
              structure-property relationships essential to the development of optimum
              polyquinoline derivatives for electronic applications.  ***
