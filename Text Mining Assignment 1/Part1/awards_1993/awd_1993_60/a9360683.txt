Abstract    :
              9360683  Eraslan      MELTER-ISV Simulator will be developed as the
              industry-standard computational model for simulating in-situ vitrification
              (ISV) process that are currently being considered as alternative remedation
              technologies for hazard-waste sited.  The advanced state-of-the-art
              computational model will be able to simulate the transient, three-dimensional,
              chemically reacting, multi-constituent-material, multi-phase  solid, liquid,
              gas (vapor)  convection-flow and heat-transfer conditions in the melt and in
              the surrounding ground, during ISV processes.  Therefore, it will be able to
              predict, accurately, the detailed geometry of the molten ground-material, that
              can be generated during a site-specific ISV process, and consequently, whether
              or not, the planned site-specific remedial action program can actually
              stabilize and immobilize, by encapsulation, the contaminants at the
              hazardous-waste site.  MELTER-ISV Simulator will establish the urgently needed
              computational analysis capability  for the emerging ISV technology, which can
              be used by the regulatory agencies, in industry, in the engineering-design and
              planning of site-specific ISV systems, that can be implemented, costs
              effective, as remedial action programs for hazardous waste sites in the USA and
              around the world.  ***
