Abstract    :
              9360808  Buchan    Due to its unique properties and its ability t be processed
              analogously to silicon, silicon carbide (SiC) will be an important high
              temperature, high power and high frequency electronic material. The barrier to
              this developing technology was the availability of 6H0SiC substrates.  However,
              these substrates are now produced in ever-increasing quantities, and the new
              barrier is the quality of these substrates.  In Phase I, the defects in grown
              SiC will be characterized.  Synchrotron White Beam X-ray topography (SWBXT), an
              innovative and non-destructive technique in which local differences in
              diffracting power gives rise to image contrast, is uniquely suited for defect
              characterization in SiC.  The comprehensive and non-destructive nature of this
              technique makes it an optimal tool for research as well as for quality control
              in a production environment.  In Phase II, we will extend use of this technique
              from characterization of the grown bulk SiC to that of the wafer fabrication
              process, which will allow for the production of high quality SiC wafers in
              Phase III.  ***
