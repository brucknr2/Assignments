Abstract    :
              9360378  Tidwell  In an effort to reach higher powers,  laser researchers have
              developed  larger and increasingly complex   devices. An alternate scaling 
              approach is to combine the output  power of many simple low-power  lasers in an
               array. Microlasers are  the perfect array elements because  they are
              mass-producible and have  polarized, singlefrequency,  diffraction-limited
              outputs.  Aculight has developed a unique  microlaser array based on the desire
               for coherent operation. A coherent   array with N elements produces an  output
              beam that is N times more  powerful on a distant target or N  times  smaller at
              the focus of a  lens than an incoherent N-element  array. Since microlaser
              arrays can  easily contain several hundred  elements, the benefit of coherent 
              operation is great. Coherent  operation opens applications in   machining and
              processing of advanced  materials such as composites and  ceramics. It also
              enables  applications  requiring the output  wavelength to be converted to
              other  parts of the spectrum using  nonlinear optics. Coherent   operation is
              also the next step  toward electronic beam steering for  military and
              commercial  applications. These  opportunities  are possible only with the
              previous  development of the Aculight  mircolaser array hardware.  The
              objective of the proposed Phase  I program will be to demonstrate  coherent
              operation of the Aculight   microlaser array. We will fabricate  servo control
              electronics for the  array and integrate the circuitry  into the existing
              computer. We will  test the sensitivity of the laser to  variations in power,
              cooling, and  other variables to determine the  ultimate commercial
              feasibility. The  anticipated result is a compact,  scalable laser with high
              beam  quality and single-frequency output.
