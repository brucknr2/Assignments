Abstract    :
              9360783  Montanaro    This project will create a hybrid environment to provide
              the  advantages of both interpreted and compiled languages.  The  environment
              will provide a powerful, rapid application  development capability, and will
              provide a mechanism to easily  create C++ applications for parallel and
              distributed computing  architectures.  Additionally, the project will expand on
              the  growing number of C++ class libraries.    The project will develop a
              technology to support rapid  application development, and the creation of
              distributed and  parallel computer applications.  It will also include
              application  domain experts who are not C++ programmers.  ***
