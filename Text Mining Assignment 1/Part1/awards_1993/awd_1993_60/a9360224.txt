Abstract    :
              9360224  Bradley  HYPRES has demonstrated a 6-bit A/D capable of about 5 bits of
              resolution at 4GHz input bandwidth and about 4 bits of resolution at 7GHz input
              bandwidth.  The input bandwidth is about 10GHz (the 3db point).  However, the
              resolution at GHz frequencies has been limited by dynamic distortion in the
              thresholds proportional to the input signal slew rate.  A new comparator design
              has been simulated in which these distortions are largely cancelled by
              symmetry.    Simulations indicate an order of magnitude improvement in the
              aperture time of the A/D if the proper architecture is used (about 3 more bits
              of resolution at high frequencies).  In Phase I, HYPRES intends to fabricate
              and test this design of verify this level of performance at the single
              comparator level.  Phase II would cover design, fabrication and testing of the
              full 8-bit A/D.  ***
