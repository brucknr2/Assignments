Abstract    :
              9360318 Vaiman The Generalized Transient Energy Function Method for Power
              Systems can be used when network topology is changing. This Project is intended
              to develop methods for selection of optimal actions for Contingency Arming
              Schemes on an analytical basis instead of "cut and try" or sensitivity methods.
              We propose to develop theory, algorithms and programs for non linear models of
              Power Systems.  These algorithms permit to choose actions for Contingency
              Arming Schemes using the Generalized Transient Energy Function Method. 
              Utilities will benefit by:                increase of power system reliability;
                           decrease of electrical energy underproduction during             
              fault and post fault regimes;              selection of control actions
              depending on disturbance              strength in order to guarantee the
              transient stability              and the necessary transient performance ***
