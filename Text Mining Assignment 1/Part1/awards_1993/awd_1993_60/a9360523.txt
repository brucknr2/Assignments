Abstract    :
              9360523  Shtessel      Self-propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS) is a
              novel process for synthesizing intermetallic, micro and nano phase composites. 
              SHS powders can be consolidated via plasma spraying to high densities to
              produce high temperature structural or wear-resistant materials.  SiC
              reinforced MoSi2 intermetallics are of particular commercial.  Brittle MoSi2
              can be toughened through incorporation of dispersed phases.  Uniform,
              micro/nano dispersions of SiC, other carbides, nitrides or oxides, and other
              intermetallic/ceramic matrices can also be produced by SHS.  There is a growing
              need for materials which can extend component lifetimes and improve reliability
              in the increasingly severe high temperature environments of heat engines and
              materials processing (e.g. burners for glass production).    this research will
              evaluate the synergistic SHS production and plasma spray consolidation of SiC
              reinforced Mosi2 composites to understand process-structure relationships. 
              Processing relationships originating from SHS and plasma spray forming will be
              linked through microstructures and phase contents.  Research will establish SHS
              processing conditions which produce powders optimized to yield dense plasma
              spray deposits.  Evaluations will also explore the limitations of SHS on a
              commercial scale.    Success in the Mosi2/SiC system will be extrapolated in
              Phase II and Phase III to include Si3N and TiB2 reinforcements in MoSi2
              matrices.  Once processes are established, Exotherm Corporation will develop
              commercial partnerships to commercialize the SHS/Plasma Forming technology.
