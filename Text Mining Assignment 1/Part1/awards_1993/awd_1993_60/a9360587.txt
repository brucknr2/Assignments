Abstract    :
              9360587  Daughton    Spin valve materials have great application potential in
              Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM), tape or disk read heads and
              magnetic field sensors.  However, positive coupling between the two magnetic
              layers is always present in so-called "uncoupled" spin valve materials today
              and presents a roadblock for the widespread use of those materials.  this
              coupling reduces the effective anisotropy field for MRAM memory cells, reduces
              field sensitivity for sensors and may prevent "single domain" behavior in spin
              valve devices.  Positive coupling is believed to be caused by correlated
              roughness of the interfaces of the magnetic layers through a dipole-to-dipole
              coupling effect.  To obtain truly uncoupled spin valve materials, MER proposes
              a number of approaches o the spin valve materials using industry-standard
              equipment.  Some of the proposed approaches may also induce a beneficial
              antiferromagnetic exchange coupling.
