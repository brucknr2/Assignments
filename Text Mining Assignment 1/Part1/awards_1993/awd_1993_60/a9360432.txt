Abstract    :
              9360432  Harrison    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project  seeks to do the research necessary to bring into existence a  
              computer-assisted learning (CAL) tool to supplement classroom focus  on the
              relationship of variable manipulation to outcome, thus  making engineering
              problems and solutions "come alive."   Specifically, utilizing the opportunity
              presented by the  availability of hypertext and multimedia technologies, GRADE 
              Corporation proposes to research and develop (1) a set of databases  of Applied
              Mechanics problems, their solutions, and related  attributes; (2) a design for
              a user interface which will exploit  the "special attributes" of the databases;
              and (3) specifications  for using the databases in a client or server mode. 
              The research  will examine the feasibility of using a database of problems and 
              solutions with special attributes and classications to make a  highly reusable
              computer-assisted learning (CAL) module that is  efficient and appealing to
              students.    The research represents an attempt to stimulate the entry of 
              nontraditional students into engineering by assimilating vast  engineering
              problems and solutions resources into one readily  accessible knowledge base;
              at the same time, it invokes a concept  applicable to any student and to other
              subject areas with problem  solving objectives.  ***
