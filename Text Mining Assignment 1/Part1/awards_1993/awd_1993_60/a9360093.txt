Abstract    :
                    9360093  Peterson    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              I project  will develop software that enables a researcher to develop and 
              document a social data set.  The software will ease development by  automating
              those tasks that can best be done by computer.  It will  improve
              instrumentation and documentation by providing a structure  and format that are
              complete and of high quality.  It will also  eliminate much of the
              post-data-collection effort of documenting a  data set for public use.  The
              proposed software program would be a  significant resource for social
              scientists.  It would provide a  tool to assist the researcher with several
              steps in the research  process, including data set development, documentation,
              cleaning,  and analysis file creation.  Furthermore, it would integrate all 
              these steps in one program and provide a link to the archiving task  for those
              data sets that are to be placed in the public domain.    Successful completion
              of this research will lay the groundwork for  highly useful computer software
              tools of value not only to social  scientists but also to market researchers,
              government statistical  agencies, and others in applied fields that employ
              social data.  ***
