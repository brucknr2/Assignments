                   9360802 Furick This research will develop an integrated framework and
              software algorithms to seamless convert legacy paper blueprints into a
              knowledge based form of electronic objects.  These objects will hold the syntax
              and semantics contained in the blueprints.  The goal is a seamless transfer
              from paper to persistent electronic form that can be implemented by a
              practicing engineer who is not a computer expert.
