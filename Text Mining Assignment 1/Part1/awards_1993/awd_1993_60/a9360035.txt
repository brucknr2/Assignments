Abstract    :
              9360035  Daughton  A novel magnetic field sensing device is proposed which uses
              the magnetic stray field from a Neel wall in a soft (low coercivity) magnetic
              thin film to bias a Giant Magnetoresistence Ratio (GMR) sensor layer, thereby
              providing a high resistance change in the sensor layer with a low applied
              field.  Precise lithography (<0.5um) is required to etch the sensor layer to
              the proper width and to locate the sensor properly with respect to a domain
              wall in the soft layer.  Techniques to control the position of the domain wall
              will be explored.  A demonstration device will demonstrate the feasibility of
              the concept in Phase I, and it will show at least a 5% change in resistance for
              an applied field of 2 Oe or less.  This demonstration will also clearly show
              that 10% of higher magnetoresistance is feasible with less than one Oe of
              applied field.  ***
