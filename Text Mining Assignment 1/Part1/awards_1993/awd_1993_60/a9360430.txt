Abstract    :
              9360430  Williford    A new technology is proposed to adjust the velocity of
              sprays or  jets of solvent, in order to augment the ability of the resulted 
              droplets to transfer momentum to particulate contamination on  surfaces.
              Submicron contamination, otherwise difficult to remove is  emphasized.  Carbon
              dioxide sprays will be used in this research as  replacements for CFC solvent
              now being phased out of use.  In  addition to meeting environmental demands of
              the Clear Air Act of  1990, this replacement technology shows promise of
              improved  performance and operating economics.    The research has application
              to cleaning of silicon wafers and  semiconductors devices, other cleanroom
              components, hard drives and  information storage disks, drums for printing
              engines, and  photocopiers.  ***
