Abstract    :
              9360055  Sabri       This research addresses the human factors aspect of
              hospital   patient monitoring systems and seeks the means of improvements  
              through the application of ergonomics to the evaluation of   intensive care
              units (ICU's).  During Phase I, the intensive care   patient monitoring system
              will be reviewed and analyzed in terms of   human tasks and equipment
              monitoring functions and with respect to   the equipment setup process,
              calibration and initialization of   monitoring.  A functional analysis of the
              overall patient care   monitoring system will be performed to identify the
              needed   ergonomic design improvements.  These activities will be done in 
              collaboration with hospital doctors and nurses who operate the  equipment
              regularly.       Ergonomic problems that result in human errors or excessive 
              response time, whether in operating specific equipment or in  management of the
              hospital patient monitoring systems, will be  identified, classified, and
              prioritized.  Overall recommendations  regarding design changes and providing
              tools for human factor  reviews and improvements will be made.
