Abstract    :
              9360330  Korzhik        W.Peter Trower Inc. proposes to develop nuclear/particle
              detectors using new fast heavy inorganic scintillators provided to our
              specifications by our Belorussian collaborators.  These materials are of tow
              classes:    (1) bright cerium-activated crystals - YAP, GAO, and GSO - which
              could displace thallium doped sodium and cesium iodide in certain applications.
               Our current YAP crystals (up to 50 x 50 x 10 mm3) have measured efficiencies,
              resolutions, brightness, and mechanical properties comparable to, or better
              than, those of sodium iodide but are 10 times faster.    (2) dense undoped lead
              tungstenate crystals which offer an alternative to bismuth germanate.  Relative
              to BGO, our current PWO crystals ( up to 22 x 22 x 180 mm3) are 12% denser, 10
              times faster, and have 10 times better energy resolution but are only 10% as
              bright.
