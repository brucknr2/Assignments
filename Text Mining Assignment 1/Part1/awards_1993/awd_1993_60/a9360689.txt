Abstract    :
              9360689  Waight         The objective of this project is to improve the
              short-term  electrical load forecasts required for the efficient operation of 
              an electric utility by developing a technique to utilize a high  resolution
              atmospheric simulation model to generate information  about the variation of
              meteorological conditions over areas which  use a considerable amount of
              electrical energy (i.e. urban areas).   The current electrical load forecasting
              techniques utilize very low  resolution information generated by subjective
              modifications of  output from relatively coarse resolution operational forecast
               models.         The Phase I research is designed to determine the ability of 
              a high resolution atmospheric dynamical model to provide the  information about
              the variation of meteorological conditions over  an urban area that is
              necessary to explain a greater portion of the  weather-related variance in
              electrical usage that can be done by  current techniques.  The central
              hypothesis of the proposed  research is that the variations in temperature
              associated with the  urban heat island should have a large impact on energy use
              and  electrical loads in large urban areas, which is unaccounted for by 
              current short-term load forecasting methods.  The PIs propose a  technique for
              simulating urban areas at high spatial resolution  which will be able to
              objectively predict the distribution of  atmospheric variables in an urban
              area, correctly determining the  magnitude of urban effects and quantitatively
              relating them to  energy use in a way which is operationally useful to electric
               utilities.  ***
