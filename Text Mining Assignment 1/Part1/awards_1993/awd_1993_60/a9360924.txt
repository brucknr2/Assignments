Abstract    :
              9360924  Yadav    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in
              the general area of synthetic  organic chemistry. The objective of the research
              is the demonstration of a new process for the  low cost synthesis of
              fullerenes. Fullerenes are currently made by separation and purification of 
              soot produced in a carbon arc. The inherent high cost of this process has made
              fullerenes  inaccessible to commercial production and application. The Phase I
              SBIR research will  demonstrate advanced concepts for generation, either by
              arcjet or flame, of carbon vapor and  supersonic expansion quenching of carbon
              atoms derived from low cost precursors such as  natural gas, petroleum
              byproducts and/or biomass to produce fullerene structures of controlled 
              molecular weight.  %%%  Demonstration of feasibility of producing low cost
              fullerenes by unique quenching of carbon  vapors will create commercialization
              opportunities for their application diverse areas such as  diamond nucleation,
              optics, electronics, and pharmaceuticals.  ***
