Abstract    :
              9360161  Sun    A number of industrial processes, including incinerators and 
              metallurgical processes, typically emit large numbers of fine  particles. 
              Measurements at an operating sewage sludge incinerator  have shown that heavy
              metals (including Cadmium, Chromium, Nickel,  Lead, and Zinc) are concentrated
              in the fine particle  (approximately 0.25 mocrons) leaving the incinerators. 
              Venturi  scrubbers have been typically installed to remove particulate from 
              these flue gas sources.  The classical scrubbers are not capable of  removing
              particles smaller than about 0.5 microns.  The process  proposed in this
              project is the use of the submicron particulate  penetrating the Venturi
              scrubber as condensation nuclei for steam  injected into the flue gas to
              supersaturate it with water vapor.   Theoretical analyses show that water
              droplets as large as 1.0  micron can be produced with reasonable steam rates
              and contact  times.  These water droplets (a dilute suspension of the fine 
              particulate) are removed from the  flue gas stream with a high  efficiency mist
              eliminator and drained to the scrubber sump.   Preliminary analyses have shown
              that heavy metals in the fine  particulate leaving the Venturi scrubber can be
              reduced by 90%  using this process.    With a relatively modest construction
              effort, the process proposed  here can reduce fine particle and heavy metal
              emissions from  incinerators equipped with wet scrubbers.  The process is 
              applicable to flue gas streams cleaned by wet scrubbers including 
              incinerators, metallurgical processes, and coal-fired power plants  with wet
              scrubbers for sulfur dioxide emission control.  ***
