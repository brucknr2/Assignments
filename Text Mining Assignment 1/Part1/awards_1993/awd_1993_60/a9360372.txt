Abstract    :
              9360372  Sofge    Fiber/resin composite fabrication technologies new can produce
              high-strength, low weight structural components, while fiber-optic sensing
              technology provides a means for sensing various structural properties such as
              stress, strain, and elasticity when these sensors are mounted on, or embedded
              within, a material structure.  Composite structures may degrade due to improper
              manufacture, hysteretic wear, impacts and corrosion.  While embedded sensors
              provide a means for gathering vast quantities of data relating to the
              structural and dynamic history of composite structures, it is necessary to
              process, itegrate, and interpret this information if the embedded sensors are
              to be useful in determining structural integrity, using methods that can deal
              with the distributed and nonlinear nature of the problem.    This research will
              utilize advance neural network based techniques for modeling and analyzing
              dynamic structural information, as well as neural network classifiers for
              performing real-time sensor interpretation.  This will yield an intelligent
              system for processing , integrating, and interpreting embedded sensor data to
              give a real-time, robust, accurate measure of structural integrity for
              thick-section composite structures.  This project involves cooperation with
              McDonnell Douglas based on earlier work with them in the area of embedded
              sensor signal processing and neural network based classification for composite
              structures.  ***
