Abstract    :
              9360677  Lin       The nonlinearity and uncertainty inherent in a complex 
              dynamic system have been a great challenge to the autopilot  design that is
              required to have satisfactory performance for  all flight conditions in
              probable engagements.  Several  advanced robust nonlinear approaches, namely,
              inversion-  based control laws, analytical gain scheduling, and  nonlinear
              servo-regulator are proposed to design a high  performance autopilot.  The
              unique features of these  approaches include that (1) they incorporate the
              nonlinear  dynamics due to severe kinematic and inertial coupling as  well as
              aerodynamics into the design process; (2) they  furnish robust scheme to
              account for model uncertainties due  to aerodynamics and bending motion, etc.;
              and (3) they  provide adaptive mechanism to handle parameter variations of  the
              mass and inertia, etc.  Each of these features  works to  enhance the
              performance of complex dynamic system.  The  deliverables include a
              comprehensive nonlinear  design/analysis tool together with detailed
              documentations  and training courses.
