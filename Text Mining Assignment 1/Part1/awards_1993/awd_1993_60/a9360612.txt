Abstract    :
              9360612  LaConti    This is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation 
              Research Solicitation.  A low-cost, efficient, stable composite  steel anode
              structure is explored that should be especially useful  in synthetic
              electroorganic processes where system selectivity is  a major concern and anode
              deterioration affects product quality and  yield.  A composite electrode
              structure consisting of an impervious  and stable base-metal oxide coating on
              steel should be very stable  and should also have enhanced electrocatalytic
              activity for oxygen  evolution.  In this effort, selections of materials and
              deposition  parameters for the composite anode are addressed.    In the
              commercial electrohydrodimerization process for production  of adiponitrile
              (precursor to nylon), corrosion of the presently  used mild steel anodes
              results in unwanted side products and  parasitic hydrogen production at the
              cathode, thus decreasing yield  and increasing power consumption.  This product
              is designed to  correct this deficiency.  It should also be applicable in other
               electrochemical organic syntheses.
