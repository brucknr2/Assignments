Abstract    :
              9360764  Zachary       Computerization of work, particularly information-based
              work  which has been traditionally performed by manual methods, has  created
              many problems for new computer users.  As computer systems  grow more complex,
              their human users have increasingly difficulty  in successfully or efficiently
              applying the underlying system  functionality.  Research has begun to focus on
              using the human-  computer interface to solve such problems by creating
              components of  the user interface, called `agents' or `interface agents', that 
              cooperatively support the human in a variety of ways.  To date,  however, these
              interface agents have been the custom-built products  of individual research or
              system-development efforts.  For the  concept and benefit of interface agents
              to reach its broader  potential, more powerful tools are needed for their
              development and  maintenance.  This research proposes to assess the feasibility
              of  creating such a Generator of INterface Agents (GINA).  The proposed  tool
              is developed around an interface agent-building methodology  called COGNET,
              that was created, successfully applied and  behaviorally validated by the
              Principal Investigator in prior  research.  The proposed research develops and
              analyzes a detailed  GINA architecture, then implements and tests a skeletal
              version of  the underlying agent-execution engine.
