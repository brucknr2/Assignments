Abstract    :
              9360853  Koerber    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project  seeks to take full advantage of an educationally sound computer- 
              based technology to build a MathMastery system based on the idea  that mastery
              of mathematical concepts is cumulative--that mastering  these concepts in
              sequence is essential to building a sound  foundation enabling the learning of
              higher mathematics.  For a  mathematical educational system to be comprehensive
              for all grade  and ability levels and span all curricular areas of a particular
               subject, there must be an understanding of how each concept is  linked to
              others and how each concept builds on the previous ones.   Erko Technologies
              proposes to build a such a system which is also  responsive to individual
              learning styles and permits interactive  learning.     In Phase I of the
              MathMastery project, Erko Technologies will test  the feasibility of the
              construction of a comprehensive Mathematical  Concept Network that maps the
              interdependencies of mathematical  skills necessary for students in elementary
              and high school to  master, and the firm will test the importance and
              usefulness of the  Mathematical Concept Network as a component of mathematical 
              educational software.  If successful, the project will contribute  to the
              development of new educationally sound technology to help  more students excel
              in mathematics and develop the necessary  capability to pursue advanced study
              of mathematics and science.  ***
