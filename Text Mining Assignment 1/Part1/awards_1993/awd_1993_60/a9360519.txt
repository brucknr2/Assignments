Abstract    :
              9360519  Ryding   Insitu wafer analysis is proposed in order to examine metallic
              contamination in SIMOX silicon-on-insulator substrates during the early
              implantation stage of their fabrication.  Early detection of any metallics in
              the active silicon layer would greatly improve chances for impurity source
              tracking and ultimate cost reduction.  In Phase I, we propose to design and
              fabricate an in-situ, non-destructive impurity detection capability at the ion
              implantation station of SIMOX fabrication.  Several design advantages are
              incorporated which enhance detection sensitivity and ease of implementation. 
              Phase II is proposed to transfer the in-situ apparatus onto the production
              implant machine, incorporating design modifications or required refinements. 
              In-situ, non-destructive testing of manufactured material and ion beam control
              optimization based on the detection and feedback will ensue.  Phase III is the
              commercialization of the probe station as a product for high energy higher
              current implantation stations, consistent with IBIS products.  The nation may
              expect to benefit from the development of an in-situ, non-destructive wafer
              contamination detection system.  Such early stage detection may be used as an
              advanced quality control tool which will enhance product development and
              material for the silicon industry.  ***   v       s  t
