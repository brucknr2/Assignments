Abstract    :
              Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Field Programmable  Interconnect
              Devices (FPIDs) allow the integration of thousands of  logic gates on a small
              board and completely rearrange their  interconnections rapidly for different
              applications.  A major  obstacle to using such reconfigurable systems is the
              lack of  software tools to aid in designing applications to run on the  system
              forcing the designers to manually partition their design to  match the
              architecture of a particular reconfigurable system.  This  project aims at
              modifying the Anyboard design environment to  support many types of FPGAs and
              FPIDs.  Additionally the basic  algorithm to partition the design will be
              redesigned with a faster  and more sophisticated version.  The design tools
              developed by X  Engineering Software Services Corporation would aid digital 
              designers to experiment with alternate designs using different  types of FPGAs
              and FPIDs.
