Abstract    :
              9360860  Miller      The recent availability of the carbon icosohedral
              molecules, the fullerenes, and the discovery of superconductivity in alkali
              doped fullerene derivatives opens anew avenues of investigation into
              superconducting devices.  In particular, the fullerides are predicted to
              achieve high performance as superconducting bolometers.  Most of the current
              superconducting infrared sensors have utilized bolometric mechanisms, including
              most of those developed recently from the high-T ceramics.  The bolometric
              mechanisms are well understood, and a simple thermal model adequately predicts
              there bolometric behavior. Using that model the fullerence based
              superconductors are predicted to achieve a one to two order of magnitude
              improvement in responsivity (change of signal for a given change in power) in
              comparison to the superconducting ceramics.  Additionally, the same intrinsic
              physical properties of the fullerenes predict a reduction of the
              Noise-Equivalent-Power (NEP) by an order of magnitude as well.  the 
              combination of benefits can yield a three order of magnitude improvement in the
              specific detectivity, D.  In the Phase I project, Sigma proposes to test the IR
              responsivity of fulleride films using environmentally protecting test cells in
              preparation for commercial devices and arrays.  ***
