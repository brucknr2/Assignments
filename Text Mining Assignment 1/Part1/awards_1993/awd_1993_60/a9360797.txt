Abstract    :
              9360797  Minze       This project is to develop an Automatic Tool Trajectory 
              assessment and Correction System for use during process development  and
              process monitoring of Computer Numerical Control machine tools.   The system
              will directly measure the spatial coordinates of the  dynamic tool path
              embodied in a particular part program for  comparison with the desired path
              coordinates.  An off-line  processor will automatically create a modified
              part-program to  correct the path errors and download it to the machine
              controller.   The instantaneous tool coordinates along the path are obtained by
               simultaneous readings of three laser ball bars and trilateration.      
              Successful development of the system will allow for  significant reductions in
              the amount of time needed to develop  verified part programs from design data. 
              Other benefits of the  system include rapid recovery from machine "crashes",
              ability to  perform statistical process control in a much more scientific 
              manner, and rapid diagnostics for machine maintenance purposes.  
              Implementation of this technology will allow for significant  improvements in
              the process accuracy of commodity-grade as well as  special purpose machine
              tools.
