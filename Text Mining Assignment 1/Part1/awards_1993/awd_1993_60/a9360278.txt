Abstract    :
              9360278  Ebert    Under law, all 50 U.S. states maintain an historical
              preservation  office which records information on significant archaeological
              and  historical sites within the state. The data themselves and their  method
              of recording vary and no standard system exists. Most states  now wish to
              utilize geographic information systems (GIS) both for  storage and data
              analysis but almost none have actually begun such  work. Ebert and Associates
              will conduct a multistate survey. They  will determine the nature of data bases
              and perceived user needs.  They will then design a system which will be useable
              nationwide.  The result will both allow individual states to save a great deal 
              of effort, provide users easy access and ensure compatibility  across states.
              The potential benefits are great.
