Abstract    :
              9360873  Karam    We propose to demonstrate Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE) of
              GaN/A1N structures at growth rates exceeding 1 micron/hr in an innovative
              reactor which emoloys continuously flowing, yet spatially separate gas streams
              and a moving substrate to expose the wafer surface to alternating fluxes of
              Group III and V reactants.  The reactor incorporates both structural and gas
              curtain barriers to ensure fast and efficient removal o the excess reactants
              and reaction  products which limit ALE growth rates.  Their removal is achieved
              by coupling mechanical boundary layer shearing with hydrogen purging to prevent
              gas-phase mixing of the two reactant species.  In this way a process which
              combines the superior thickness and compositional uniformity of ALE with the
              high growth rate of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) can be
              achieved.    To show feasibility, in Phase I we will use ALE-grown material to
              fabricate a functional photoconductive UV detector; in Phase II, growth
              conditions and detector fabrication processes will be optimized.  One proper
              control of dopants is demonstrated, high growth rate ALE will be explored as a
              means of producing P-N junction devices such as lasers, light emitting diodes,
              and photodiodes.  The excellent uniformity of material grown by ALE will also
              make possible the realization of two-dimensional staring UV detector arrays.
