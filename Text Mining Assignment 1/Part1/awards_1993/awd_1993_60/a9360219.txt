Abstract    :
              9360219  Powell  Novel probes are proposed for the study of cytoskeletal
              structures  and processes by electron microscopy.  These will comprise large 
              cluster complexes of gold, platinum and palladium 0.8 nm - 2.4 nm  in diameter
              covalently lined to phalloidin, cytochalasin B,  colchicin and taxol via a
              single reactive functional group  incorporated into their ligand spheres.  The
              proposed conjugates  will penetrate 20-30 u or more into cell sections and
              achieve  significantly higher resolution than colloidal gold=antibody 
              conjugates.  They will be microinjectable and compatible with  living cells,
              and will be used to extend the use of electron  microscopy to the study of
              organisms such as procaryotic bacteria,  in which antibody probes are not
              feasible.  Combined labels  including both a gold cluster and a fluorescent
              moiety will be used  to prepare additional probes with the same molecules,
              enabling  correlation of fluorescence confocal microscopy and electron 
              microscopy data from a single labeling experiment.  The preparation  of
              molecular wires will be attempted by the in vitro assembly of  gold-labeled
              cytoskeletal components, followed by silver  enhancement.  %%%  A new class of
              probes for cystoskeletal structures and processes,  compatible with living
              cells, will permit electron microscopy with  higher resolution than antibody
              probes.  In vitro assembly of  labeled cytoskeletal components will be used to
              prepare novel  conductive molecular wires, and may be applied to the
              fabrication  of other molecular devices, catalysts, new materials and novel 
              molecular detection systems.  ***
