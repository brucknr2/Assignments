Abstract    :
              9360681  Graf    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project 
              seeks to explore the feasibility of using biological materials  which have not
              been traditionally utilized in educational settings  for developing new
              problem-based laboratory experiments in the life  science curricula.  The
              research will explore the use of plant  biological materials, such as plant
              mutants, which are available  through genetic stock centers and germplasm
              collections, to  construct classroom experiments for biology courses.  These 
              experiments are intended to encourage problem-based experimental  activities
              for communicating biological concepts for helping  students develop critical
              thinking and investigation skills.  In  Phase I, the experiments will focus on
              biological concepts which  will provide a foundation upon which students can
              build to achieve  a full appreciation and understanding of the agricultural 
              applications of modern biotechnology.  The use of these materials  will present
              students with an introduction to genetics and  biotechnology, showing the
              connection between these disciplines and  other areas of modern biology.   A
              preliminary evaluation component  focusing on obtaining feedback from several
              practicing science  educations of the project will be initiated.  It is
              anticipated  that the results of this Phase I will lead to the identification 
              and utilization of new resources in science education and will  contribute
              novel aspects to future improvements in the development  of new biology
              curricula.     Recognizing that very few laboratory-based curricula materials
              have  been developed in the area of biotechnology education as it relates  to
              agriculture, specifically plants, and that this area will have  increasing
              importance and relevance for students, Edvotek seeks to  make an important
              contribution to the appreciation of current  biotechnology research being
              conducted for agricultural  applications by providing such curricula materials
              on the grounds  that this area will have in creasing importance and relevant
              for  students.  ***
