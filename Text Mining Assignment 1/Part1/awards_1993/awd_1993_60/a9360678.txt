Abstract    :
              9360678  Cooper    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project  will test and evaluate the use of interactive media:  computer, 
              textual, and hands-on materials that illustrate professional  activities in an
              engaging "adventure" format in order to stimulate  awareness and interest in
              science and math-based careers and to  inform students about professions in
              science and engineering.  The  project pays special attention to
              underrepresented minorities and  girls in grades 3 to 5, including appropriate
              role-models and  special program information.  Specifically, a CD-ROM computer 
              program will use interactive graphics, animation, sound effects,  voice, and
              other techniques to allow young people to assume the  role of scientists and
              engineers, conducting simple experiments and  designing systems interactively,
              supplemented by hands-on activity.    Students will be shown how their school
              subjects relate to  professional activities.  The educational product of this
              project  will be a computer-based motivational and instructional tool for 
              commercial sale to school districts, to be used in science and  mathematics
              curricula.  ***
