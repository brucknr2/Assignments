Abstract    :
              9360932  Black  Intelligent Fiber Optic systems provide a new sensing approach
              for  smart structure applications.  This integrated structure exploits  novel
              combination of mutually compatible and complementary known  technologies: (a)
              dual-mode fibers, (b) fiber Bragg gratings, and  (c) lattice sensor arrays. 
              Both broadband and tunable narrowband  optical sources are applicable.  a
              two-sensor array prototype will  be constructed and evaluated for sensitivity,
              dynamic range,  linearity, reliability and installation options.
