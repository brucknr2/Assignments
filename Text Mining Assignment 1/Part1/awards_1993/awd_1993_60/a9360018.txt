Abstract    :
              9360018  Zamansky    This is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation
               Research Solicitation.  It is a novel approach to the control of  nitrogen
              oxides from combustion flue gases based upon the oxidation  of nitric oxide
              (NO) to nitrogen dioxide, and removal of the latter  in slightly modified
              calcium-based sulfur-dioxide scrubbers.   Nitric oxide is converted to nitrogen
              dioxide by reaction with  sulfur dioxide and oxygen in the gas phase; the
              reactants are  already present in the off-gases from sulfur-containing coal. 
              This  effort provides a laboratory-scale feasibility study of the process  at
              reaction times and temperatures suitable to application in the  flues of
              boilers and furnaces.    Removal of the oxides of sulfur and nitrogen from
              combustion flues  is essential to improvement of air quality and reduction of
              acid  rain.  This effort offers the prospect of controlling both sets of 
              oxides at once, with a technology that might be a suitable retrofit  to
              existing sulfur-control systems.
