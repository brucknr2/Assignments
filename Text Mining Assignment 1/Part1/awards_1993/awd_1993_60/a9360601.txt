Abstract    :
                Proposal   Number:  III-9360601    PI:   Stanley Harrison      Institution: 
              Harrison Engineering    Title:  Low-Cost Scanning Electron Microscope  and
              Multimedia  Teaching Materials for High School Science      This project aims
              to improve upon an existing prototype of a scanning electron  microscope (SEM).
               The prototype developed has a magnification of 1000x.  It is  intended to
              improve this to a maximum of 10,000x and to cost about $1,000 for  the SEM
              system exclusive of the vacuum system.  In addition modules for the use  of
              such a system in the precollege classroom will be developed and tested.
