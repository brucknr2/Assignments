Abstract    :
              9360836  Oh         The proposed technique will utilize a tunable, wavelength 
              modulated UV beam near 308 nm, generated by sum frequency mixing  the output of
              a high power single mode diode laser with the single  frequency output from an
              Ar+ laser in a nonlinear crystal, to  access the OH A 2 +  X 2  band.  This
              approach promises to yield  good temporal and spatial resolution in
              tropospheric OH  measurements due to improved detection sensitivity by high 
              frequency wavelength modulation detection.  In Phase I, laboratory  experiments
              will be conducted to generate the frequency modulated  UV beam and to measure
              OH radicals in a discharge-flow reactor.   The results of these experiments
              will provide a basis for critical  assessment of the feasibility of this
              technique for tropospheric  measurements and will establish the crucial design
              parameters for  development of field instrumentation in Phase II.  ***
