Abstract    :
              9360779  Hawkins  An external guided wave optical modulator is proposed which
              provides the combination of high bandwidth, low insertion loss and linearity. 
              Apeldyn will design, fabricate, and test a novel multiple quantum well
              electroabsorption modulator, designed to operate at an optical wavelength of
              1300 nm, at microwave frequencies in excess of 40 GHz, with an insertion loss
              of less than 3dB, a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 40dB, a composite triple
              beat dynamic range of at least 55db and a two-tone spurious free dynamic range
              of at least 80dB.  The multiple quantum well layer will consist of indium
              gallium arsenide phosphide wells with indium phosphide barriers.  Our modulator
              design is small, lightweight and rugged.  ***
