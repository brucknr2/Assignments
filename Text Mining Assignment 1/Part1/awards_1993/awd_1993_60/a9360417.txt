Abstract    :
              9360417 Lintz          OPTRA will develop an innovative magnetic field sensing
              technique that achieves very high sensitivity for earth surveying applications,
              but unlike all competing SQUID technologies, does not require any cooling.  The
              new magtometer uses newly developed optical materials and OPTRA's proprietary
              interferometric phase measurement technique.  The system consists of a small
              sensor head (2 inch cube) containing only passive, non conductive optical
              materials and an optical/electronic processing unit connected together via
              optical fiber.  The sensor head can be implemented as a first or second order
              gradient sensor; however, the extraordinary linearity and dynamic range of the
              technique allows high resolution operation within the earth's DC magnetic field
              (field biasing is not required).          The operating principle is the
              accurate measurement of the Faraday rotation of an optical beam in an advanced,
              high Verdet coefficient, optical crystal.  OPTRA has demonstrated the
              measurement concept with a 10 mm long by 1.5 mm diameter transducer element and
              achieved 0.5 nT/ Hz minimum detectable field.  Further development during the
              proposed program will develop a three axis sensor and improve the performance
              to the 10 14 T/Hz range, comparable to SQUID sensors.  The sensor bandwidth is
              from DC to 50 kHz or more.
