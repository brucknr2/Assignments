Abstract    :
              9360217  Sabbagh       The ability to solve inverse problems lies at the heart 
              of electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation (NDE).  These  problems are
              difficult to solve for two reasons: they are  mathematically ill-conditioned,
              and they are nonlinear,  which means that they involve considerable
              computational  effort, often requiring supercomputer capabilities.  In this 
              proposal, we describe an inversion algorithm for  electromagnetic
              (eddy-current) NDE that will run on a wide  class of machines, from personal
              computers and workstations  to minisuper-computers and larger machines. 
              Furthermore, we  expect an improved robustness that will mitigate the effects 
              of ill-conditioning.  The algorithm employs modern  mathematical ideas of set
              theoretic estimation and robust  statistical analysis.  The technology that we
              are developing  in this project will be applicable to nondestructive 
              evaluation of materials and structures, electromagnetic  tomography, computer
              vision, and manufacturing science and  technology.
