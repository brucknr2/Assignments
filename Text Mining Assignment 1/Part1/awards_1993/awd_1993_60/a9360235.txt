Abstract    :
              9360235 Vithayathil          Adjustable speed 3 phase AC motor drives are now
              preferred over DC motor systems, for many industrial drives and battery powered
              cars.  This is because, static inverters, with adjustable frequency and
              voltage, are reliable and economical.  Induction motors provide brushless
              operation.  But they have slip and a relatively low lagging power factor. 
              Synchronous motors have better power factor and no slip.  They are also better
              for vector control, for good dynamic performance. But brushless, exciterless
              synchronous motors have permanent magnet rotors and so lack easy adjustability
              of flux and power factor.           We propose to do the feasibility research
              on an AC motor drive, for which the principal investigator has obtained a US
              Patent.  The machine is synchronous, but brushless and does not need exciter or
              permanent magnets.  The stator creates an auxiliary rotating field, besides the
              main field.  The auxiliary field rotates at a different rpm and serves to
              induce AC currents in the rotor circuit.  This AC is rectified by means of
              rotor mounted diodes, to provide DC excitation, for synchronous running with
              respect to the main field.  The field is adjustable from the stator side.  The
              program covers the fabrication of both the motor and the matching inverter.
