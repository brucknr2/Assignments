Abstract    :
              9360609  Chen  Conventional structural evaluation methods often fail to  provide
              accurate defect measurement of large civil  infrastructures.  This project
              brings in theoretical and  experimental expertise in structural dynamics and
              experience  in vibration sensors to study innovative slope mode and  modal
              energy transfer sensors and measuring systems that  could make structural
              behavior evaluation and health  monitoring more feasible and accurate.    The
              ultimate goal is to develop a series of slope  accelerometers, which are not
              yet available commercially,  based on a newly developed complex energy theory. 
              The  objective in phase one is to develop the accelerometers and  calibration
              systems, to examine methods for modal energy  measurements to perform the
              vibration signature analysis for  medium size structures.    The methodology
              and transducers considered in this project  may have a significant impact in
              structural measurements and  applications in transducer industries, bridge and
              large  civil engineering structure inspections.    This is an SBIR Phase I
              project.  ***
