Abstract    :
                  9360189  Weissman  This research is to develop a constitutive law for
              binder-aggregate  mixtures that are used in pavements.  These materials are in 
              elastic and develop ruts and cracks due to cyclic loads at elevated 
              temperatures.  A nonlinear viscoplastic constitutive law with  damage included
              will be developed.  This model will be based on  micromechanical considerations
              and will take both thermal and  mechanical cycling into consideration.  The
              model will be  incorporated into a finite element program to simulate binder- 
              aggregate pavement behavior.  ***
