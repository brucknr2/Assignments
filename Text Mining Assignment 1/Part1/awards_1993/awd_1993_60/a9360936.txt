Abstract    :
              9360936  Fang  This SBIR Phase I project will seek to determine the  technical
              feasibility of an implantable nerve stimulator for  bladder control in patients
              with paralysis.  During the  period of the award the system requirements would
              be  established for clinical application, conceptual design for  the
              implantable stimulator and its external controller, the  waveform generator,
              and the output driver.  Successful  completion of the Phase I project will
              provide the basis for  identifying the technical challenges for Phase II
              prototype  device development.  ***
