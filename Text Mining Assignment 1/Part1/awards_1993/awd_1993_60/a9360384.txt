Abstract    :
              9360384  Lafe  This project will develop a new technique for achieving massive 
              compression of data based on Cellular Automata (CA) computing.  The research
              will make use of the special characteristics of a  group of CA to evolve
              through certain states regardless of the  complexity of their initial
              configuration.  For certain kinds of  data, the method will be capable of high
              quality compression  ratios in excess of 10,000:1.    This technology will
              impact industries such as telecommunication,  cable television, computer data
              storage, aerospace and defense.  Three different products will be developed
              from this research: a  CA software compressor/decompressor, a VLSI
              implementation of the  CA code, and board level products based on the VLSI
              chip.  ***
