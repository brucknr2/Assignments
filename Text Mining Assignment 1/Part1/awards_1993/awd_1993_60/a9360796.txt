Abstract    :
              9360796  Wang  Monolithic integration of silicon  avalanche photodiode (APD)
              arrays with  their associated  electronics is  proposed. The photodiode
              elements are  based on the state-of-the-art process   developed by Radiation
              Monitoring  Devices, Inc., which achieves uniform  bulk breakdown by using
              neutron  transmutation doped silicon and a  "beveled junction" to suppress
              surface   breakdown. ARACOR intends to  combine these photodiode arrays with 
              their readout electronics  by using a  special bonded wafer approach to 
              achieve three-dimensional integration.  In the  proposed approach, the already 
              processed photodiode wafer will be  bonded to a prime wafer. The  readout 
              electronics will be processed in this  prime wafer after it has been thinned. 
              The readabout electronics and  photodiodes will be fully dielectrica11y 
              isolated with electrical connections  made by means of vias opened through  the
              silicon film and buried dielectric.  The Phase I feasibility study  will 
              include fabrication of a two element  APD array, integration of this array into
               a bonded wafer  substrate, and  processing of the interconnects.  ARACOR will
              design readout electronics  and fabricate a prototype of the  inregrated
              detector array in Phase II. In  Phase II, ARACOR intends to   incorporate these
              integrated detector  arrays into its own systems and provide  OEM components to
               others in  cooperation with RMD.
