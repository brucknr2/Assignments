Abstract    :
              9360985 Weiland          The increasing complexity of flexible manufacturing
              systems (FMSs) are pushing the human operator to his limits, especially in
              cognitive related tasks.  It is therefore of particular importance to develop
              techniques that allow the computer to help the human to extend these limits. 
              An important class of such enabling technologies is an     interactive man
              machine interface (IMMI),    which intelligently supports the human to find,
              process, and act on the rich information avaioable.            This research
              will focus on an innovative approach to building an IMMI for advanced
              manufacturing systems, based on an innovative cognitive modeling methodology
              called COGNET (COGnition as a NEtwork for Tasks) and a corresponding software
              implementation technique call BATON (Blackboard Architecture for Task Oriented
              Networks).  Together, COGNET and BATON allow us to build a powerful
              computational model of the operator and embed this model in the MMI software,
              thereby providing an essential ingredient in an IMMI for future FMSs.  During
              the Phase I effort, the researchers will evaluate the applicability of the
              COGNET/BATON methodlogy to advanced manufacturing systems, identifycandidate
              functions and development platforms for the IMMI, produce a Phase II
              development plan, and build a rapid interface prototype of the IMMI concept.
