Abstract    :
              9360671  Gordon    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in
              the general area of inorganic  chemistry and in the subfield of Metalorganic
              Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). The  objective of the Phase I research is
              the design, synthesis, and decomposition studies of  organolead precursors to
              lead titanate, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and lead lanthanum titanate 
              (PLZT). These materials are ferroelectric ceramics and find uses in
              radiation-hard memories,  electrooptic spatial light modulators, piezoelectric
              actuators and infrared detectors. Currently  used precursors are either too
              volatile and too toxic, e.g. tetraethyllead or not volatile enough  for MOCVD
              applications. Two new classes of lead alkoxides will be prepared; (1) lead 
              alkoxides with spatially demanding ligands to prevent aggregation, an (2)
              cyclopentadienyllead  alkoxides, believed to be more stable than alkyllead
              precursors. Following purification and  characterization of the lead
              precursors, they will be decomposed along with appropriate titanium  and/or
              zirconium alkoxides to produce lead titanate or PZT films.  %%%  Chemical vapor
              deposition of lead-based ferroelectric films is desirable for a variety of
              electronic  devices. Synthesis of safer, optimized lead precursors will have an
              immediate effect on the  market for these materials.  ***
