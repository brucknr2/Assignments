Abstract    :
              9360293  Bruns    Adaptive optics systems are essential for high resolution
              imaging from ground based telescopes.   Partial atmospheric correction systems
              substantially improve meter-class telescopes in the visible  spectral region. 
              These systems provide both resolution and minimum detectable magnitude 
              improvements for many science targets.  The feasibility of an inexpensive
              system correcting  small amounts of tilt, defocus, and astigmatism will be
              analyzed in this program.  Both  wavefront corrector and the wavefront sensor
              will be designed with standard components used  in novel configurations.  The
              ultimate cost of a low-volume production system should be only  $10,000,
              affordable to small observatories.  The wavefront corrector will be based on
              translating  thin lenses, arranged so that each translation corrects mainly one
              aberration.  Voice coil  actuators can move the lenses up to 0.1 mm at over 100
              Hz, allowing a low voltage design with  simple alignment and calibration.  The
              wavefront sensor will be designed around a small,  inexpensive CCD sensor in
              either a Hartmann or image sharpening configuration.  Since four  or fewer
              subapertures can measure the wavefront aberrations, only a small area of the
              CCD  needs to be digitized.  Standard camera electronics will provide the
              millisecond-regime time  response required by the wavefront corrector.  ***
