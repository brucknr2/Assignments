Abstract    :
              9360458  Robertazzi    SIS heterodyne receivers integrated with on-chip local
              oscillators for use in radio astronomy will  be developed.  The receivers will
              incorporate superconducting tunnel junctions (SIS junctions)  as the mixing
              elements together with Josephson junction local oscillators to provide mixing
              in  the 50-700 GHz frequency band.  Local oscillators based on the ac Josephson
              effect have  demonstrated operation up to frequencies in excess of the
              superconducting tunnel junction gap  frequency, about 1.5 THz for Nb and 3 THz
              for NbN.  These oscillators may be tuned  electrically, are extremely compact
              and dissipate small amounts of power.  Recently, Josephson  junction array
              oscillators have been fabricated from which more than 125 nW has been coupled 
              into a 10 ohm load at 105 GHz.  The oscillators will be used to produce
              monolithic  millimeter/submillimeter wave heterodyne receivers.  These
              receivers have intrinsic utility for  radio astronomy, and would have
              application in advanced communication and radar systems as  well.  ***
