Abstract    :
              9360488  Goodman      The use of high energy (1-5 MeV), high power (250 kW-1 MW)
              electron beams allows the low cost fabrication of unique high temperature
              materials which are not economically manufactured using conventional
              fabrication methods.  Materials which can fabricated using this process include
              nickel-based super alloys with graded thermal and mechanical properties and
              ceramic-reinforced TixAl and NixAl metal-matrix composited.  The electron beam
              fabrication process melts and consolidates pure or alloy powders, woven or
              particulate reinforcement material and metal foils to produce net shape
              structures.      Science Research Laboratory has developed a new generation of
              pulsed linear induction accelerators (LIA) which allow reliable, cost efficient
              production of high average power electron beams with the necessary parameters
              for high energy electron beam (HEEB) material fabrication.  Unique features of
              these accelerators include high repetition rate (>5000pps) all-solid-state
              pulsed power drivers which make these accelerators scalable to megawatt power
              levels at a capital cost of the accelerator is approximately $2/Watt.    ***
