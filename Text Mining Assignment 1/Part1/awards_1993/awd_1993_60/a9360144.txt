Abstract    :
              9360144  Kaplan  Superconductive circuits are proving effective in processing
              very high speed data streams.  For example, HYPRES has demonstrated an 8-bit
              analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with 4.4 effective bits at 4 GHz, and 2
              effective bits at 7 GHz.  We project an ADC performance of 6 effective bit at
              10 GHz.  However, the ability of superconductive circuits to work at such high
              data rates renders it difficult to communicate with room-temperature circuitry.
               We address this problem in this proposal.    We propose to design, fabricate
              and test a demultiplexer circuit to divert high-speed data into several
              lower-speed channels.  Each channel will be clocked at a rate low enough for
              conventional circuits.    The demultiplexer will be compatible with our ADC,
              and will be general enough to be used in other applications where the data rate
              is too high for conventional circuits.  During Phase I, proof of principle will
              be demonstrated with  a 1:4 demultiplexer.  The design will be modular so that
              extension to a circuit with a larger demultiplexer ratio is be straightforward.
               In Phase II, the operation of the demultiplexer will be demonstrated as part
              of a high-speed monolithic ADC chip.  ***
