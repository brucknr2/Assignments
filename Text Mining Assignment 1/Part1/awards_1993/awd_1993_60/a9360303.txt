Abstract    :
              9360303  Cappo    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
               seeks to fulfill the critical need in education for the development  of
              innovative assessment techniques that support the emergence of  new teaching
              strategies, reflect what is known about the process of  learning, and measure
              higher levels of reasoning.  Studies by the  Office of Technology Assessment
              (OTA) and the Association for  Supervision and Curriculum Development, as well
              as state reform  movements, have identified the importance of a variety of 
              assessments.  These formats include oral discussion, group work,  portfolios,
              self-assessment, peer grading, observation, and  performance-based tests, as
              well as standard written and multiple  choice tests.  To incorporate these new
              ideas so that teachers can  move from the use of traditional to current
              alternative assessment  methods of students, teachers will require tracking and
              recording  devices that are unobtrusive and adaptable.  Also needed is a bank 
              of assessment tasks and scoring techniques which focuses on higher  levels of
              thinking.  The firm Learning in Motion proposes to test  the feasibility of
              designing assessment tasks and software systems,  which may include new
              pen-based technology, to improve the quality  of education and meet the
              educational needs identified by OTA, the  Association for Supervision and
              Curriculum Development and state  reform movements.     Recognizing that
              curriculum reform and assessment reform must go  hand-in-hand, Learning in
              Motion seeks to make an important  contribution to the realization of
              curriculum reform via assessment  reform.   ***
