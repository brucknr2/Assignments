Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: 9360030  PI Last Name: Barnett         Technology International
              Incorporated (TII) shall perform  research involving a rapid prototype of a
              microprocessor simulation  toolkit (MSTKit) and education software for learning
              the  intricacies of computer processing technology.  The kit would be 
              developed for customization of education modules for high school  senior level
              up to the sophomore year at the college level, as well  as vocational training.
               Powerful graphics capabilities will allow  the user access to information
              unattainable by emulators presented  by hardware boards or by costly
              software/hardware combinations.   The feasibility of the concept of developing
              nonexpensive, flexible  education software for learning about microprocessors
              will be  evaluated taking into account the availability of expensive  hardware
              emulators and platform-specific kits.  The feasibility of  the kit will be
              evaluated in terms of the capability to learn about  various microprocessors
              using appropriate microcomputer instruction  sets.  By creation of an
              environment where the computer of interest  is simulated, users will be able to
              write and debug a program in  the related instruction set and interactively see
              the inner  workings of that particular microprocessor, including timing 
              diagrams.  Consideration will be given to advanced optical  computing and
              neural computing.  Other microprocessors (real or  fictitious, that is,
              user-created) could be added to the kit.  ***y
