Abstract    :
              9360816  Nelson  The development of a national fiber optic communications
              network has recently been proposed as an important objective of our overall
              infrastructure development in order to maintain and improve U.S.
              competitiveness in high technology.  Optical switching will no doubt ply an
              important role in the functioning of many of the most advanced aspects of this
              high speed network.  In this proposal, Foster-Miller presents a new approach to
              optically activated switching based on the resonantly-enhanced nonlinear
              optical switching in rare-earth doped fluoride fibers.  Together with our team
              partners, Dr. Richard Pantell, Director of the Stanford University Ginzton
              Laboratory and Dr. Paul France of British Telecom Research Laboratories, we
              will experimentally demonstrate during Phase I an expected order of magnitude
              improvement in performance of the fluoride fiber based switch over previous
              experiments.  We project that with the known properties of doped fluoride
              fibers, we will be able to both lower the required pump power and reduce the
              interaction length to produce a compact and low power all-fiber switch.  During
              Phase II we will design, fabricate, test and deliver very high speed all-fiber
              switches for use in optical matrix applications, optical computing and optical
              interconnects, local area networks and telecommunications.  ***
