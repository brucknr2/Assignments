Abstract    :
                     9360484  Hun    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project  will simultaneously stimulate entrepreneurship among Native 
              Hawaiians, a community with a history of underrepresentation in the  business
              sector, and teach Native Hawaiian students the culturing  of snails/fish/and
              hydrophonics via the efficient use of effluent  water.  Students will be
              exposed to many areas of the biological  sciences in an appropriate learning
              context predicated on an  understanding of Hawaiian culture and will be offered
              hands-on  experience in hydroponic experimentation.  From the beginning of  the
              project, they will be able to participate in and contribute to  scientific
              research that involves actual commercialization.    Native Hawaiian students
              will be shown how their indigenous  technology combines with scientific
              principles to produce  ecologically sound and environmentally benign outcomes,
              and they  will be stimulated to be creative--to expand the concept of a  closed
              hydroponic system to other plants and beyond.  The major  educational product
              of this project will be the cultivation of  human resources.  ***
