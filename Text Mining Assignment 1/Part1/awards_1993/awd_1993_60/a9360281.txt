Abstract    :
              9360281  Kebabian         Analysis of the stable isotopes in atmospheric methane
              samples  can be used to identify local sources and to define the global  budget
              of this radiatively important greenhouse gas.  This proposal  would develop a
              portable and less expensive alternative to isotope  mass spectrometry for
              measuring 13CH4 and CH3D components in methane  samples.  The method is based
              on infrared absorption using a helium  neon laser at 2999.24 cm-1.  The laser
              line can be Zeeman shifted  into coincidence with closely spaced line pairs of
              13CH4 - 12CH4 and  CH3D - CH4 so that both ratios may be obtained with a single
               instrument and sample.  Phase I research will identify the exact  line
              positions of these pairs and the laser line using tunable  diode laser
              spectroscopy, and will establish the baseline  parameters for evaluating the
              ultimate sensitivity of the  technique.  In Phase II, the prototype instrument
              will be  constructed and intercompared with samples analyzed by mass 
              spectrometry.  ***
