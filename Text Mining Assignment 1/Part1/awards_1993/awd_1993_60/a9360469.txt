Abstract    :
              9360469 Becker  There is an urgent, growing need for Tactual (Paperless Braille)
              Display Units (TDSUs) that serve the blind the way Visual Display Units (VDUs)
              serve sighted computer users.  But today's "dot" technology is complex,
              expensive, limited to single display lines and inherently unable to furnish the
              MULTILINE, realtime, "monitor screens" needed to provide the blind access
              equality with the sighted.  TACTILICS new and different dot technology can
              provide multiline monitors of any practical size that can simultaneously
              communicate with the sighted.  Screens of individually addressable "cells" will
              make editing fast and easy.  Dramatically reduced costs, will allow TACTILICS
              realtime, multiline, braille monitors to be made and sold at prices far below
              today's prohibitive (singleline) levels.  The research performed by this
              project will lead to cost effective, one on one teaching systems that provide
              the blind with direct access to data bases, bulletin boards, CD ROMs and other
              low cost sources of information.  The elimination of Braille/sightprint
              "barriers" will open many doors.  Being able to work directly with the sighted
              will create new employment opportunities.  Consequently, the tasks of learning,
              growing, and gaining independence will be made easier. ***
