Abstract    :
              9360007 Schmanski          Thermoset polymer composites have been used as
              building materials for many years and are successfully used in the construction
              of marine vessels, aircraft, buildings, and space vehicles.  Pultrusion is one
              well known process that is used throughout industry to manufacture composites. 
              Composites can be reinforced with fiberglass, carbon, or other fibers to create
              high strength, light weight, damage resistant materials.  The predictable high
              strength characteristics of the composites, allows thin sections and these are
              used in combination with other materialls, such as insulation or sound blocking
              medium, creating sandwich type building material.  The material used with
              composites is often manufactured thhru an extrusion process.  This requires
              expensive, labor intensive operations to create the final construction
              materials from composites and extruded material.          We propose to develop
              a manufacturing process that will combine pultrusion and extrusion processes
              into one  operation.  This will eliminate the expensive, labor intensive
              operatin required for fabricating two materials into the combined building
              material.  This research will concentrate on creating an extrusion process that
              can simultaneously be utilized as part of the pultrusion process.   The
              extruded member will be integral to the pultrusion die and will act as the
              mandrel as it is formed ahead ofthe pultrusion die.  The result will be a
              building materials that has dual materials makeup without the expensive
              fabrication process.  This project would result in a sophisticated, highly
              effecient and economical building material that would have multiple uses both
              indoors and in outside   environments.
