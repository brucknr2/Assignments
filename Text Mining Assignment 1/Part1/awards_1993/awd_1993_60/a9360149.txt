Abstract    :
              9360149  Ballance  In this research we propose to develop and demonstrate a
              model  for scalable high performance computing software.  Our approach 
              combines two existing computing paradigms.  The first is a model  for dynamic
              load balancing that has been tested on Multiple-  Instruction Multiple-Data
              (MIMD) machines.  The second is a  reusable software design called a
              "framework."  The framework is  an object-based software architecture that
              assists the programmer  in modifying existing and in building new scientific
              codes.  It  also improves programmer productivity by assisting program 
              component and design reuse.
