Abstract    :
              9360489  Simpson  Fisheries have become an increasingly more significant food
              source.  Currently 30% of the protein consumed by Americans comes from the sea
              and this percentage is growing.  Over the past decade fisheries have
              experienced more regulation because of bycatch -- that portion of a fisherman's
              catch that is not the primary target.  Because of the increased regulation
              caused by bycatch, fisheries management has become increasingly more difficult.
               Techniques that can automatically and non-intrusively detect, classify, and
              quantify fish populations are of intense interest to all levels of fisheries
              management.  Technologies are needed to improve the ability of fisheries
              management to monitor the fisheries.  One area that will immediately benefit
              the fisheries is a more efficient and effective technique automatically to
              detect and classify fish.  A sonar system with these capabilities does not
              currently exist.  The transition of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) sonar signal
              classification technology to fisheries would be of great benefit to American
              Fishing fleets, American fisheries management groups, and to our dwindling
              American manufacturing base.  Scientific Fishery Systems, Inc. (SFS) is
              developing a fish detection and classification system that utilizes these
              defense technologies.
