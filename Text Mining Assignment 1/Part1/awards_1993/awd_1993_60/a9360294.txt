Abstract    :
              9360294 Abramson  This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's
              (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to
              provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small high
              technology firm, to participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the SBIR program
              serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can
              do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase
              III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications
              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or
              other non-federal financing.  The focus of this Phase I project is to develop
              the technology of a new kind of CDMA which uses only one common code for all
              users of the network. It would replace or work with the three different types
              of multiple access protocols which are used in most wireless data networks
              today - TDMA, CDMA and ALOHA.   The protocol is called Spread ALOHA CDMA, and
              could simplify the implementation of CDMA while increasing the overall
              efficiency of the multiple access protocol.
