Abstract    :
              9360118  Stark  It has been suggested that a hypothetical crystalline material,
              B-  C3N4, may be harder than diamond, provide exceptional wear and  corrosion
              resistance, and exhibit an extremely low coefficient of  friction.  No one yet
              has successfully synthesized continuous  films of crystalline carbon nitride. 
              Such an achievement would  represent a technical milestone.  The availability
              of superhard B-  C3N4 in the form of an adherent, solid lubricant coating would
               permit significant advances to be made in tribology.    The innovation we
              propose is the synthesis of metastable,  crystalline carbon nitride films by
              dual ion beam assisted  deposition (DIBAD).  The DIBAD process has been used
              successfully  to synthesize metastable materials such as cubic boron nitride. 
              It also offers considerable promise for successfully growing  films of B-C3N4. 
              The key to successful synthesis is momentum  transfer into the films per
              arriving atom.  DIBAD provides a  wider window of operation than does a single
              ion beam evaporation  process.    In phase 1, we will demonstrate the
              feasibility of growing  continuous films of stoichiometric and
              near-stoichiometric B-C3N4  by the DIBAD process.  Deposition conditions will
              be defined and  the films characterized in terms of their composition, 
              morphology, density, structure, thermal stability, adhesion and  tribological
              properties.  ***
