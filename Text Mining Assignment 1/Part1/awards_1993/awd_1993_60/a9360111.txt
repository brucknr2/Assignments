Abstract    :
              9360111  Chapman  The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility
              of  effectively removing halocarbons from wastes by subjecting them  to
              radiofrequency glow discharges which produce radical and ion  intermediates. 
              These intermediates, upon recombination are  expected to produce polymers that
              may be less well-defined than  commercial polymers but which possess properties
              that make them  more acceptable for some applications than the polymers of 
              current commercial importance.    This is a Phase I award based on a proposal
              submitted in response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Program  Solicitation.  Results of this project are expected to provide  the
              basis for determining the technical feasibility of this  process to produce
              results equivalent to those achieved by  alternative oxidative and thermal
              processes now used to destroy  halogenated chemical compounds in wastes.
