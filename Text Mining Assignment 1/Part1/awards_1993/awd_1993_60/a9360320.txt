Abstract    :
              9360320 Spooner  This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's
              (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to
              provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small high
              technology firm, to participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the SBIR program
              serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can
              do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase
              III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications
              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or
              other non-federal financing.  This Phase I project analyzes the development of
              a blind channel identifier/equalizer (BCIE) suitable for use on digital
              communication signals such as BPSK, QPSK, M-PSK, and M-ary QAM, which are
              corrupted by unknown channel distortion and noise.  The BCIE is needed to
              reliably extract the transmitted message from the received data.  Areas being
              investigated are the tradeoffs in using BCIE vs more conventional equalizers;
              the range of operating environments; the performance and applicability of the
              candidate BCIE algorithms; and the commercially available DSP hardware
              appropriate for prototype imlementation of the candidate BCIE algorithm.
