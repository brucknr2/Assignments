Abstract    :
              This research is on a novel technique to increase the capacity of  mobile
              cellular communications systems.  It uses a small array of  antennas to
              separate multiple co-channel signals, parametric  modeling of the FM/PM signals
              impinging on the array, and makes use  of both spatial and temporal information
              to separate the signals.   Efficient estimation of the model parameters is
              achieved by using  the recently developed Discrete Polynomial Transform (DPT) -
              a  nonlinear transform for estimating the parameters of multi-  component,
              polynomial phase signals.  Phase I efforts include the  development of
              DPT-based signal-selective array processing  technique for separating 2 or 3
              signals, and performance studies by  analysis and computer simulation.
