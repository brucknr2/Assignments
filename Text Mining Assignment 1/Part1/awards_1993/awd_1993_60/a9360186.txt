Abstract    :
              9360186  Flusberg    Recently declassified military research has validated the
              applicability of artificial guide stars to  atmospheric compensation for
              astronomical observations.  Of the two alternative guide-star  techniques that
              have been demonstrated, the more promising is the laser-induced generation of 
              an artificial star in the sodium layer located at an altitude of 95 km.  The
              required laser power  depends strongly on the observation wavelength of the
              telescope.  It ranges from about 2 watts  in the infrared (2000 nm) to 300
              watts in the visible (500 nm).  For a large, visible-light  telescope, a pulsed
              laser beam with approximately one joule of energy, repetitively pulsed at 
              several hundred hertz and tuned to the 589-nm sodium-D line is needed to
              generate a suitable  guide star.  To make this source acceptable to the
              astronomical community, such a laser should  be inexpensive, compact and
              reliable.  A flashlamp-pumped dye-laser system will be developed  for this
              application.  Recent advances in flashlamp-pumped dye-laser design have greatly
               increased the achievable efficiency and beam quality, while recently developed
              all-solid-state  magnetic-compression-pulser technology that has demonstrated a
              lifetime of 7 x 1010 shots in  similar applications can be used to make pulsed
              dye laser much more compact and reliable.   These advances and recently
              developed dye-laser modeling codes will be used to design a guide-  star laser
              source.  ***
