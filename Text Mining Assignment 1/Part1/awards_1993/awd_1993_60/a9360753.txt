Abstract    :
              9360753  Ramanujan    This project is to develop a new approach to clustering 
              workstations, called the network shared memory approach.  It has  three
              specific advantages over other approaches:  (1) it is  capable of delivering
              performance that is at least an order of  magnitude better than that attainable
              using existing techniques  for clustering workstations; (2) it greatly
              simplifies the  programming task by providing a shared memory abstraction to
              the  programmer; and (3) the cost of attaining this performance and 
              programmability is several times lower than that of commercially  available
              shared memory parallel processors of comparable  computing power.    The
              results of this work can be applied to cluster workstations  into a
              high-performance parallel computer at a fraction of the  cost of commercial
              parallel computers.      ***
