Abstract    :
              9360606  Nelson         The possibility that atomic chlorine concentrations in
              the  marine surface layer are large enough to compete with the hydroxyl 
              radical as the major tropospheric oxidizer has received  considerable
              speculation.  Chlorine atoms participate in the  oxidation of hydrocarbons and
              dimethyl sulfide and can also  directly influence tropospheric ozone loss
              through catalytic cycles  with chlorine monoxide and the hydroperoxy radicals. 
              The net  effect on the ozone budget may be highly dependent on the 
              partitioning of the inorganic chlorine pool between hydrochloric  acid,
              hypochlorous acid, chlorine gas, and chlorine nitrate.  In  order to assess the
              potential importance of chlorine chemistry,  direct measurements of these
              species are necessary.  In Phase I of  this research, the PIs will assess the
              feasibility of detecting  hypochlorous acid at the 10 to 20 ppt level using
              tunable diode  laser infrared absorption.  This will require (1) measurement of
               pressure broadening coefficients for selected absorption lines, (2) 
              identification of suitable spectral regions, (3) investigation of  photolytic
              modulation of hypocholorous acid to implement background  subtraction, and (4)
              design of novel multiple pass absorption cell  with a path length of at least
              600 meters.  Phase II research will  improve the basic spectroscopic parameters
              for quantifying  hypochlorous acid concentrations and develop a prototype field
               instrument capable of simultaneous measurements of hydrochloric  acid and
              hypochlorous acid in the marine atmosphere.  ***
