Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- III-9360771  PI:  SUDARSHAN    In this Phase I program, MMI proposes
              a significant innovation in the diamond coating of powders.  Using fluidized
              bed Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technology, diamond coated powders can be
              pressed into sheets or shaped parts.  Phase I will concentrate on production of
              the diamond coated powders, compaction and measurement of the properties while
              Phase II will be devoted to scaling up the reactor dimensions, formation of
              shapes using the coated diamond powders and subsequent characterization.  Rapid
              transition to Phase III is expected as commercial partners for testing of
              different products during the Phase II effort have already been identified.
