Abstract    :
              9360262  Kumar  This Phase I SBIR project is to determine the feasibility of 
              applying the high detection sensitivity of  SQUID technology  to the
              development of a very low magnetic field strength  magnetic resonance imaging
              (MRI) system for medical  applications.  It is hypothesized that the system
              would  provide a diagnostic imaging quality system at low cost  compared to
              conventional MRI systems.  ***
