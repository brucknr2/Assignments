                                 9360176 Sokol          In the materials industry, the
              product design is documented using hard copy material specifications.  Whereas
              the majority of discrete manufacturers have the availability of computerized
              tools like Computer Aided Design, material suppliers are primarily paper based.
               Since the material specification is the "hub" of all engineering activity, the
              totally paper based specifications have  been a major obstacle to implementing
              concurrent engineering in the material industry.                    This
              research will seek to define a conceptual design for the implementation of a
              computerized material specification system    i.e., a concurrent engineering
              design system for material suppliers.  The six month technical effort is
              structured to formulate the design with the assistance of two "industry
              partners" (a major titanium suppler and a major composite material supplier). 
              The proposed solution has strong commercial application at material suppliers
              such as steel, nickel, titanium, and composites companies; as well as the basic
              industries such as forging and casting companies.
