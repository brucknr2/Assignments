Abstract    :
              9360173  Seaver       This research is to demonstrate the accuracy and
              micro-radian   resolution of a two-dimensional stress-optic scanner.  In the 
              production of Pharmaceuticals, both the workpiece and the packaging  are too
              small for conventional bar codes.  Of particular importance  is the use of
              Automatic Identification to verify the correct  labeling of Pharmaceuticals. 
              Mislabeling has been a persistent  safety problem and labeling production lines
              are closely regulated  and inspected.  Producers of semiconductor wafers,
              semiconductor   chips, and printed circuit boards are shifting to
              two-dimensional  codes due to lack of space for the amount of data that needs
              to be  encoded.  The most reliable, accurate and fastest technique for  reading
              two-dimensional codes would be a solid-state scanning  approach; of the various
              techniques available stress-optics, using  an imposed stress in photoelastic
              materials, is the best for small  beams and fast, precise scanning through
              relatively small sweep  angles.       Stress can produce a such greater index
              change in some glasses   than can an electric field in electro-optical
              materials.  And  response rates up to megahertz are possible.  Also, the
              imposition  of a stress to optical glass does not increase its already 
              low-loss, and the response is non-dispersive.  Finally, optical  glasses are
              generally more rugged and environmentally stable and  cost less than do the
              materials used in other approaches.  The  manufacturability of the basic
              stress-optics sandwich is straight  forward and this would make it
              significantly cheaper than electro-  optical equivalent devices.  These last
              two advantages are   considered to be very important in the matrix code reader
              market.
