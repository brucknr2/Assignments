Abstract    :
              9360497  Westermo  This project will examine the design of peak strain and 
              deflection-based instrumentation systems for the post-  earthquake health
              monitoring of buildings and other civil  infrastructures.  The instrumentation
              systems are intended  to evaluate the local material damage at specific points 
              within a structure and be used to estimate, among other  things, the level of
              damage a structure has suffered and the  condition of the structure.    The
              work will entail designing several types  of sensors,  performing full static
              and dynamic tests, and investigating  approaches to designing a site-specific
              system and  interpretation of the sensor output.    The general distribution of
              high strains (or damage)  incurred during an earthquake event to optimize the
              location  of the sensors and the accuracy with which the system  predicts the
              damage will be evaluated.  The new technology  made available through this
              study can provide for an  economical and reliable means for structural safety 
              assessment.    There is a potential that prototype instrumentation systems 
              could be developed and applied.    This is an SBIR Phase I project.  ***
