Abstract    :
              9360805  Cook    This is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation 
              Research Solicitation.  An electrochemical "pump" for removal of  carbon
              dioxide from process streams is the objective.  The approach  uses a carrier
              molecule that binds carbon dioxide in its reduced  form and releases it when
              the carrier is oxidized.  Thus, carbon  dioxide is captured at the cathode and
              released at the anode; by  placing the two electrodes in different external
              environments,  carbon dioxide can be moved from the cathode (e.g. in a process 
              stream) to the anode (e.g. in a gas compressor input).    The proposal is
              directed toward improving the efficiency of ammonia  production, but the
              carbon-dioxide pump has a large  number of  potential applications, some of
              them very innovative.
