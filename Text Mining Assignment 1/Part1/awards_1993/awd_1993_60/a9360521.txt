Abstract    :
              9360521  Murthy  The objective of the proposed work is to develop efficient and 
              accurate computational techniques for the solution of moving  front problems
              such as those occuring in phase-change, pollutant  dispersal, groundwater
              transport and others.  We will use MIMD  parallel processing to obtain the
              computational speed necessary  to solve these computer-intensive problems. 
              Phase I of the project will be devoted to developing tools for  dynamic
              partitioning and load balancing.
