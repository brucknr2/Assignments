Abstract    :
              9360498 Tang          Production of microelectronic devices with pattern
              features in the sub 0.25 micron regime will require significant advances in
              microlithographic and manufacturing technologies.  Current I line stepper tools
              are patterning state of the art devices with Depth of Focus (DOF) budgets of 1
              micron and below, a manufacturing nightmare.  Recent research has demonstrated
              that Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) planarization significantly alleviates
              DOF problems by achieving superior global planarization.  CMP planarization
              technology has the potential to extend current manufacturing tools to the 0.25
              micron regime and beyond.  However, the major problem with CMP is that
              currently, there is no effective, commercially available means of measuring and
              controlling the thickness of the layer being planarized in a real time, in situ
              manner.          The purpose of this research is to develop a non contact
              technology and method to provide real time, in situ process control for CMP
              planarization.  Commercial applications of the research include:  a non
              iterative, precise CMP process; such a process is useful and relevant for most
              all types of integrated circuit manufacturing.
