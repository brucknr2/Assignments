Abstract    :
              9360267  Gosper  This project is to develop a prototype software system for 
              computing definite summations.  Some of the methods developed,  whether or not
              they succeed in finding a closed form result, will  offer an alternative
              expression, mathematically equivalent to the  sum but more rapidly convergent. 
              A secondary goal is to develop  in parallel, the complementary process of
              expanding expressions  into infinite series.    The resulting product will be
              embedded in Macsyma, an established  symbolic-numerical mathematics software
              system with many users  who will benefit from better technology for computing
              with  summations and series.  ***
