Abstract    :
              9360420  Diehl  This project provides a fundamental change in the way discrete 
              event simulation languages are constructed.  The approach  parallelizes the
              performance evaluation experiments instead of  the algorithms.  By taking
              advantage of recent theoretical  developments in performance sensitivity
              analysis and stochastic  optimization techniques, it will be possible to create
              a general  purpose discrete event simulation language that has the potential 
              of several orders of magnitude improvement in the efficiency of  performance
              evaluation of discrete event systems.    The project will result in a
              user-friendly software package for  general discrete event simulation with
              several orders of  magnitude speed improvement, and will enable the solution of
               performance evaluation and optimization  problems previously  thought to be
              beyond reach.  ***
