Abstract    :
                9360057  Guthrie    The researchers will seek to develop a tooling generator
              that would  produce Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) custom tooling from a design 
              database without human intervention.  Such a product would allow  PCB
              manufacturers to convert a critical step from an uncontrolled  manual procedure
              into a deterministic, measurable process.  Proven  techniques such as
              Statistical Process Control and continuous  improvement could then be applied
              to the custom tooling portion of  the PCB manufacturing process.  Printed
              Circuit Boards are an  essential component of almost every electrical and
              electronic  product sold today.  PCB Manufacturing is a complex process 
              involving many chemical, thermal, and mechanical steps.  Like other 
              manufacturing industries, PCB manufacturers seek to optimize each  of these
              steps to achieve the highest quality and the best yield.    Many of the key PCB
              manufacturing steps require tooling which is  unique for each PCB design
              produced.  The quality of this custom  tooling has a large effect on the yield
              and quality of the final  product.  The complex fine line patterns which the
              tooling must  accurately portray are contained in a design database.  Creation
              of  custom tooling from the design database is currently a manual  process
              performed by a human expert.  An automatic tooling  generator would bring a
              crucial portion of the PCB manufacturing  process under process control. 
              Manufacturers who adopted such a  product may increase competitiveness and
              lower costs through  optimized yield, higher quality, and shorter turnaround
              times.  ****
