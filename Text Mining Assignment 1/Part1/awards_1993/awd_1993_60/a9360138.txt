Abstract    :
              9360138  Hollingsworth    The recent observation of efficient visible
              luminescence form nanometer sized silicon crystallites has generated a great
              deal of excitement in the semiconductor community.  The emission of light about
              the bandgap of silicon is generally attributed to quantum confinement of
              carriers in crystallites with dimensions less than 5nm.  This research project
              will examine plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition as a method of producing
              nanocrystalline silicon thin films exhibiting visible luminescence.  Heavily
              doped micro crystalline films grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor
              deposition have been studied for many years for use in amorphous silicon
              photovoltaics.  The micro crystalline films consist of crystals with typical
              grain sizes less than 10nm surrounded by an amorphous silicon matrix.  It has
              been shown that removal of the amorphous matrix leaves nanocrystalline silicon
              with visible luminescence.  Undoped, p, and n type micro crystalline films will
              be grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition with subsequent etching
              of the amorphous matrix to leave nanocrystalline research, with the ultimate
              goal in Phase II of producing light emitting diodes on glass substrated for
              large area flat panel display applications.
