Abstract    :
              9360015  Mandel       This project is to study a new class of very promising 
              highly parallel iterative methods for the solution of large  scale systems
              which arise from high order elements (the p-  version finite element method) in
              three-dimensional  elasticity for  structures with plates, shells and 
              junctures.  The size of problems on interest now rules our  direct solvers, but
              high order elements, particularly thin  elements, give rise to very
              ill-conditioned systems of  equations, which necessitate new specific
              preconditioners.       The plan in Phase I is to investigate new methods for 
              preconditioning thin solid high order elements and to study  their performance
              on three-dimensional problems with up to  over one million degrees of freedom. 
              The design and  development will be guided by theoretical analyses as well  as
              extensive experimentation.  Phase I will result in a  coarse grained parallel
              prototype code running on CRAY-YMP.      Phase II will be concerned with
              eliminating bottlenecks  for very large problems, extending the capabilities of
              the  method to include complicated goemetries and development of  production
              level software for CRAY-YMP and IBM SP-1.       The project will further
              knowledge in the areas of  multilevel and domain decomposition computational
              methods on  parallel supercomputers.  The availability of the proposed  methods
              will have a significant impact on mechanical  engineering practice.
