Abstract    :
              9360146  Krieger   Synchrotron Radiation Induced X-ray Fluorescence Computed
              Tomography will provide a means of non-destructively mapping the three
              dimensional distribution of trace elements within a specimen.  Micron scale
              spatial resolution and PPM level sensitivity are potentially achievable.  The
              characteristic fluorescent line radiation from a trace element must be detected
              against the background flux of scattered radiation and fluorescent radiation
              from more abundant elements.  In phase I, Radiation Science will design a
              wavelength dispersive spectrometer that can be attached to fluorescence CT
              collimators within the confines of a beam hutch at a synchrotron light source. 
              Radiation Science will also develop a practical implementation of an algorithm
              for absorption corrected reconstruction of fluorescence CT data.  In phase II,
              Radiation Science will build a practical fluorescence CT system.  ***   v
