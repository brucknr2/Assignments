Abstract    :
              9360131  Adler    Using a metallurgically-clad composite as a "worksurface"
              capable of repeatedly performing the same heating operation with greater
              efficiencies than are obtainable with traditional heating methods, SmartHeat
              technology provides the benefits of conventional induction heating in a
              temperature range heretofore unattainable via conventional induction-heating
              technology.    The composite consists of a ferro-magnetic alloy boned to a Cu
              core.  Ferro-magnetic materials used in SmartHeat devices have been limited to
              FeNi binary alloys.  The effects associated with the Invar phenomenon in these
              alloys vix., near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), depressed
              magnetization, and extreme compositional sensitivity of the Curie temperature,
              have prevented full exploitation of SmartHeat technology.    In this research,
              properties of a new class of a class of FeNi-base ternary alloys will be
              predicted using a novel computer program.  Computer-predicted phase boundaries
              will allow determination of compositional ranges of interest.  Predicted
              compositional dependencies of Curie temperature and magnetic moments will be
              superposed on isothermal sections facilitating alloy selection with optimal 
              properties .  Using existing literature data, a model for quantitatively
              predicting CTE in terms of composition and temperature for binary alloys will,
              also, be developed.  This model will be incorporated into the computer database
              for use in future computer-designed materials projects.  ***
