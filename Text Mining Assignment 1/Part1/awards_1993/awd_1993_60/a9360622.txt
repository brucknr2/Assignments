Abstract    :
              9360622  Webb    Innova Labs proposes to extend photonic band gap materials fro
              the microwave frequency band into the millimeter wave frequency band.  We have
              identified potential new practical fabrication techniques for making these
              material with photonic band gap near 100 Ghz.  the materials would embody a
              hierarchical structure consisting of a high index of refraction composite with
              fine microstructure on the scale of microns which is fabricated into a coarser
              structure having a  periodic variation of index of refraction on the scale of a
              millimeter.  The project is to investigate these fabrication techniques and t
              characterize the electromagnetic properties of the resultant materials.   
              Photonic band gap materials have been shown to have extraordinary properties
              for applications in the microwave range.  If these properties can be extended
              to the millimeter wave range, they would make possible millimeter wave systems
              in which the designer has an unprecedented degree of control over radiation. 
              It will allow dielectric waveguide technology and MMIC techniques to be
              employed at millimeter wave frequency.  The result would be practical systems
              with greatly improved capabilities and with the potential for having
              considerably lower MMW component cost.
