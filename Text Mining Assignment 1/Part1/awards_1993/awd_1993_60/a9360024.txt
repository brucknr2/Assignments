Abstract    :
                    9360024  Drory  This objective of this research is to develop a novel
              interlayer to  allow diamond coatings of higher quality than has previously
              been  achieved to be deposited on steel substrates.  Steels present a 
              particularly difficult material for depositing high quality diamond  coatings
              onto because of chemical incompatibility and the large  difference in thermal
              expansion coefficients.  The emphasis in the  proposed work is to use a metal
              interlayer between the diamond  coating and the steel substrate to alleviate
              these difficulties.   The mechanical properties of coated test specimens will
              be  determined.  Friction and wear testing will be performed along with 
              measurement of the coating cracking stress, interface fracture  toughness and
              substrate yield strength.  ***
