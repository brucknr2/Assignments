Abstract    :
              9360813  Eddy    The preparation of epitaxial TlBaCaCuO (TBCCO) films has been
              demonstrated on only a small number of substrates (Lanthanum Aluminate and
              Strontium Titanate).  The films produced have been optimized primarily for
              microwave performance, and a more systematic evaluation of film properties is
              required.  This proposal outlines a program to investigate the microstructure -
              composition - superconducting properties relationships for the growth of high
              quality, epitaxial TBCCO films.  In addition to this analysis, the mechanism
              for preparing low resistance metal contacts to TBCCCO will be explored. 
              Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) will be used to investigate the film
              microstructure and metal-TBCCO interface. The goals of the program are to
              optimize the composition of the TBCCO deposits  to produce a more homogeneous
              film capable of maintaining  high quality superconducting properties even at
              the narrowest line widths (<5um), and to understand and improve the
              metal-superconductor contacts.  It is essential for the preparation of the
              highest quality to control key process variables and have the ability to vary
              parameters for process optimization.  We believe optimization.  We believe
              optimization of composition is the most important next step for improvement of
              TBCCO films to meet the stringent requirements imposed by the next generation
              of superconducting film applications.  ***
