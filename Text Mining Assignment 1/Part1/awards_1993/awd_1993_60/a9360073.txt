Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- III-9360073  PI:  OWENS    A new electron source for high-energy
              electron beam welding is proposed which is simple, yet capable of impressive
              beam brightness and high energy in a compact structure.  The new device can
              achieve reduced spot size, increased energy density, and increased range over
              conventional electron-beam welders.  Using special techniques, welding at
              atmospheric pressures over long distances may even be possible.  During the
              first phase of the project, a simple electron-beam welding device will be
              fabricated and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept.  A
              high-brightness, high-energy device will be constructed during Phase II of the
              project.
