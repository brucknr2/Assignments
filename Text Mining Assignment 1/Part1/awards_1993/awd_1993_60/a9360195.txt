Abstract    :
              9360195  Jiang    Porous inorganic membranes can be used at high temperatures,
              and have high fluxes, mechanical strength and chemical stability.  Today's
              commercially available inorganic membranes have large pores (>40 A), a wide
              pore size distribution and are ideally suited for removing high molecular
              weight components from a liquid stream (ultrafiltration).  However, because
              these membranes operate on Knudsen diffusion, their separation coefficients are
              far too low for use in gas separations.  On the other hand, zeolite membranes
              have much smaller pores and a well defined pore size distribution.  since they
              separate molecules by molecular sieving, they offer very high selectivity. 
              Unfortunately, while the potential of zeolite membranes has long been
              recognized, there is still no suitable processing method by which either dense
              free standing or supported membranes can be made.    In Phase I, TDA will
              prepare ASM-5 zeolite film on Si)2 and Al2O3 substrates using a novel synthetic
              method, and then characterize the chemical composition, morphology, thermal
              stability and ion-exchange ability of the resulting films.  ***
