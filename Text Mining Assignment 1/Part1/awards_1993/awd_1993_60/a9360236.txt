Abstract    :
              9360236  McElroy  Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is an important worldwide food
              legume,  capable of growing with minimal rainfall and capable of fixing 
              nitrogen.  The crop is often grown in rotation with grains on  nitrogen
              deficient soils.  For the plant to reach maximum  sustainable yields without
              supplemental nitrogen, it must be  inoculated with a Rhizobium and planted
              during winter seasons.   Planting under cool wet conditions, however, subjects
              the crop to  Pythium caused damping-off resulting in serious crop loss.  Seed 
              treatment with chemical fungicides is effective but kills the  Rhizobium. 
              Thus, an alternative method to prevent Pythium caused  damping-off is
              desirable.  This project will examine the  feasibility of using biological
              disease control agents (BDCAs) in  combination with Rhizobium to prevent
              Pythium disease and maximize  the sustainable yield of chickpea.  Greenhouse
              Phase I studies will  test five BDCAs with special chickpea Rhizobium in four
              different  agricultural soils.  If successful, this unique method of 
              preventing Pythium disease could be used in other sustainable food  legume
              crops in the U.S. and worldwide, and therefore, is directly  related to U.S.
              technical and economic competitiveness in  agricultural biotechnology.
