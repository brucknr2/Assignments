Abstract    :
              9360095  Keefe       Drag due to turbulent skin friction substantially 
              penalizes the performance and economics of oil and gas  pipelines.  Using two
              new control ideas originating from  research in nonlinear dynamical systems,
              Nielsen Engineering  and Research (NEAR) has recently used numerical
              simulations  to demonstrate the possibility of 50-60% drag reductions at 
              constant massflux in rectangular channel flow, and proposes  to apply these
              same ideas to drag reduction in circular  pipes.  In rectangular channel flow a
              key ingredient for the  successful application of these controls has been the
              use of  low-drag, nonlinear flow states as goal dynamics.  While  these finite
              amplitude states in channels and boundary  layers have been know for a number
              of years, their existence  in pipe flow has not yet been demonstrated.  In the
              proposed  research Nielsen Engineering intends to demonstrate the  existence of
              nonlinear neutral states in pipe flow, and  calculate their form.  One part of
              the research will make  use of intriguing new theoretical results that suggest
              some  of these finite amplitude states may not be spatially  periodic.  The
              other will use established linear and  nonlinear stability techniques on the
              related problem of  elliptical pipe flow, with the intent of demonstrating a 
              connection between the nonlinear states of this flow and  pipe flow as
              ellipticity decreases.
