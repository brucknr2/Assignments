Abstract    :
              9360931  Henderson       The potential to achieve high insulating value by the
              use of  evacuated glass microspheres has been know for some time.  The  purpose
              of the research is to solve the principal obstacle to their  use, which has
              been the development of a commercially viable  technique to produce evacuated
              microspheres.  If hollow glass  microspheres can be evacuated and coated cost
              effectively their  utility as insulation will extend to the consumer,
              engineering and  industrial markets with attendant large cost savings to these
              users  and major energy savings to the nation.  For example, using vacuum 
              microspheres having highly reflective metal coatings, systems can  be designed
              with R values greater than 800 have been achieved.       The objective of the
              research is to demonstrate a unique  manufacturing concept which does not
              require the use of vacuum  equipment or evacuated chambers.  A new, cost
              effective,  environmentally benign insulation has enormous commercial potential
               by virtue of the improvement in a wide variety of products:  e.g.,  dewars,
              refrigerated trucks and rail cars, home appliances such as  ovens and
              refrigerators, foam insulation, pipe insulation,  vehicles, cryogenic fuel
              containers and packaging.
