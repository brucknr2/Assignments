Abstract    :
              9360754  Morford  The Microsoft Windows NT (New Technology) Operating System 
              will be released in the second half of 1993, and is totally  inaccessible to
              visually impaired students and business  professionals.  This operating system
              will be in many colleges and  universities for science and mathematics courses
              and will severely  hinder the educational and career opportunities for visually
               impaired people.  The goal of the Graphic Access New Technology  (GANT)
              project is to make Windows NT accessible to visually  impaired persons. 
              Automated Functions, Inc. (AFI) will design and  develop software that will
              accurately map the two dimensional  Windows NT graphic display to the one
              dimensional medium of speech.   GANT will use a innovative multiple task
              approach which uses  artificial intelligence pattern matching technology to
              accurately  convert the graphic pattern to text character.  AFI is expert in 
              the design and development of adaptive aids to assist visually  impaired
              people.  The GANT team is familiar with graphic based  operating systems and
              understands the needs of persons with visual  impairments.  A successful GANT
              system will enable visually  impaired people to use the same Windows NT System
              as their sighted  peers, enabling access to mathematics and science related
              courses  and professions without any sighted assistance. ***
