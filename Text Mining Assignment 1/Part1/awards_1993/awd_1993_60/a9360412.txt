Abstract    :
              9360412  Abramovich       In the past decade seismologists have witnessed a
              spectacular  development in seismic instrumentation.  Broad band seismometers 
              now routinely record signals down to milliHertzs with a dynamic  range
              approaching 140dB.  Data collected by these instruments teach  us much about
              the Earth's structure and seismic wave propagation.   However, increasing
              demand to sample the wavefield with a much  higher density cannot be satisfied
              by the use of these very  expensive instruments.  There is a strong need for
              inexpensive,  portable seismometers with a broad band frequency response and 
              dynamic range around 120 dB.       We propose to develop a new seismometer
              based on molecular  electronic technology.  Previous attempts to use this
              technology  have failed, especially in achieving acceptable transfer 
              characteristics and long term parameter stability.  Our preliminary 
              theoretical and experimental studies have yielded new methods of  overcoming
              these problems, which have allowed us to build and  successfully test first
              conceptual prototypes.       Our research would focus on proving the
              feasibility of a  practical implementation of a molecular electronic
              seismometer with  a consistent, broad frequency response and wide dynamic
              range.   These instruments would be compact, rugged (no moving parts), very 
              inexpensive and well fitted for field installation (no precise  equilibration
              required).
