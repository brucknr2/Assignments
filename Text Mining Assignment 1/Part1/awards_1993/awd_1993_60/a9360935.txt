Abstract    :
              9360935  Wise       Three methods are proposed for making net shape high 
              temperature mandrels to form chemically vapor deposited nickel  shell tooling
              based on solid freeform fabrication (SFF) models.   The three methods are
              distinguished by the number of generations or  replications the nickel shell
              will be from the SFF model: three,  two or one.  The three and two generation
              methods use chemically  bonded ceramic materials to form the mandrel because of
              their  compatibility with SFF models coupled with precision, quick and  easy
              formability, thermal stability and thermal conductivity.  The  single
              generation method will require the development of a high  temperature SFF
              model.  The shells formed from these mandrels will  be incorporated into
              injection molds by backing them with CBC and  mounting them in a standard mold
              frame.  The mold will be tested  for part precision and cycle time.       The
              anticipated application of the technology, as defined, is  the tooling industry
              and specifically the matched die molding  industry.  If successful, enhanced
              automation of complex mold  production could improve the worldwide
              competitiveness of the  United States tool and die industry and dramatically
              reduce costs  for any industry that relies on molded parts, particularly those 
              with production runs of less than 25,000 parts.
