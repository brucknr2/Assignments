Abstract    :
              9360087  Ahmed    Technologies based on the injection of lime directly into flue
              gas  ducts in order to control sulfur dioxide show promise as being   simpler
              and less costly than acid-rain control approaches.  Up to  now, typical sulfur
              dioxide removals with lime alone have been low  (40 to 60 percent), and sorbent
              utilizations have been not  satisfactory.    Sorbent Technologies Corporation
              researchers have proposed a  concept to significant improve sulfur dioxide
              remove efficiency and  sorbent utilization.  By coating the lime onto an
              inexpensive  support phase, expanded vermiculite or perlite, and moistening the
               combination slightly before introducing it into the duct, extremely  high
              sulfur dioxide removals were possible.  By recycling the  sorbents, high
              utilizations could be achieved.  The concept was  examined at U.S. SPA's North
              Carolina laboratories with good  results.  This Phase I project will continue
              the proof-of-concept  testing at Sorbtech's laboratories, specifically aimed at
               developing a performance model and testing the model by  characterizing how
              changes in process and sorbent variables affect  sorbent performance.    The
              new technology represents a low-cost solution to the current  acid rain
              problem.  If fully developed, it should be attractive to  utilities and
              industrial firms that burn coal or fuel oil.  ***
