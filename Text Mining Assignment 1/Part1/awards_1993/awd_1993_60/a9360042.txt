Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT --- III-9360042  Zamansky    The PI proposes a novel improvement in
              industrial waste incineration which he claims will solve all problems
              associated with the incineration of halogenated materials.  By the addition of
              Na2CO3 to the feed, he hopes to convert all halogen contained in any
              halogenated organic compound (HOC), including products of incomplete combustion
              (PIC), into the corresponding sodium salt.  Proposal includes experiments and
              calculations to demonstrate this proposed concept.  The important factors
              affecting this process will be identified and attempts will be made to show
              that the process can occur with reaction times, temperatures and other
              conditions which are in the practical range for application to waste
              incineration.  A very important application would be in the aluminum smelting
              industry, where emissions of perfluorinated alkanes can pose a severe
              environmental problem.
