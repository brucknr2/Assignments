Abstract    :
              9360695  Keenan          This  is  a proposal to design a system of interactive 
              video technology for assessing team leadership skills.   The  intended  users
              of the technology are companies who  want  a  better  means  to assess existing
              and potential  leaders  of  self-directed work groups as part of their effort
              to improve  quality   and   productivity  in  their  firms.    Vignettes 
              portraying important dilemmas confronting self-directed work  team leaders
              would be presented in a life-like way via laser  disk,  with individual
              reactions to those dilemmas  recorded  and  used  to  select further vignettes 
              to  be  viewed  and  responded to.  Use of interactive video technology will
              make  it  possible to develop a leadership assessment system which  is   both 
              realistic  and  standardized,  objectives   which  heretofore have seemed
              contradictory.        This  project will contribute to a growing  effort  to 
              improve  the quality and performance of American firms,  and  thus  to  enhance
              national competitiveness.   It  will  also  contribute  to the effort to
              develop practical  applications  from social science research.  ***
