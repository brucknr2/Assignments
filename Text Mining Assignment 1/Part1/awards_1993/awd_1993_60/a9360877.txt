Abstract    :
              9360877  Pierce  Cygnus Laser proposes to replace the semiconductor laser as a
              source for high resolution laser spectroscopy and high precision atomic clocks
              with a compact, all solid state laser source based upon titanium-doped sapphire
              (Ti:S). Recent spectacular improvements in the efficiency and output power of a
              continuous-wave frequency doubled diode pumped Nd:YAG laser has made this
              system feasible in the near term, with attractive overall wall plug efficiency.
               Our quasi monolithic single frequency Ti:S laser is approximately the same
              size as a stabilized single mode diode laser system, but it is intrinsically
              frequency stable, dramatically reducing the complexity and increasing the
              reliability of the active stabilization system.  It will be an ideal source for
              the next generation of atomic clocks and other frequency standards.  ***
