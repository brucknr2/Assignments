Abstract    :
              9360574  Barrett  The project deals with the development of high bandwidth 
              electrical helicopter flight control actuators. The actuators are  based on the
              use of active torque plate concept. Torque plates,  integrated in the blade
              roots, pitch the blades to proper  attitude by twisting. The plate system is
              completely solid state  resulting in a much cleaner hub without swash plates,
              linkages or  bearings. The active  elements have extremely high efficiencies 
              leading to very low power consumption and high break frequencies.  The
              performance of the active plates is predicted using laminated  plate theory.
              Analytical models are refined to accurately account  for torque-plate
              nonlinearities. The performance of torque  elements is compared to hydraulic
              and other electromechanical  actuation systems.  ***
