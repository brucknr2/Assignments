Abstract    :
              9360558  Wang       In the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), a 
              multi-zonal approach greatly simplifies the resolution of  complex geometrical
              details and the application of different  flow physics in different zones of
              the flow domain.  Previous multi-zonal patched and overlapped approaches 
              suffered from one or both of the following problems.  In the  proposed
              approach, one of the overlapping boundaries is used  to divide the physical
              flow domain into non-overlapping  regions and flux conservation is enforced on
              this  overlapping boundary locally and globally.  The proposed  approach
              unifies the treatment for arbitrarily patched and  overlapped meshes.  The
              interpolation of flow variables from  one zone to another is not necessary. 
              The proposed approach  is fully conservative, highly accurate, suitable for
              both  steady and unsteady flow problems and easy to implement in 
              finite-difference/finite volume CFD codes.       In Phase I, the proposed
              methodology will be  implemented and assessed for several 2D and 3D problems 
              without relative mesh movement.  Further extension to  viscous flow and
              unsteady flow with relative mesh movement  and implementation of the proposed
              methodology in a  production-level flow analysis code will be carried out in 
              Phase II.
