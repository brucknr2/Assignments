Abstract    :
              9360530  Owen  This research program involves an autonomous and adaptive subsea 
              sensor that measures very-near seafloor fluid flows, suspended  particulates,
              and momentum exchanges in the coastal environment.   We use computer-aided
              speckle interferometry to deduce a two-  dimensional flow field from
              particulate speckle patterns.   Particulates are sampled through long-distance
              microscopy.  The  sensor has a temporal resolution greater than 33 ms over sub-
               millimeter to meter scales.  The system includes a laser,  microprocessor,
              video cameras, optics, and a recorder.  Power  requirements are low--the sensor
              operates autonomously for  months.  We conserve power with neural networks--the
              sensor  monitors environmental changes and samples accordingly.
