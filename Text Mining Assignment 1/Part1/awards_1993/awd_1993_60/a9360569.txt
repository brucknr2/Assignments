Abstract    :
              9360569  Hansen    The objective of this research is the adaptation of thermal 
              field-flow fractionation technology to high temperatures for  the separation of
              ultra-high molecular weight polymers.  The  basic technique discriminates among
              polymer molecules on the  basis of molecular weight as the polymer solution
              undergoes  laminar channel flow between a hot and cold wall.   Macromolecules
              move toward the cold wall by thermal diffusion  while ordinary diffusion tends
              to cause the lower molecular  weight species to migrate to the higher velocity
              regions.   Detector output versus time can be related to the molecular  weight
              distribution.         Polymers are widely used in automotive, electronics,
              medical  and other industries.  Performance of the polymers in these  products
              often depends on the physical characterization which  is in turn affected by
              the composition of the polymer.  The  instrumention system will to maintain and
              improve product  quality by providing information about polymer composition in 
              polymer systems at and beyond the capabilities of current  methods.  ***
