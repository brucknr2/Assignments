              III-9360901  EIC Laboratories Inc.  Timothy L. Rose    ABSTRACT    This Phase I
              project involves the synthesis of a monmeric perfluorinates ester of a
              superacid (perfluorovinylmoniliformin methyl ester), its polymerization and the
              characterization of the resulting polymer.  Formation of ionomer membranes with
              this unique polymer may overcome certain disadvantages of the highly successful
              commercial membranes with this successful commercial membranes containing
              fluoropolymers with sulfonic acid groups.    These types of membranes are used
              in processes like electrodialysis for the treatment of waste streams,
              production of chemicals, and water purification.  The new structures to be
              prepared in this research may improve the performance of such membranes in
              these and other important industrial and environmental processes.
