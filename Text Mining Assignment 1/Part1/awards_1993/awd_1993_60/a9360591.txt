Abstract    :
              9360591  Jiang    While the recent discovery of fullerene carbon has led to
              intense research activity and many proposed applications, most of the work to
              date has focused on C60, and to a lesser extent, CC0.  The higher fullerenes
              (C76,  C78, C84, etc.) which may have significantly different and useful
              properties, have not been evaluated because they are difficult to obtain in
              purified form.  In this project, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) will develop improved
              routes to the higher fullerenes and investigate their potential applications. 
              In Phase I, we will optimize our combustion synthesis process (developed with
              NSF support in previous SBIR project) for the production of higher fullerenes.
              We will purify the higher fullerenes by high-pressure liquid chromatography
              (HPLC).  To minimize the cost of  higher fullerenes in future applications, TDA
              had identified several different separation methods which do not involve
              chromatography.  Using the pure materials from chromatography, we will measure
              fundamental properties of the higher fullerenes which are relevant to our
              proposed separation methods.  We will carry out an engineering and market
              analysis to determine the most desirable future applications of the higher
              fullerenes.  Because TDA is already a manufacturer of combustion derived
              fullerenes we will be able to immediately commercialize the technology for
              producing and separating the higher fullerenes.  ***
