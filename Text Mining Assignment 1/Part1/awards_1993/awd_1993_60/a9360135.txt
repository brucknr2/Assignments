Abstract    :
              9360135  Lee       Due to the effectiveness of fibrous materials in  suppressing
              radiative energy transport, they are widely used  for thermal insulation in
              many engineering systems, such as  the space shuttle thermal protection tiles,
              liners of  combustion engines, flexible heat shields in reentry  vehicles, etc.
               Of particular interest is the fabric  insulation which consists of fiber
              bundles woven into a  matrix formation.  The woven fabric is a high-strength 
              composite particularly suited for applications at elevated  temperatures. 
              Continual improvement in the insulation  capacity of fabric composites is
              needed in order to  accommodate the increasingly severe thermal environments of
               future aerospace and combustion systems.       The purpose of the proposed
              research is to develop  analytical models for the design and performance 
              optimization of fabric composites.  Phase 1 focuses on the  modeling and
              characterization of the radiative properties of  the constituent fiber bundles,
              whereas the model for  predicting radiative heat transfer will be developed in 
              Phase 2.  These models are powerful design tools which can  be used to
              determine the composition, engineer the radiative  properties, and optimize the
              thermal performance of fabric  composites in a cost-effective manner.
