Abstract    :
              9360656  Flores  Only a small number of persons are trained to transcribe
              Braille  music to the printed form.  The conversion is a manual process, 
              thereby limiting the access that blind musicians have to printed  music.  The
              purpose of the planned investigation is to develop a  computer-aided (PC
              Windows environment) Braille music  transcription system which will automate
              the process and allow  individuals with little training in the Braille music
              code to  transcribe printed music into Braille.  The translator to be 
              developed would also provide the capability to a blind musician  to enter
              Braille music code and produce sheet music for use by  sighted musicians. 
              Success in developing a computer-aided  transcription will meet an important
              need.  ***
