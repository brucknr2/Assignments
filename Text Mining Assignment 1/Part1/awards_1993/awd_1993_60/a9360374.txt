Abstract    :
              9360374  Asawa  The goal of the Phase I research is to design, fabricate and
              test a new type of planar waveguide bimodal launcher which is able to launch
              low order data modes and high order monitor modes simultaneously into graded
              index optical fiber for use in a secure communication link.  Graded-index fiber
              links have wide bandwidth and high security capabilities.  Three launchers will
              be fabricated and tested for security and stability performance.  The launchers
              will have increased capabilities with two feedback channels and an additional
              channel for performing OTDR diagnostics of the fiber link.  The feedback
              channels will be used to stabilize the data and monitor diodes and OTDR channel
              will be used to determine the health of the fiber optic link and also to
              pinpoint the point of intrusion when it occurs.  The waveguide launcher has a
              potential for low cost in production due to photolithographic preparation of
              the waveguides and for thermal and mechanical stability due to no moveable
              mechanical adjustments.  ***
