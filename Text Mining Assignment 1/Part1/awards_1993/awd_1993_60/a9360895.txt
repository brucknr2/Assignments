Abstract    :
              9360895  Dixon    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in
              the general area of analytical  chemistry and in the subfield of infrared
              spectroscopic instrumentation. Tunable diode laser  spectrometers based on lead
              salt diodes are capable of measuring part per billion concentrations  over an
              absorption path of a few meters but require cryogenic cooling. The objective of
              the  Phase I research is the design of a diode-laser-based intracavity
              difference frequency generator  tunable in the 3.2-3.5 micrometer range. By
              combining the difference frequency generator with  FM modulation detection it
              should be possible in Phase II studies to build a tunable diode laser 
              spectrometer capable at operating at room temperature rather than the cryogenic
              temperatures  now required.  %%%  High resolution diode laser spectrometers
              capable of operating at room temperature are expected  to find numerous
              applications in trace gas detection, biomedical applications, analysis of
              complex  gas mixtures and industrial process monitoring and safety.  ***
