Abstract    :
              This project is upgrading the laboratory component of optics by                
              introducing current instrumentation related to setting up and                  
              testing erbium-doped fiber optical amplifiers and distributed                  
              feedback lasers.  Students are characterizing the output of a                  
              distributed feedback laser by measuring it output power,                       
              linearity, central wavelength, and spectral width using power                  
              meters, monochromators, and scanning interferometers.  They are                
              assembling and testing an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)                  
              system.  Using a leveled sine-wave generator as a driving                      
              source or an LED and a DFB laser, appropriate detector and a                   
              wide bandwidth oscilloscope, they are measuring amplification                  
              and linearity of the EDFA for a range of signal strengths.                     
              They are also measuring bit error rate using a BERT driving a                  
              DFB laser source, sending a signal through a length of fiber                   
              with and without amplification by an EDFA.  Finally, they are                  
              using two DFB lasers as sources to make a narrowly-spaced (in                  
              wavelength) wavelength division multiplexer which inputs its                   
              signal to an EDFA before the demultiplexing stage.  All                        
              instruments are representative of those which a technician                     
              working with fiber optics uses.
