Abstract    :
              Students are using a computer classroom as an integral part of                 
              their learning environment to discover mathematical principles                 
              and concepts, to analyze models of real world problems, and to                 
              gain a better appreciation of program development.  Students                   
              are working with their own experimental data from the science                  
              laboratories.  An instructional command center gives the                       
              instructor control over the classroom environment and enables                  
              the student to interact through the computer with the                          
              instructor and with other students in the classroom, making                    
              computer group work a reality.   The project also enables the                  
              institution to provide computer accessibility for the                          
              physically challenged.
