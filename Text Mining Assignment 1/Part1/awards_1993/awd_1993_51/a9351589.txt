Abstract    :
              9351589  Keefe  The main goal of this project is to improve the learning, 
              retention and application of physics principles and concepts by  students
              studying physics at Clatsop Community College (CCC).  This is being
              accomplished by incorporating a series of new  investigations using
              contemporary computer technology into the  curriculum.  Microcomputers are used
              to perform data collection  and graphing in the areas of force, motion,
              temperature, and  radiation. The microcomputers are used to provide immediate 
              feedback for student analysis of data, which stimulates them to  experiment on
              their own with a larger number and variety of  trials, to discover relations in
              the physical world.  Six  networked Microcomputer Based Labs (MBLs) have been
              obtained,  all of which are equipped with a Universal Lab Interface (ULl), 
              appropriate sensors and software.  A master MBL station  equipped with a high
              resolution Monitor, SuperDrive, modem and  power source has also been obtained.
              This equipment is  revitalizing the physics and Integrated Technologies
              programs  at CCC, and is providing the necessary technology to further  the
              college's stated mission to prepare physics students to  meet the challenges of
              science in the next century.  This  project is encouraging students to continue
              to study and  support science by improving their experiences with physics.
