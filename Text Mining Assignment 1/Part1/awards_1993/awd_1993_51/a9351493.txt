Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory is being used for the instruction of                     
              biomathematics and biological statistics. This laboratory                      
              setting serves the following major purposes:                                   
                                                                                             
              1)   Makes mathematical concepts and tools more understandable,                
                   more enjoyable and more useful for biological sciences                    
                   majors.                                                                   
              2)   Makes advanced mathematical modelling more accessible to                  
                   undergraduates.                                                           
              3)   Allows the use of real and realistic case studies in our                  
                   entire set of undergraduate course offerings.                             
              4)   Enables advanced undergraduate majors in Statistics and                   
                   Biometry to participate more fully in the research program                
                   of the Unit.                                                              
              5)   Promotes mathematical literacy rather than easily                         
                   forgotten technical skills.                                               
              6)   Exposes undergraduate majors who are participating in the                 
                   Teacher Education in Science and Mathematics program to                   
                   the use of mathematics and mathematical computing in                      
                   biology.
