Abstract    :
              9351871  Dick  The Department of Geology is incorporating a refraction 
              seismograph, earth resistivity equipment, a laptop personal  computer, and
              supporting geophysical processing and  interpretation software into a
              sophomore-level course entitled  Subsurface Investigations.  In addition, the
              instructional  facilities of Applied Geophysics, an existing advanced level 
              course, are being improved.  Subsurface Investigations is being  developed in
              order to introduce students to the various methods  of subsurface investigation
              used in environmental geology  problems.  The objective of the course is to
              stimulate student  interest in geology, physics, and chemistry by integrating 
              these scientific disciplines in an applied geology course.  The  objective of
              Applied Geophysics is to provide students with  hands-on experience in
              conducting geophysical surveys and  interpreting geophysical data.    ***
