Abstract    :
              9351386  Hudleston   A new Geodynamics Laboratory is being created within the 
              Department of Geology and Geophysics.  This laboratory is for  experimentation
              on processes of fundamental importance in  various areas of the Earth Sciences,
              representing a variety of  fields but all falling under the general rubric of
              continuum  mechanics. Experimental topics include flow of water in open 
              channels, porous media, lakes, and rotating basins; flow of  complex geological
              materials such as debris; deformation of  plastic materials in two and three
              dimensions; and plate motion  on a fluid undergoing three-dimensional
              convection.  The  experiments are being coupled with computer models of the 
              processes studied.The laboratory is a unique complement to the  more
              traditional sample-oriented laboratories in our and other  Earth Sciences
              Departments.  It is giving students a unique  opportunity to visualize and
              manipulate models of processes  that they previously studied about mainly
              through lectures.   Also, by grouping these experiments in one place, using 
              generic, simple materials, and incorporating them in  fundamental courses
              taught at the beginning of the  undergraduate curriculum, the new laboratory is
              helping  students appreciate the unity of the physics underlying many 
              apparently diverse geologic processes.   ***
