Abstract    :
              This project will enhance UAB's undergraduate program in                       
              computerscience by creating a new telecommunications laboratory                
              to support a new specialization in telecommunications. The                     
              term"telecommunications" is used in the broad sense to include                 
              currentconcepts of information networking and distributed                      
              computing,especially client-server heterogeneous applications.
