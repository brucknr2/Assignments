Abstract    :
              Geographic information systems (GIS) is an area of study                       
              causing increased excitement among students. This project,                     
              therefore, strives to enhance this area of geography by                        
              accomplishing specific objectives to improve the curriculum.                   
              New undergraduate courses, internships, and programs are being                 
              added, and a specific plan has been developed for enhancing                    
              four analytical geography courses. This plan also involves                     
              redesigning courses, updating laboratory computing and digital                 
              data analysis equipment, and redesigning laboratory exercises                  
              to incorporate the use of new analytical capabilities. It is                   
              also expected that the physical geography curriculum will be                   
              improved by incorporating modern image display and geographic                  
              information analysis capabilities into existing laboratory and                 
              field exercises.
