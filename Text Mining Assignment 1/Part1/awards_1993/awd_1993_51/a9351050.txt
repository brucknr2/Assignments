Abstract    :
              9351050  Rhodes                               This project is designed to
              address specific curricular  deficiencies which exist in the Biology Department
              at Franklin  College. Using a nationally normed exam and a critical review  of
              Senior Seminar performances, we have found that our students  frequently lack
              the ability to carefully design experiments and  critically analyze their
              results. This deficiency is most  conspicuous in areas of cellular and
              organismal physiology  where concepts of Chemistry and Physics need to be
              applied to  laboratory data in order to arrive at meaningful  interpretations.
              A developmental program, starting in the  Freshman year, was initiated in an
              attempt to address our  concerns. However, in order to continue our program in
              the  Sophomore and Junior level Physiology courses, new  instrumentation and
              data processing equipment is urgently  needed. To this end, we intend to
              install 7 computer  workstations in our Physiology lab. In conjunction with 
              physiological transducers, simulation software and data  analysis software,
              these workstations will provide an  integrated system for teaching experimental
              design, data  acquisition, and methods of critical data analysis. The new 
              equipment will also provide our students with the means for  studying
              electrophysiology (nerve and muscle tissues) and  pursuing more sophisticated
              research projects in the area of  physiology.
