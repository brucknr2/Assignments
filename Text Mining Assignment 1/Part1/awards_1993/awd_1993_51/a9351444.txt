Abstract    :
              Instrumentation for Improving Environmental Science Laboratory                 
              Instruction                                                                    
                  The primary purpose of this project is to improve the                      
              curricula in environmental science and microbiology laboratory                 
              instruction at the institution. Improvements center on six                     
              undergraduate laboratory courses that form the core of                         
              curricula for a new environmental science major and a                          
              microbiology major. Specific project equipment also allows for                 
              greater focus of laboratory time on concepts and hands-on use                  
              of modern instruments. It is expected that these project                       
              improvements will also make science more appealing, and more                   
              understandable for undergraduates.
