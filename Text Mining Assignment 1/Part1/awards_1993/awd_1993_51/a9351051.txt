Abstract    :
              9351051  Reeves      A Gemini 200 NMR with capabilities for both proton and
              carbon  spectra is being used in the sophomore organic course,  instrumental
              analysis, physical chemistry, spectroscopy, and  undergraduate research.  Work
              stations are providing the multi-  user capabilities needed for successful
              undergraduate classroom  (laboratory) teachings.  Initially, students are
              developing the  ability to handle the computer-interfaced NMR instrument and to
               analyze proton, carbon, and 2-D spectra.  They are continuing  on to carry out
              more complex NMR experiments and to use the  instrument in their senior
              research projects.   ***
