Abstract    :
              The Department of Bioengineering at Syracuse University has                    
              introduced a Biomechanics Track option for majors. This track                  
              is unique, no other undergraduate program offers an 'in depth'                 
              three course sequence focussed on skeletomuscular Biomechanics.                
              We are using a 'layered' approach, combining theory with                       
              laboratory applications to real problems. The Track begins with                
              an Introductory Course and ends with a required Senior Thesis.                 
              To support our educational goals, we will purchase 'student-                   
              friendly', durable equipment modules for mechanical testing of                 
              biomaterials, measurement of strain and muscle activity (EMG),                 
              for whole body and joint motion analysis, to measure static and                
              dynamic body forces (force plate) and to support Finite Element                
              Method analysis of skeletal elements and prosthetic designs.                   
              These modules will replace existing fragile research equipment                 
              which forces faculty to demonstrate rather than lets students                  
              experiment. The modules can be 'mixed and matched' to give                     
              great flexibility for advanced student projects. We see this as                
              a model for such Programs.
