Abstract    :
              Improvement Of Undergraduate Laboratories In Plant Physiology                  
              and Ecophysiology                                                              
              This project will provide for the modernization and                            
              restructuring of the laboratory course in Plant Physiology. The                
              course itself is the major plant science course in the                         
              departmental core curriculum, and will permit undergraduates to                
              employ modern techniques that are currently used in research.                  
              The equipment is also being used in two additional courses on                  
              physiological plant adaptations, in which undergraduates design                
              their own experiments.  The project is also expected to impact                 
              other courses in independent undergraduate research.
