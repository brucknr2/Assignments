Abstract    :
              9351550  Jones       The College has acquired new astronomical instrumentation
              for  the school's Boller & Chivens 16" research grade cassegrain  telescope to
              be used by the undergraduate students for  instruction and research. A Star I
              CCD (Charge Coupled Device)  from Photometrics along with an IBM-XT controlling
              computer and  software, a wide-band filter set (UBVRI) and filter wheel for 
              stellar photometry, and a spectrograph for astronomical  spectroscopy are being
              used. An upper division project oriented  observational astronomy course is
              being implemented using this  equipment and an existing SUN workstation network
              with the IRAF  data reduction package. A partial objective of the 
              observational course is to supply observational data for  integration into the
              introductory astronomy labs. The  introductory astronomy students have the
              opportunity to see how  these observations are obtained at the telescope,
              enhancing the  educational value of the labs which use the locally obtained 
              data. The general public also has the chance to see modern  observing
              techniques demonstrated on public viewing nights.  Finally, the equipment is
              being used in student research, and  there is the possibility of joint projects
              with other schools  with similar facilities.  ***
