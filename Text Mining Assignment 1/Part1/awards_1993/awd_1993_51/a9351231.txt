Abstract    :
              Hamilton College offers undergraduates a strong program in                     
              experimental psychology and related areas of cognitive science.                
              Students engage in increasingly sophisticated scientific work                  
              in their courses, independent studies, and senior projects. The                
              proposed ILI project will enhance this experience in Cognition                 
              and related areas (Linguistics, Computer Science, and Music) by                
              providing a Macintosh computer laboratory for the cognitive                    
              courses that will also serve as a center for cognitive study to                
              promote interdisciplinary study on campus. To complement the                   
              hardware we will develop flexible tools for student research                   
              using Psyscope, a newly-developed program for experimental                     
              control.  New equipment will permit significant revisions of                   
              the curriculum in advanced cognitive courses and independent                   
              research. Improvements in resources will also allow students in                
              psychology and related fields at Hamilton and elsewhere to                     
              engage in progressively more sophisticated and independent                     
              scientific projects, and help to ignite enthusiasm for pursuing                
              careers in science.
