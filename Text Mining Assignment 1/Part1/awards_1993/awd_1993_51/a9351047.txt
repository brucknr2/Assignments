Abstract    :
              Incorporation of Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry and                      
              Fluorescence Spectroscopy into the Environmental Science                       
              Program.  The project will purchase a new computer driven data                 
              station to upgrade the GC/MS spectrometer and a                                
              spectrofluorometer.  The equipment will improve the recently                   
              initiated Environmental Science Program by strengthening the                   
              laboratory portion of introductory and advanced chemistry                      
              courses.  The rationale for these acquisitions is twofold: 1)                  
              to support interest development and early experimentation in                   
              environmental science, and 2) to modernize the introductory and                
              advanced chemistry laboratory program. The instrumentation is                  
              vital to the long range plan to offer students modern                          
              instrumental laboratory experiences and to reinforce their                     
              interest in considering science as a career.
