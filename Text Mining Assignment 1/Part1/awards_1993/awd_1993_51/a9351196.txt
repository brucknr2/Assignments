Abstract    :
              The project will purchase computer equipment to introduce                      
              computer-aided molecular modeling into the undergraduate                       
              chemistry curriculum.  Students will develop the ability to                    
              view and manipulate 3-dimensional molecular structures in a                    
              variety of formats as applied to organic and biomolecular                      
              structure. Ultimately, the approach will extend throughout the                 
              curriculum. In the context of discovery-based problem and                      
              laboratory assignments, students will build molecular models on                
              these systems and submit the data files over the network for                   
              computational analysis. They will employ the workstations'                     
              graphics capabilities to analyze their results. In the process,                
              they will put this tool to the same exploratory uses as does                   
              the research chemist: to better understand structure, and to                   
              predict and rationalize molecular reactivities.
