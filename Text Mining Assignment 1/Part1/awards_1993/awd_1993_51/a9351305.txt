Abstract    :
              9351305  Tobochnik                            A teachers resource guide is being
              developed for faculty teaching  a model laboratory-based course on computer
              simulation which will  fundamentally alter the nature of the first two years of
              the  undergraduate physics curriculum. This guide will include carefully 
              developed and tested problems, sample programs, explanations of the  relevant
              physics and algorithms, typical results, extensive  reference lists, and
              suggestions for teachers. These materials also  will provide guidance to
              teachers with limited experience in using  computer simulations so that they
              can use the discovery method of  teaching and provide direction to students
              without undue time spent  on course preparation. Topics will be chosen that
              give students  opportunities to develop their conceptual understanding of the 
              principles of physics, motivate them to learn more physics, and  apply the
              principles of physics to other sciences and engineering.  Funds are requested
              for release time, computers, student stipends,  and travel. The principal
              investigators have extensive experience  in incorporating computers into the
              physics curriculum, and the  proposed work will have national and international
              impact.
