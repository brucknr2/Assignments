Abstract    :
              This project has established a course for biology students                     
              using modern instrumentation to characterize physical                          
              environments and responses of plants to them. Students  master                 
              the instruments in supervised laboratory exercises, then use                   
              each instrument to characterize the "natural" environment or                   
              plant responses in tropical, desert and mesic areas of a large                 
              multi-room greenhouse. Factors that are measured include                       
              temperature, air velocity, humidity, soil moisture status, and                 
              radiation quantity.                                                            
              This program is helping students become more aware of the                      
              physical environment and its biological consequences. The                      
              project is also allowing students to acquire proficiency in the                
              choice and operation of modern instruments and research in this                
              field.
