Abstract    :
              9351910  Rogers  We have acquired a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for use 
              by undergraduates in supervised laboratory course work, in  classroom
              demonstrations and for scheduled use in undergraduate  independent research
              projects.  The STM offers new and  dramatically better ways to introduce
              students to the physics  of materials and to the basic quantum mechanical
              nature of our  world.  However, because the STM technique is quite new, its 
              use in physics and chemistry courses is extremely rare.  We are  harnessing the
              instructional potential of STM by integrating it  into our undergraduate
              curriculum.  We are initially  implementing this plan in three specific ways. 
              First, we  introduce a set of quantitative STM experiments for use in our 
              senior level experimental laboratory course.  We are designing  a laboratory
              section in which the students explore quantum  mechanical tunneling and learn
              how it can be used to study the  properties of materials.  Second, we are
              developing two  classroom demonstrations which use the STM to illustrate the 
              atomic structure of surfaces and molecules respectively.   Third, we are
              tapping the potential of STM for high quality  hands-on research experience for
              undergraduates by scheduling  the use of the STM for undergraduate independent
              research  projects.  We believe that it is important to bring modern  research
              results into the classroom as soon as it is practical  to do so.  We are
              integrating the new field of molecular  imaging and manipulation into our
              curriculum to give students  a more concrete understanding both of our physical
              world and  the fundamental principles underlying modern technology.  ***
