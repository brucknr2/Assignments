Abstract    :
              9351762  Urbanczyk  The University is a small, public institution that serves a 
              vast, sparsely populated region of west Texas, ideally located  in a natural
              laboratory within the Chihuahuan desert and near  Big Bend National Park and
              the Big Bend Ranch State Natural  Area. The aim of this project is to improve
              access to this  natural laboratory for students who otherwise would never 
              experience it. The "treasures" of the public lands in the  region are river
              canyons, and the major instruments to be  purchased in this project is
              equipment for improved access to  these canyons. The significance of this
              project is to provide  an avenue for the integration of field experience into 
              classroom instruction. This is particularly important for the  largely Hispanic
              population of the region, many of whom have  never ventured into the National
              or State parks in the area,  let alone into the isolated river canyons. The
              Chihuahuan  desert is a pristine natural environment that provides an 
              excellent classroom for the study of Geology and Biology.  ***
