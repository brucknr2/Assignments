Abstract    :
              With funds from a private donor the University of Nebraska                     
              department of Physics and Astronomy has been able to purchase                  
              a CCD with photometric head and a computer. It is not able to                  
              be used to its full potential because the telescope which the                  
              department has on campus is inadequate.  In this project a                     
              permanently mounted 16" Cassegrain/Newtonian telescope is used                 
              to allow the CCD system to be permanently mounted and readily                  
              available for use by a wide range of classes. The telescope                    
              allows long exposures which let undergraduates get hands on                    
              experience observing just about every class of astrophysical                   
              object. This enhances the astrophysics major program in the                    
              following three ways: first, it greatly improves the teaching                  
              of observational techniques by allowing students to try things                 
              on their own and at their own pace; second, it allows the easy                 
              introduction of relevant observational activities into all of                  
              the other courses for majors; and third, it lets students carry                
              out an enormous range of independent research projects with                    
              relatively little supervision.
