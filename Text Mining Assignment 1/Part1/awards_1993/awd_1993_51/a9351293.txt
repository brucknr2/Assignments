Abstract    :
              9351293  Edwards  A long-term goal of Texas Southern University's Department of 
              Biology is to develop and maintain a modern and well equipped  molecular
              biology teaching laboratory that provides state-of-  the-art training
              opportunities for undergraduate students who  intend to pursue careers in
              health science fields, including  teaching, research, and medicine. This
              application requests  funds to purchase micro and high-speed centrifuges,
              equipment  for organelle isolation and genome analysis for teaching a 
              laboratory course in "Experimentation in Recombinant DNA  Technology, Genome
              Analysis, and Cell Mapping" to supplement  and clarify the theory taught in
              Cell and Molecular Biology  courses. The laboratory experience is mandatory in
              preparing  minority students for graduate and professional schools, and  for
              careers in college and precollege teaching.  The new  equipment will allow
              students to develop experience in the  preparation of plasmids and plasmid DNA,
              fractionation of  subcellular organelles and preparation of genomic and Lambda 
              DNA; to amplify DNA molecules for sequencing and cloning in  plasmid vectors,
              and produce libraries of genomic DNA; to  isolate Restriction Enzyme digests,
              separate DNA fragments,  isolate chromosome-size DNA molecules, sequence cloned
              DNA  fragments and DNA isolated directly from agarose gels. Not only  is this
              equipment essential for teaching the proposed  laboratory course, it will also
              provide a facility for training  other undergraduate students in
              state-of-the-art methods in  biochemical and molecular biology procedures.  ***
