Abstract    :
              Electrophysiology workstations are being used to assist in the                 
              teaching of human, rodent and avian physiology. More                           
              specifically, the workstations are used in labs associated with                
              a course in electrophysiological reactions to psychological                    
              stimuli. These facilities are also used for independent or                     
              senior thesis research by undergraduate students. This project                 
              is expected to enhance current facilities and enable the                       
              presentation of electrophysiological research using a hands-on                 
              approach. Students also work with state-of-the-art facilities,                 
              have a better understanding of human physiology and are                        
              encouraged to pursue research careers.
