Abstract    :
              9351390  Sirvatka    This project is involving students with methods of data 
              assimilation and presentation early in their study of  meteorology.  A Local
              Area Network (LAN) is being established  to facilitate optimum acquisition of
              data, and to allow for  student access to the LAN and all its data.  A RISC 
              Workstation, three PCs and a laptop PC are providing the core  of the LAN,
              while a laser printer and a video projection system  are allowing for effective
              presentation.  The proposed  equipment is enabling majors and nonmajors to
              immerse  themselves in laboratory experiences that are supplementing  classroom
              instruction in every course in the meteorology  curriculum.  Practical
              operation with emphasis on forecasting  and investigation of current research
              findings is heightening  students' critical thinking ability and instilling the
              process  of scientific thinking into the educational experience.   Students
              also are having the opportunity to apply the skills  learned in laboratory in
              cooperation with forecasting done by  the Northeast Illinois Severe Weather
              Spotter Network.         ***
