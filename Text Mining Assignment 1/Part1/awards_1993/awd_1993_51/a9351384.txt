Abstract    :
              9351384  Garver  An automated stage system for fission-track dating is being 
              used by undergraduate students.  Fission-track dating involves  determining the
              density of fossil tracks that have occurred  naturally over time in either
              zircon or apatite crystals.   Additionally, however, one needs to determine the
              amount of  uranium in the crystal because track density is proportional to  age
              and uranium concentration.  This is accomplished by placing  a mica flake over
              the sample and irradiating the sample to  produce spontaneous tracks; the
              density of spontaneous tracks  on the mica flake is proportional to the uranium
              concentration.   The automated stage quickly and precisely moves the microscope
               stage with an absolute accuracy of  10  m.  Given this  considerable time
              savings and ease of use, we are introducing  fission-track dating into our
              Geochemistry classes with  projects in which students date prepared samples and
              interpret  their significance.  Additionally, the system is being used 
              extensively in our senior thesis program.  ***y
