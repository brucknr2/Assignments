Abstract    :
              9351380  Hayes       The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the
              University  of Massachusetts at Amherst is increasing the number of  students
              taught in the innovative mainstream calculus course,  Calculus in a Real and
              Complex World. The basic philosophy of  this course, which was developed with
              NSF support, is to  introduce the students to calculus as an experimental
              science  using the computer algebra system (CAS) Mathematica. The  computer
              enables the student to solve real and engaging  problems.  An estimated 600
              students per semester will be  taught in this alternative course, which is
              about half the  students who now take the traditional course.        ***
