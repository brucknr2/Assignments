Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department will purchase computers and software for              
              molecular modeling, electronic modeling, data manipulation,                    
              graphing, interfacing hardware, and output devices. This equipment             
              will be used to transform the traditional introductory chemistry               
              course to an innovative, interactive approach to the discipline.               
              The goals are to promote the following: (l) more student discovery             
              of chemical trends and relationships, (2) more student decisions               
              about the chemical questions being asked and the data being                    
              collected, (3) more student/ instructor interaction.   The                     
              equipment will acquire and manipulate data, simulate experiments,              
              chemical reactions, and other dynamic processes, and serve as a                
              chemical tutor.. The creative use of these attributes of the                   
              computer will blur the distinction between lecture and laboratory.
