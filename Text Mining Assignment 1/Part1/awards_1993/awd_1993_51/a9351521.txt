Abstract    :
              The institution provides a liberal arts freshman and sophomore                 
              curriculum. More than half of the students are older and                       
              returning to school or are rural, first-generation college                     
              students. This project, therefore, provides computers and                      
              associated physiological recording equipment and software that                 
              helps undergraduate instruction in biology.  The software                      
              programs developed have also allowed faculty to prepare printed                
              and Hypercard-based tutorial material custom-designed to the                   
              backgrounds of our students. It is expected that this project                  
              will enhance the laboratory experience of our traditional                      
              students and tap the currently underutilized capabilities of                   
              our large non-traditional population at the institution.
