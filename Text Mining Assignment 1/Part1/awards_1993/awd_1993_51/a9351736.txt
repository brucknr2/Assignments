Abstract    :
              This project is part of an on-going effort to improve the                      
              water-related courses in the Civil Engineering curriculum.                     
              Several strategies for improving the introductory courses so                   
              that issues that are relevant in terms of course content,                      
              delivery systems and the inclusion of state-of-the-art                         
              engineering design and analysis tools have been identified.                    
              These strategies include: a) the reorganization of the                         
              curriculum to provide a more effective sequencing of courses;                  
              b) the inclusion of new courses in the curriculum; c) the                      
              development of a Laboratory course in Hydrology; d) the                        
              addition of a Hydraulics course -- with Lab as co-requisite --                 
              taught within the Civil Engineering Department to replace a                    
              similar Fluid Mechanics course -- taught as a service course.                  
              This project specifcially develops the laboratory course by                    
              combining classical experiments and multimedia computer-based                  
              modules to enhance student understanding.
