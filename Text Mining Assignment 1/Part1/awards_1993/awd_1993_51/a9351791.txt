Abstract    :
              Fuzzy logic is a very rapidly growing technical domain. In an                  
              effort to keep our undergraduate students current in this                      
              application field, Milwaukee School of Engineering is                          
              developing a laboratory for the study of fuzzy logic and its                   
              applications. This laboratory will be used primarily for the                   
              course Fuzzy Sets and Applications and in senior projects for                  
              electrical, computer, and biomedical engineering. To a lesser                  
              extent this laboratory will also support courses in virtually                  
              every other major at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. The                  
              equipment and software required should be capable of supporting                
              a broad range of fuzzy logic applications such as control,                     
              information retrieval, semantic analysis, robotics, decision                   
              systems, and image recognition. The major equipment requested                  
              consists of a graphical shell for fuzzy computations, expert                   
              systems shell, computation acceleration boards, and                            
              developmental cross-compilers as well as the platform on which                 
              to run the applications. Through appropriate use of these tools                
              students should be capable of studying the semantic nature of                  
              fuzzy sets, the use of expert and decision-making systems, the                 
              development of control systems using common sense knowledge,                   
              and the application of fuzzy logic to image recognition,                       
              robotics, and information retrieval. Significant impact from                   
              this laboratory is expected curriculum-wide as fuzzy logic and                 
              its applications continue to pervade industry.
