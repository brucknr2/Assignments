Abstract    :
              9351943  Mikkelson   In order to provide our students with an effective
              environment  in which to develop graphics and image processing programs, a 
              system consisting of a graphics workstation and four X-  Terminals is
              requested. This equipment will allow our Computer  Graphics course to shift its
              emphasis from low-level algorithms  for generating graphical output primitives
              and GKS to higher-  level problems dealing with three dimensional graphics,
              PHIGS  and animation. A collection of tools for building an effective 
              graphical interface based on standard software in an  instructional setting
              will be designed.The equipment requested  will also allow our Image Processing
              students to experiment  with the relevant algorithms interactively. An image
              processing  "workbench" will be developed to serve as an interactive  framework
              within which our students will implement their  programming assignments. This
              will facilitate learning by  providing an interactive environment for
              experimenting with the  algorithms and yet allow the students to focus on the
              basic  principles and algorithms involved without spending excessive  amounts
              of time in the image processing course on the overall  interactive program
              design.  ***
