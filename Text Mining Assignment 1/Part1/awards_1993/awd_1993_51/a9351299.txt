Abstract    :
              A Computer Modeling Facility                                                   
              The project will purchase computer equipment to develop a                      
              facility for molecular modeling.  The facility will encompass                  
              all levels of the instructional program, and touch all students                
              passing through the chemistry curriculum.  This comprehensive                  
              use of computational chemistry is a major new level of                         
              undergraduate molecular modeling. Students will use the                        
              facility in laboratory, lecture and research aspects of their                  
              instructional sequence.
