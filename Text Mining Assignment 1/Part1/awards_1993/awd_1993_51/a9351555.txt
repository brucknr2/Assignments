Abstract    :
              Many existing senior integrated systems labs typically focus on                
              control of single-input/single-output processes that are no                    
              longer representative of modern multivariable processes in                     
              manufacturing, robotics, and aerospace applications. By                        
              performing practical control/robotic experiments which utilize                 
              floating point processors, the student engineer can obtain the                 
              training for coping with multi-input/multi-output systems such                 
              as a two-link robot manipulator or an inverted pendulum. To                    
              simplify the use of floating point processors, the Robotics and                
              Machine Automation Laboratory (RAMAL) Development group at the                 
              Clemson University Center for Advanced Manufacturing (CAM) has                 
              developed a WINDOWS MATLAB software interface which allows the                 
              user to program control algorithms for a high speed, floating                  
              point processor (i.e. the TYS320C30) in a straightforward                      
              manner.In this project, an Undergraduate Integrated Systems                    
              Laboratory (USIL) is developed in which seniors  perform a                     
              sequence of laboratory experiments involving mechanical design,                
              power amplification design, control design, and computer                       
              interface design. After the initial set of experiments, the                    
              students are required to integrate these various subsystem                     
              designs for experiments such as the inverted pendulum and a                    
              two-link robot manipulator. This project promulgates the                       
              transfer of the WINDOWS MATLAB software into the undergraduate                 
              curriculum through the use of six C30 workstations and the                     
              necessary supporting hardware.
