Abstract    :
              This project is increasing student participation in independent                
              research in human cognition, and in introductory and cognitive                 
              psychology courses. Moreover, it is expected to broaden                        
              students' direct experience with cognitive phenomena central to                
              contemporary research. A microcomputer facility with student                   
              stations networked to a fileserver and printers, plus                          
              experimentation software written for undergraduates, is being                  
              used in designing and conducting automated experiments in human                
              cognition. These facilities are also helping enrich and broaden                
              the research opportunities of psychology majors who must                       
              complete specific psychology courses and independent projects                  
              to satisfy requirements research courses.
