Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed project is to enrich the research                     
              experiences of beginning, intermediate, and advanced psychology                
              undergraduates by providing access to a networked microcomputer                
              laboratory. A networked laboratory, rather than a set of                       
              individual PCs, centralizes and expands laboratory resources                   
              with a curriculum-wide exposure in psychology. This encourages                 
              students to communicate with each other and the instructor on-                 
              line as they are working, provides a detailed record of student                
              use, and runs software that would be impossible on existing                    
              stand-alone equipment. Undergraduates also design and conduct                  
              three independent study projects each year and a senior thesis                 
              project their fourth. It is expected that this project will                    
              provide a setting where students can concentrate on hypothesis                 
              testing and conceptual analysis through data collection and                    
              analyses.
