Abstract    :
              9351620  Nelson                                                    This project
              will address a new approach to instruction in the  large-enrollment service
              undergraduate Organic Chemistry  Laboratory, characterized by new synthetic
              methodology based on the  use of supported reagents and catalysts that could be
              used in the  undergraduate organic laboratory, and more extensive use of GC and
               (FT)IR instrumentation commonly found in undergraduate organic  labs. In the
              case of supported materials, syntheses would be  carried out on or catalyzed by
              material adsorbed or bound ionically  or covalently to various supports. The
              supports would be similar to  silica-based or styrene-divinylbenzene HPLC
              bonded phases, and be  used in set-ups commonly referred to as solid phase
              extraction  (SPE) devices. There is a wide variety of these materials 
              commercially available at this time. Equivalent materials can be  prepared by
              the user if desired at a considerable cost saving.  A  second group of
              experiments would be designed as catalytic vapor  phase reactions that could be
              carried out in a modified injection  port of a gas chromatograph. An
              alternative set-up would involve a  small reactor column placed either in the
              column oven of the G.C.  or in an auxiliary oven and used in conjunction with
              multiport  valves. The gas chromatograph would then be used to analyze, and 
              possibly isolate, the reaction products. Experiments would  emphasize
              principles rather than product isolation and  characterization.
