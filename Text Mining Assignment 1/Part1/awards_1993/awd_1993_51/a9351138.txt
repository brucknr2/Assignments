Abstract    :
              9351138  Colvin                                                              A
              computer and demonstration classroom is being developed for use  in courses
              designed primarily for mathematics and mathematics  education majors. By
              developing an appreciation and excitement for  using computers in abstract
              algebra, linear algebra, combinatorics,  and number theory courses these
              students will be given the skills  necessary to bring mathematics alive for
              them.  The classroom will  be constructed to allow students, working in pairs,
              to use  computers and specialized software to enhance the instruction. 
              Prospective teachers completing this sequence of courses will be  able to use
              computers in classrooms and therefore be able to  influence the movement
              towards the introduction of technology into  their classrooms. They will be
              able to observe the benefits  obtained from a computer based teaching
              environment. As teachers  they will be able to convey these benefits to their
              students and  thereby contribute to making mathematics come alive for the next 
              generation.  ***
