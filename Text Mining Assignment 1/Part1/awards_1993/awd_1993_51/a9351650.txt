Abstract    :
              9351650  Cocchetto  Instrumentation for Data Acquisition and Control  This
              project provides support facilities for an inter-  disciplinary instrumentation
              course that serves multiple  Associate and Bachelor of Technology programs. It
              also improves  the instruction of transducer principles and their extension to 
              system applications. By providing students with an  instrumentation workstation
              that functions with numerous built-  in transducers in conjunction with
              data-acquisition hardware  and advanced engineering software, basic
              instrumentation  principles are demonstrated. Specifically, this project allows
               students:     *  to acquire data from transducers in an automated fashion;    
              *  to use their acquired data for further mathematical                
              analysis;     *  to use their acquired data as a stimulus for theoretical      
                   system model evaluations; and     *  to use their acquired data to support
              real-time process             control experiments.  Providing computer-based
              simulation tools for the evaluation of  systems that are too complex to
              construct in the laboratory, or  too expensive and time-intensive to implement
              in practice,   allows students to expand their knowledge of basic course 
              principles to those examples that encompass complex systems  encountered in the
              workplace.  ***y
