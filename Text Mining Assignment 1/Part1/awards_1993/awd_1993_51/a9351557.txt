Abstract    :
              Fifteen Macintosh Quadra workstations and one Dec file server                  
              will provide, in a newly constructed mathematics and computer                  
              center, a laboratory/classroom for integrating computing and                   
              Mathematica into the calculus curriculum. The Calculus                         
              Laboratory will allow each section of calculus to use an                       
              extensive amount of laboratory material that has been developed                
              recently at Carleton and elsewhere. The goal of this project is                
              to engage all calculus students in hands-on, investigative, and                
              experiential learning; to enhance a concepts-oriented approach                 
              to calculus; and to provide the students with a powerful                       
              symbolic, graphical, and numerical tool for understanding and                  
              applying calculus.
