Abstract    :
              9351096  Holliday  The Department of Physics and Instrumentation at Athens State
               College is engaged in a major project to offer its students a  quality,
              state-of-the-art laboratory experience to accompany  classroom lectures. 
              Computers, data acquisition software, and  interfacing hardware are being used
              in an interfacing and  instrumentation laboratory that offers students in our 
              Instrumentation Technology and Physics programs a quality  laboratory in which
              to work and exercise their creativity.  Instrumentation students have
              opportunities to take scenarios  of their own design and implement them on a
              modern system.  These students also have the opportunity to take part in an 
              individual or group design and implementation project. Many of  these projects
              require students to design a system to measure  some physical quantity
              associated with some physical situation,  such as light intensity, temperature,
              or sound frequency. Many  of the projects lend themselves easily to
              applications in the  laboratories associated with our upper level physics
              classes.  The equipment that has been acquired therefore serves to  acquaint
              students in two disciplines with state-of-the-art  techniques and apparatus,
              and each discipline does so within  the correct context of that discipline;
              instrumentation  students in the design and implementation of data acquisition 
              systems, and physics students in the use of modern apparatus to  perform
              experiments and analyze data.   ***
