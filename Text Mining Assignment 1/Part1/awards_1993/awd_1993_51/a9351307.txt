Abstract    :
              This project is further developing an ongoing effort at Harvey                 
              Mudd College to provide students with interactive computer                     
              experience in the mathematics classroom. The introductory                      
              Ordinary Differential Equations course in which students are                   
              exposed to such instruction at Harvey Mudd College is required                 
              of all students regardless of major. During the past two years                 
              they have developed an interactive computer workbook,                          
              Differential Equations Laboratory Workbook, co-authored by                     
              Robert Borrelli and Courtney Coleman of Harvey Mudd and William                
              Boyce of RPI.  Students have weekly laboratory assignments from                
              this workbook. This book has been published by Wiley.  In this                 
              project they are expanding the successful approach described                   
              above to create a computer laboratory environment and                          
              laboratory manuals and exercises for two additional                            
              computationally intensive mathematics courses, Numerical                       
              Analysis and Scientific Computing.  Materials will be widely                   
              disseminated.
