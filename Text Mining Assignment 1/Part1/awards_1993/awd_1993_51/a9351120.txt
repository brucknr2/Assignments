Abstract    :
                 The Department of Engineering at Winona State University                    
              offers a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Composite Materials                 
              Engineering. Composites are lightweight materials which exhibit                
              both high strength and stiffness and are fabricated by                         
              embedding reinforcing fibers into a polymeric, ceramic, or                     
              metal matrix. The aim of this project is to establish polymer                  
              synthesis and molecular weight characterization capabilities                   
              which are currently absent in this program. To achieve this                    
              objective, we are requesting the purchase of a glass reactor,                  
              a high pressure metal reactor, two viscometers, and a high                     
              temperature gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) unit. These                     
              instruments will be used in "hands on" polymer and engineering                 
              laboratory instruction, and for independent faculty-student                    
              research on synthesis and characterization of advanced                         
              polymeric materials for use as matrices in composite                           
              structures. The acquisition of this equipment plays a critical                 
              role in the integration of synthesis laboratory experience into                
              the chemistry and composite materials engineering curricula.
