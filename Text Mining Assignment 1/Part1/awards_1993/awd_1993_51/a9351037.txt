Abstract    :
              9351037  Rainwater   This project provides equipment that is being used to
              support  a new undergraduate course, Marine Biology, designed for  biology
              majors. Specific equipment is used for field and  laboratory exercises focusing
              on Texas coastal barrier island  environments and the organisms that inhabit
              them. Field  exercises include profiles of coastal waters and lagoons, 
              analysis of bottom sediments and organisms, and studies of  benthic
              communities. Laboratory studies also physiological  adaptations and behavioral
              interactions of cold- water  organisms, and marine plants and invertebrate
              animals collected  in the field. It is expected that an increased appreciation
              of  the marine environment will result from these studies.  Moreover, the
              project will provide meaningful field and  laboratory experiences in marine
              biology for undergraduate  students.  ***
