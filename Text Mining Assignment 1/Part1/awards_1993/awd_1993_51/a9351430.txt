Abstract    :
              This newly designed course in molecular biology features the                   
              use of chemiluminescent and chromogenic techniques, thus                       
              eliminating the need for radioisotopes in probing and                          
              sequencing.Also featured is the use of plants for projects                     
              involving eukaryotes, avoiding the problems associated with                    
              animals but allowing exploration of recombinant DNA and                        
              molecular evolution in complex, differentiated organisms.  The                 
              courses include a basic molecular biology course, an advanced                  
              course in recombinant DNA and molecular evolution, and                         
              undergraduate research projects in molecular and population                    
              genetics. Some of these projects act as pilot runs for                         
              developing labs for the advanced molecular biology course. Some                
              of the exercises included are DNA amplification via polymerase                 
              chain reaction (PCR), transformation of plant tissue with                      
              Agrobacterium, isolation of plant organelles and their DNA and                 
              enzymes, DNA sequencing, and developmental expression of genes.
