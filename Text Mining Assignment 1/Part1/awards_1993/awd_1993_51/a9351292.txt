Abstract    :
              We are creating a new and innovative undergraduate laboratory                  
              in high-energy physics, based on a study of catastrophic energy                
              loss by muons which was done at Fermilab and published this                    
              year in Physical Review D.  In the Fermilab experiment, the                    
              energy deposition spectrum of cosmic rays was studied using an                 
              iron/scintillator calorimeter.  The undergraduate laboratory                   
              version is being constructed of lead and scintillator.                         
              Although typical cosmic-ray muons deposit very little energy,                  
              one in 10,000 muons undergo a catastrophic energy loss and                     
              create a high-energy electromagnetic shower within the                         
              detector.  Students not only study the electromagnetic showers                 
              themselves but also use the highest energy showers to estimate                 
              the cosmic ray spectrum.  The apparatus is small enough to fit                 
              on a lab bench, yet exposes the student to state-of-the-art                    
              techniques for calorimetry and data acquisition which are used                 
              in present-day particle-physics experiments.
