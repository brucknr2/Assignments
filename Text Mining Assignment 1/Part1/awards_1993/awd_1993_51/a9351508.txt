Abstract    :
              This project is expected to increase the range and scope of                    
              ecological research by advanced students. Specifically,                        
              computing, laboratory and field equipment is used in student-                  
              designed research projects. Student-directed research is being                 
              emphasized in several upper level field-oriented courses, in                   
              ecologically focused independent studies,  and in                              
              student/faculty collaborative research. The project is also                    
              important in  maintaining an active, viable research program in                
              ecology at the institution.
