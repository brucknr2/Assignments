Abstract    :
              The project will modify the general chemistry course toward a                  
              foundation based upon atomic and molecular structure on which                  
              to develop chemical concepts taught in this course and courses                 
              that follow.  Students will learn to predict chemical behavior                 
              based on an inspection of structure with a view to identifying                 
              electrophilic and nucleophilic sites, and with an emphasis on                  
              critical thinking, rather than memorization. A variable-                       
              temperature, high field, proton-carbon NMR will provide a part                 
              of the instrumental basis for this approach.  Using this                       
              instrument, students will appreciate how the structure of                      
              matter determines its reactivity and how structure can change                  
              with time and/or temperature (kinetics and equilibrium).  The                  
              instrument will be used in general chemistry, organic                          
              chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry,                            
              instrumental methods, and student research.
