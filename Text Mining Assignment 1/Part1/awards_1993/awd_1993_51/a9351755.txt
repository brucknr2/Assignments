Abstract    :
              9351755  Stewart  Microscopes For Curricular And Research Growth  The Department
              of Geology is purchasing five petrographic  microscopes that are being used in
              three courses (Optical  Crystallography, Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology, and
               Sedimentary Petrology -- all required for the Bachelor of  Science degree) and
              in undergraduate research projects.  The  geology program has grown over 300%
              in the last four years, and  microscopy continues to be a crucial aspect of
              this growing  undergraduate program.  ***y
