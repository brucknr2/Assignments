Abstract    :
              9351532  Mullen  This project is completing the modernization of a computerized 
              weather laboratory.  We are patterning our laboratory after the  successful
              "Networked Desktop Synoptic Laboratory" that was  developed by the Department
              of Atmospheric Science at the  University of Illinois, but our laboratory is
              being tailored to  fit the specific needs of our undergraduate program.  We are
               initially relying upon analysis and display software supported  and
              distributed by the NSF-sponsored UNIDATA Program which will  minimize the
              project's "spin-up" time.  Once the proposed  laboratory facilities are in
              place, new analysis software and  laboratory exercises will be developed by the
              PI that, once  thoroughly tested, will be donated to the UNIDATA Program 
              Center Office for distribution to other interested atmospheric  science
              departments.  The modernized laboratory fulfills the department's projected 
              hardware needs in the area of undergraduate laboratory  instruction in synoptic
              meteorology (both for upper-division  majors and survey-level non-science
              majors) for the next 5  years. It allows us to take full advantage of the
              ongoing  modernization of the National Weather Service (NWS) which  includes
              the eventual co-location of our department with the  NWS Tucson Forecast
              Office.  ***
