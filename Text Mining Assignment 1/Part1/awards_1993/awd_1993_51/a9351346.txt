Abstract    :
                  The project will enhance students' conceptual understanding                
              of organic chemistry,develop students' scientific problem                      
              solving skills, and increase students' enjoyment of science                    
              using an adaptation of the discovery approach of the new                       
              University of Michigan organic chemistry sequence to a format                  
              suitable for a suburban community college. The key modification                
              is the provision for a more supportive environment to encourage                
              and motivate a very diverse student population. Computer based                 
              tools will be used to provide conceptual organization and                      
              structure to laboratory work and to establish stronger links                   
              between the lecture and laboratory.  The computer based                        
              organizational shell will combine visualizations of molecular                  
              models and mechanistic animations with spectroscopic data and                  
              laboratory observations to help students build mental models of                
              chemical phenomena based upon how chemists think at the                        
              molecular level. In classroom and laboratory lectures, faculty                 
              routinely will use computer displays to illustrate basic                       
              concepts of organic chemistry and to show the inter-                           
              relationships between theory and experiments. Students will use                
              the software in the laboratory to better understand the                        
              underlying concepts, experimental design, and analysis of                      
              instrumental data.
