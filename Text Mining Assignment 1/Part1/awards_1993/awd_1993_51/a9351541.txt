Abstract    :
              9351541  Weiss       This project involves fundamental changes in the ways 
              statistics is taught in required and advanced undergraduate  statistics courses
              in psychology. Students, many of whom have  poor academic preparation and/or
              language difficulties, benefit  from a highly visual and interactive learning
              environment by  using an electronic classroom facility that contains student 
              workstations with computers linked an instructor's station, as  well as to the
              department and university computer networks.  Mathematical and statistical
              illustrations are presented in a  manner which enhances concepts. Students also
              perform  appropriate exercises while the instructor monitors their  progress
              and interacts with them. It is expected that the  facility will also benefit
              instruction in experimental  psychology, testing, and courses in computer
              applications in  psychology.   ***
