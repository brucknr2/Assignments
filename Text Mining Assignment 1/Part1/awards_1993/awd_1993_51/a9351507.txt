Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to improve the quality of undergraduate                     
              teaching in Mechanical Engineering by enhancing the contents                   
              and available laboratory equipment of the senior level course                  
              of Mechanical Engineering Laboratory II.                                       
              The approach used in teaching this course is by "hands-on"                     
              procedures.  This proposal seeks funding towards the                           
              improvement of current weaknesses by: (1) Modernizing the                      
              current instrumentation of a rotatory compressor by interfacing                
              it to a computer data acquisition system such that students get                
              involved, at least once, in the use of such kind of systems                    
              thus retrieving on line information that can be used to monitor                
              the performance of the entire unit and perform mass and energy                 
              balances; (2) Acquiring a laboratory unit for the study of                     
              noise control, and (3) Acquiring a laboratory unit for the                     
              study of combustion parameters and emissions control. It is                    
              expected that this course will also assist on providing                        
              supplementing material other than classroom for the courses of                 
              Thermal Sciences.
