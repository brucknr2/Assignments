Abstract    :
              Concordia College plans to transform the teaching of science to                
              general students, pre-service teachers and science majors by                   
              developing integrated course curricula involving computers and                 
              video technology. This revitalization of the curriculum will                   
              enhance scientific literacy among the general student body,                    
              bring science majors in step with the rapidly advancing                        
              technologies, and prepare teachers willing to use scientific                   
              methodologies in their elementary and secondary classrooms.                    
              Computerization of the empirical process makes knowledge much                  
              easier to attain and eliminates much of the tedium associated                  
              with routine activities in science. The addition of video-                     
              interactive capabilities to the development of courses for                     
              potential majors and for pre-service teachers will also                        
              increase the attractiveness of the scientific process,                         
              hopefully resulting in more individuals becoming scientifically                
              literate. The interaction generated between science majors and                 
              non-major students as a result of the development and                          
              implementation of computer-based data gathering and analysis                   
              should also enhance the understanding of non-scientists of the                 
              scientific enterprise and sensitize scientists to the                          
              preconceptions and limitations of the general public.
