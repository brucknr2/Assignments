Abstract    :
              The department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Calvin                   
              College is creating a Macintosh laboratory in which students                   
              can use Mathematica and other mathematical software to do                      
              mathematics. All sections of first-year calculus are being                     
              taught in a lecture/lab format, meeting three hours per week                   
              for lecture and for one two-hour period each week in the                       
              laboratory. The laboratory component of the course is improving                
              the student experience in calculus. Students are gaining a                     
              deeper, more conceptual understanding of mathematical ideas                    
              because they are freed from some of their computational                        
              limitations and can visualize more easily using the powerful                   
              graphical capability of Mathematica and the Macintosh. Students                
              are working in pairs; thus facilitating cooperative learning.                  
              The laboratory is equipped with 19 Macintosh IIvx computers.The                
              laboratory are also being used in most upper-level mathematics                 
              courses, but in a somewhat different way. Students in those                    
              courses are already familiar with the software, so they are                    
              working more independently. They are given regular assignments                 
              that require them to go to the lab on their own to complete the                
              assignment using Mathematica.
