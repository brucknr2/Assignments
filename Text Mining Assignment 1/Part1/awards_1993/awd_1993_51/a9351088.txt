Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to provide experimental                       
              apparatus (a wind tunnel and a water tunnel) for undergraduate                 
              engineering students in the Fluids/Thermal Laboratory (junior                  
              level; 1 credit hour, required course for a B.S. in Mechanical                 
              Engineering) and the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (senior                 
              level; 3 credit hours; required course for a B.S. in Mechanical                
              Engineering) that would permit them to investigate important                   
              problems in fluid mechanics and heat transfer, which they                      
              cannot currently investigate. The wind and water tunnels (with                 
              basic instrumentation system, and model and calibration sets)                  
              would be used for "new" investigations concerning the                          
              foundations of viscous and pressure drags, aerodynamics, and                   
              convective heat transfer. The addition of these "new"                          
              investigations to the Fluids/Thermal Laboratory would                          
              substantially improve laboratory experiences of undergraduate                  
              Mechanical Engineering students (particularly since the                        
              majority work full- or part-time during the day).  Furthermore,                
              the acquisition of a wind tunnel and a water tunnel (with the                  
              associated instrumentation systems) would permit, and                          
              encourage, undergraduate engineering students to pursue "self                  
              initiated" investigations, "independent study" courses, and                    
              "undergraduate research" in general areas of fluid mechanics,                  
              convective heat transfer, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and                     
              biofluiddynamics. Importantly, in most of the envisioned "self                 
              initiated" investigations, the students would only need to                     
              construct "models and/or systems" to be tested in the wind                     
              tunnel and/or in the water tunnel; this would be a major                       
              improvement when compared to the current situation, where the                  
              students are also required to construct the associated                         
              experimental\test apparatus.
