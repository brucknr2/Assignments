Abstract    :
              Management of Alaska's wildlife populations is of fundamental                  
              importance to the biotic as well as the economic integrity of                  
              the nation and the state. This project gives undergraduates in                 
              wildlife biology exposure to the tools used in contemporary                    
              management of wildlife populations. This exposure is                           
              distributed among three courses taken during the sophomore,                    
              junior, and senior years. Students explore the dynamics of                     
              wildlife populations in the sophomore-level course; gain                       
              experience in gathering field data in the junior-level course;                 
              and synthesize data and project future population levels as                    
              seniors. Students also learn analytical techniques, with                       
              collaborative exercises, mimicking management teams used by                    
              resource management agencies. Students are expected to present                 
              results of their investigations to peers, both orally and in                   
              writing, to enhance communication skills.
