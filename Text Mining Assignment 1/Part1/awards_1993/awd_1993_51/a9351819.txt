Abstract    :
              Calvin College's Physics Department intends to strengthen its                  
              capabilities in teaching, to intermediate- and upper-level                     
              undergraduates, the fundamental experimental techniques used in                
              solid-state physics and the neighboring areas of materials                     
              science.  To do so, we have selected the major areas of                        
              thermal, magnetic, and electrical measurements, and have                       
              devised an instrumentation initiative which enables these                      
              material properties to be measured over a wide range of                        
              temperature.  The initiative also introduces students to some                  
              of the basic techniques of materials production widely used in                 
              condensed-matter physics.                                                      
              Our initiative acquired a differential scanning calorimeter                    
              system, for study of specific heat capacity and phase                          
              transitions; a magnetic susceptibility system applicable over                  
              the 8-325 K range; and a very versatile electronic instrument                  
              package for electrical transport and polarizability                            
              measurement.  A closed-cycle cryocooler is being acquired to                   
              provide the temperature control for the magnetic and electrical                
              measurements. Finally, for purposes of sample preparation, we                  
              have acquired a simple furnace, and basic vacuum evaporation                   
              and sputtering systems, for bulk and thin-film sample and                      
              materials preparation.
