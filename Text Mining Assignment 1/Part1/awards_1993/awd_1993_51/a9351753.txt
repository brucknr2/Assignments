Abstract    :
              9351753  Buckeye  Computer Laboratory for Elementary and Secondary Teacher 
              Preparation   A computer laboratory is supporting three mathematics  Elementary
              and Secondary Teacher Certification and Endorsement  programs. The geometry
              area in these programs, in particular,  is benefiting from an extensive
              microcomputer laboratory  experience in order to prepare prospective teachers
              for an  effective classroom environment in the elementary and secondary 
              schools.  A major goal of the facility is to enable students to use  computer
              software to explore the ways microcomputers can  provide technological
              assistance for the mathematics teachers  K-12.  ***z
