Abstract    :
              9351679 May This project will improve the chemistry curriculum by incorporating
              state of the art computer controlled analytical instruments into laboratory in
              struction directed to the first year chemistry student.  The three instru ments
              chosen that meet these criteria include; a computer controlled diode array,
              spectrophotometer, gas chromatographs, a liquid chromatograph, and personal com
              puters for the laboratory use with the chromatographs. The laboratory
              experiments in first year chemistry will be redesigned with 30% of the present
              exercises elim inated as being outdated, 40% of the present experiments will be
              augmented with the purchased instrumentation, and the remaining experiments
              will be new and based on applications of the instruments that illustrate the
              lecture material with procedures found in modern chemistry laboratories. The
              students will benefit from this project in several ways including; (a) the
              laboratory work will gen erate more enthusiasm for and interest in chemistry;
              (b) they will start their training early in laboratory techniques required of a
              competent chemist or graduate student; (c) the laboratory work will more
              effectively illustrate the lecture material; and (d) they will have the
              opportunity to become involved in the design of their own experiments. ***
