Abstract    :
              9351543  Quon  A modern optics laboratory course has been developed with 
              state-of-the-art optical technologies including lasers,  photodetectors with
              computer interfacing, fiber optics,  optomechanical fixtures, and ray tracing
              optic computer  software.  The course has weekly laboratory classes which make 
              use of small group mentoring activities.  ***
