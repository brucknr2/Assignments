Abstract    :
              9351060  Lisantti                             This project is incorporating
              nuclear physics experiments into  laboratories for both science and non-science
              majors. The  randomness of radioactive decay is being used to visualize 
              statistical quantities and distributions.  Experiments in Nuclear  Physics,
              such as determining the range of the three types of  radiation in various
              materials, are being used to familiarize  students with radiation and with
              shielding used in radiation  facilities.  A NaI detector, along with a
              computer-controlled  multichannel analyzer, are being used to introduce
              students to the  interfacing of equipment to computers.  A low level counting
              system  utilizing a HpGe detector and associated electronics, computer, and 
              software is being set up which will allow for environmental testing  of
              materials from different local sites. This detector system is  also being used
              in conjunction with our neutron source to perform  some neutron activation
              analysis related experiments.
