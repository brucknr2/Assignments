Abstract    :
              9351814  Miles  A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) is being 
              integrated into the laboratory program in order to  significantly enhance the
              quality of the courses in general,  organic, and analytical chemistry.  The
              GC/MS is allowing the  teaching in a hands-on fashion of the principles of
              separation  and identification in the analysis of complex materials.  It  also
              is forming the cornerstone in a new laboratory course in  environmental
              chemistry which is being developed.  This new  course is being offered in
              conjunction with our existing  lecture course as an elective, and as part of
              the environmental  science minor program.  It is being taken by a wide range of
               science and non-science majors interested in the environment.   In this course
              the instrument is being used extensively for  analysis of real environmental
              samples collected at a wide  variety of locations around Pennsylvania. 
              Finally, the  instrument is finding extensive use by student researchers in 
              the chemistry department as well as in the engineering,  biology, physics, and
              geology departments.   ***
