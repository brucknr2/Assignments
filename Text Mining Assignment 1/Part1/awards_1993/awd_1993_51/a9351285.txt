Abstract    :
              This new introductory biology laboratory course includes                       
              extensive hands-on experience and introduces freshmen students                 
              to research.  Students use some of the same equipment used in                  
              upper division laboratory courses.  Phenomena studied include                  
              cellular and subcellular structure, gene transformation,                       
              transduction and protein action, light absorption by                           
              chlorophyll, and animal behavior.
