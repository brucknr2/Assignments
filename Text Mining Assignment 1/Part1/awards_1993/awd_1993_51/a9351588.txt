Abstract    :
              Hammond  9351588  The  project will purchase a high field Fourier transform
              nuclear  magnetic resonance spectrometer (FT NMR) to improve  lower and  upper
              division chemistry and biochemistry laboratory courses. It  will also be used
              in advanced electives such as Polymer Synthesis  and Organic Preparations. The
              FT NMR spectrometer will introduce to  undergraduates the first and most
              sophisticated example of current  technology computer-driven chemical
              instrumentation at an early  stage in their academic careers. Students will
              receive a practical  introduction to structure determination by NMR
              spectroscopy during  the sophomore organic chemistry laboratory course, then
              continue  with applications in inorganic and P-chem.  It will also allow 
              students to determine structures of complex molecules using multi-  pulse
              sequence and 2D-NMR techniques.  ***
