Abstract    :
              9351951  Sohl                                 A modern laser physics laboratory
              is currently being developed  for use by undergraduate physics majors.  The
              laser lab will be  used to modernize three aspects of the curriculum at Weber 
              State University: 1) Upper-division Modern Physics Lab  experiments; 2) Applied
              Optics Lab experiments; and 3)  individual research projects. Typically, 15
              students per year  are involved with these courses. The Laser Lab also permits
              the  future addition to the curriculum of an advanced undergraduate  modern
              optics course.  The Laser Lab allows students in the Modern Physics Lab to 
              undertake experiments involving laser induced fluorescence, and  atomic
              structure, lifetimes and collisional processes.  These  experiments demonstrate
              many of the fundamental aspects of  quantum mechanics.  The Applied Optics
              course at Weber State University has a  strong laboratory component.  The Laser
              Lab gives the students  "hands-on" experience in the assembly, alignment,
              operation,  and use of various laser systems.  Laser spectroscopy is well
              suited for undergraduate research as  both the basic theory and the
              experimental apparatus are within  the grasp of juniors and seniors. The Laser
              Lab is expanding  the undergraduate research options to include atomic, 
              molecular, and optical physics. Thus, students are being better  prepared for
              future industrial or graduate school work in this  critical field.  The
              laboratory has been designed with individual workstations  which which
              simultaneous operation of several experiments. By  inserting a mirror or two,
              the laser beam(s) can be directed to  each station as needed.  ***
