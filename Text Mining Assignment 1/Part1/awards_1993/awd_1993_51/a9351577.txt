Abstract    :
              Many women are attracted to psychology as a college major;                     
              however, the majority of women nationally choose careers and                   
              graduate work in applied and clinical settings, rather than in                 
              research. At our institution, psychology attracts the third                    
              largest group of majors, with approximately one in four of                     
              these women (28%) obtaining teacher certification as                           
              preparation for a career in education. This project, therefore,                
              has created an integrated classroom laboratory for experimental                
              psychology. Students use computers regularly to study research                 
              methods and experimental psychology in an integrated fashion.                  
              Also, these hands-on applications allow students to gain                       
              experience and heighten confidence in their ability to conduct                 
              research as professional scientists, in applied field settings,                
              or as classroom teachers.
