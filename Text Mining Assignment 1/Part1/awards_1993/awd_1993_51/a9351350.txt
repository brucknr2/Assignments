Abstract    :
              Development of a Project Based Laboratory Sequence in Molecular                
              Biology and Biochemistry                                                       
              A project based laboratory curriculum in Molecular Biology and                 
              Biochemistry is being implemented.  The new curriculum offers                  
              students a coherent, project oriented laboratory experience                    
              that allows them to participate in the selection and design of                 
              experiments. The laboratory curriculum is engaging students in                 
              the scientific process and thereby is facilitating the                         
              development of the reflective judgment and problem solving                     
              skills relied upon by scientists.  The students are being                      
              acquainted with the techniques of molecular biology and                        
              biochemistry most commonly used to address research questions.                 
              In the Molecular Biology course, both molecular cloning and                    
              polymerase chain reaction techniques are being introduced, and                 
              students then are applying these techniques, using the DNA                     
              thermocycler, and exploring a question of interest.  In the                    
              Biochemistry course, protein purification is being approached                  
              by using recombinant DNA technology rather than by relying upon                
              classical tools. The Biochemistry course also is using high                    
              performance liquid chromatography to effect difficult                          
              separations of biomolecules.
