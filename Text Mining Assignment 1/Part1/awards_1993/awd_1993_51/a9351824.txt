Abstract    :
              9351824  George                               Assessing the risk incurred by a
              worker as a result of occupational  exposure to chemical or physical agents is
              an extremely complex  process involving the interaction of a variety of
              scientific  disciplines. One vital aspect of risk assessment is the accurate 
              quantification of worker exposure to the agent(s) involved.  The specific aim
              of this proposal is to provide the Industrial  Hygiene curriculum with the
              instrumentation necessary to teach  students the basic skills involved in
              adequate quantification of  chemical/physical stressors in the occupational
              environment. The  equipment requested enables students to gain expertise in 
              quantification techniques covering a broad range of commonly  encountered
              occupational hazards.  Students will gain knowledge in  the scientific
              principles of instrument operation, procedures of  instrument calibration and
              manipulation, and the actual use of the  equipment in field situations.
