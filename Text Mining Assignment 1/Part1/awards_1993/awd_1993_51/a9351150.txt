Abstract    :
              9351150  Spector  The project will purchase an FT-infrared spectrophotometer for
               use in the introductory freshman and organic courses.  The  innovative
              curricular approach will include aspects of  molecular symmetry, polymer
              properties, and studies of  inorganic complexes.  FTIR experiments will be
              introduced into  the first-year chemistry curriculum: functional group analysis
               of prepared polymer films and a comparative FTIR study of  organometallic
              complexes of D3, C2 and D2h symmetry.  In the  organic chemistry laboratory,
              concepts learned in general  chemistry will be reinforced by employing
              increasingly complex  and sophisticated experiments using FTIR spectroscopy.
              This  systematic approach to FTIR spectroscopy in the context of  organic
              chemistry will include: functional group analysis via  qualitative "unknown"
              analysis (reinforcing the thin-film  polymer general chemistry experiment);
              determination of purity  and completeness of a reaction; examination of
              chemical  equilibria (reinforcing thermodynamic concepts learned in  general
              chemistry); and examination of the molecular  environment (reinforcing the
              coordination complex general  chemistry IR experiment).  ***
