Abstract    :
              9351228  Longshore  An X-ray fluorescence spectrometer is being used as a state
              of  the art analytical instrument in the undergraduate geology  curriculum. 
              Operating principles are being introduced in  sophomore-level classes, and
              students are having hands on  experience with the equipment in several
              upper-division  laboratories, including petrography, igneous petrology, X-ray 
              powder methods, geochemistry, and economic geology.  Students  are using the
              apparatus to perform high precision major and  trace element analyses on a
              variety of geological materials in  these classes, elucidating course subject
              matter and gaining  practical experience with modern instrumentation.  The 
              analytical power of the requested equipment is finding  significant
              applications in senior undergraduate research  projects.  The ability of the
              students to obtain accurate  chemical data is greatly enhancing their abilities
              to achieve  their research objectives, to solve important problems, and to 
              contribute meaningfully to the knowledge of northern California  geology.  Many
              of these undergraduate projects are leading to  publications and presentations
              at professional meetings.  ***
