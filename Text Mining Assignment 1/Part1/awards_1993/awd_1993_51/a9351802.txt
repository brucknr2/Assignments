Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to advance student training and                     
              experience in investigative molecular biology. Specifically,                   
              the requested equipment, consisting of a high speed centrifuge                 
              and rotors, thermocycler, electroporator, nucleotide sequencing                
              and agarose gel electrophoresis equipment and related                          
              accessories, will support a new research-intensive advanced                    
              investigative molecular biology course in which students will                  
              characterize algal mitochondrial and chloroplast genome                        
              architecture and gene structure. The proposed equipment will be                
              used to increase the sophistication of strategies used for                     
              nucleic acid analysis including the isolation of purified                      
              organellar DNA, DNA library construction, genome mapping, and                  
              nucleotide sequence analysis of selected genes. Fundamental                    
              principles of DNA structure and function and basic techniques                  
              are presented in existing intorductory courses. Investigative                  
              Molecular Biology will offer opportunities that (1) provide for                
              advanced study of DNA organization and function; (2) serve as                  
              an avenue for student participation in investigative research;                 
              and (3) for biology majors, function to train and focus those                  
              students who anticipate entering into molecular biology related                
              honors research projects.
