Abstract    :
              A Computational Chemistry Laboratory will be established for                   
              undergraduate chemistry students at Hope College. Students will                
              use this facility across the chemistry curriculum and in                       
              undergraduate research. The facility will introduce students to                
              the rapidly evolving and enormously important area of                          
              computational chemistry. Instruction in the organic, physical,                 
              and advanced chemistry courses will be substantially enhanced                  
              through molecular mechanics calculations, molecular orbital                    
              calculations, electron density maps, 3-D visualization of                      
              steric and/or orbital overlap, reaction pathway calculations,                  
              infrared and UV/VIS spectra calculations, and more. Wherever                   
              possible, calculations from the Computational Chemistry                        
              Laboratory will be used to address questions arising from                      
              measurements made in the experimental laboratories. Students                   
              participating in Hope College's active undergraduate research                  
              program in chemistry will use these powerful computational                     
              techniques to understand and interpret their research results.
