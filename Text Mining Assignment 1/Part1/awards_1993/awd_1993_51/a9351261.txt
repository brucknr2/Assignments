Abstract    :
              9351261  Ghiorso                                                                
                      This project is transferring software technology, developed  for
              research in the geological sciences, into the curriculum  for undergraduate
              geology majors.  Six "advanced" computer  workstations are being used in
              computationally oriented  undergraduate laboratory classes.  These workstations
              have  extensive disk and memory resources, are capable of running a  multi-user
              operating system (e.g. UNIX), and are being  configured with sophisticated
              graphical display components.  In  addition, an overhead projector panel is
              being used in  conjunction with the advanced workstations.  The panel is 
              facilitating the integration of workstation displays into  moderate size (50
              student) classes.  This project is resulting  in new course offerings and is
              changing significantly the  nature of laboratory instruction in the department
              of  Geological Sciences.      ***
