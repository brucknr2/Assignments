Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is using an FTIR to catalyze a major                  
              revision of laboratory and lecture courses in chemistry. This                  
              instrument is being used to introduce basic spectrometry to                    
              students in teacher education programs, to underclass liberal                  
              arts majors and to bachelor of science majors (including                       
              chemistry and pre-professional majors) who in the past received                
              no exposure to this type of analysis.  Students and faculty at                 
              the three private colleges and three community colleges allied                 
              with Kansas Newman also have access to the FTIR.  Its                          
              application is being further expanded via workshops and                        
              advanced laboratory experiences for secondary teachers and for                 
              high school students enrolled in the Junior Academy of Science                 
              or in the Investigative Summer Science Program.  The FTIR is                   
              making possible major changes in upper level laboratory courses                
              by allowing fast, simple, and highly accurate analysis of all                  
              types of processes and compounds.
