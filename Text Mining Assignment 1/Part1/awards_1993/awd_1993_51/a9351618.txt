Abstract    :
              Josefson  9351618  The project will purchase Silicon Graphics Indigo
              Workstations,  along with the software packages, SYBLL and SPARTAN.  This 
              equipment will allow calculations on real molecules as the  basis for teaching
              principles in the inorganic, P-chem, and  biochemistry courses.  Among other
              applications, we will use ab  initio and semi-empirical calculations to
              investigate the  nature of the chemical bond. Real-time graphics will allow 
              students to visualize wave functions, electrostatic potential  maps, orbital
              symmetries, and molecular motions, making these  abstract principles more
              concrete. Basing these courses on  calculations and visualization of real
              molecules could begin a  major shift in the way students learn course
              principles,  providing an innovative alternative for other undergraduate 
              teachers.  ***
