Abstract    :
              A computerized learning environment Mathematica notebooks is                   
              enabling science students to actively learn calculus and                       
              differential equations with guided discovery and exploration.                  
              The Mathematics Department will fully implement this curriculum                
              in all sections of the science calculus sequence and in the                    
              two-semester differential equations sequence.  The curricular                  
              revisions are being coordinated with the science departments,                  
              who are also integrating active learning and technology in                     
              their courses. This collaboration, based on common pedagogical                 
              goals and software, brings more scientific applications into                   
              mathematics courses and strengthens the use of mathematics in                  
              science courses.  Project participants are conducting workshops                
              for other mathematics faculty, and for high school teachers and                
              students, including workshops especially for minority high                     
              school students.
