Abstract    :
              This project is expanding a pilot program developed by two of                  
              the co-principal investigators to enhance the mathematics                      
              curriculum at Palomar College with computer technology.                        
              Preliminary laboratory materials were developed for teaching                   
              one section of College Algebra and one section of Calculus I                   
              with a computer laboratory component during the spring 1992                    
              semester. This project is providing the resources to continue                  
              that curriculum development and expand to other College                        
              Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus I sections. Macintosh                       
              computers and associated peripherals are being used to provide                 
              a laboratory component for College Algebra, Precalculus, and                   
              Calculus I courses offered by the college. The computers are                   
              empowering students to simultaneously represent functions in                   
              numeric, symbolic and graphic form. Students can visualize                     
              mathematical concepts without the need for excessive                           
              preliminary concentration on rote manipulation. Students                       
              concentrate on learning concepts through guided discovery,                     
              using problem solving strategies, and becoming familiar with                   
              how mathematics is done outside the classroom. The laboratory                  
              environment is requiring students to work collaboratively and                  
              write about the mathematics they are learning.
