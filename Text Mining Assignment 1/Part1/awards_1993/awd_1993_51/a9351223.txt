Abstract    :
              Morgan State University will establish a local area computer                   
              network to serve as the basis for a laboratory for mathematics                 
              courses. With the help of a laboratory, conceptual                             
              understanding will be stressed and meaningful problem-solving                  
              skills will be developed. Laboratory assignments will become an                
              intrinsic part of the courses taught. In particular, the                       
              Calculus sequence through Introductory Differential Equations,                 
              as well as the mathematics course for prospective elementary                   
              teachers and a methods courses for prospective  secondary                      
              school teachers will be affected.                                              
              The goal of the project is to attract more minority students                   
              and women to the sciences, engineering and mathematics, and to                 
              provide a better preparation for prospective teachers by                       
              providing a different approach to the teaching of mathematics.                 
              The computer lab will enable faculty to engage students in                     
              actively doing mathematics instead of just lecturing to                        
              students.
