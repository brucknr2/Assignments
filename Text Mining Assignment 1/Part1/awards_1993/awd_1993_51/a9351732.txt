Abstract    :
              The project involves development of a Biochemistry course within               
              the Chemistry Department.  The course will introduce will                      
              ultimately be composed of five modules which will include: l)                  
              purification of -galactosidase from Ecoli; 2) cloning of the gene             
              for this protein; 3) preparation of site directed mutants to                   
              investigate the mechanism of this protein; 4) use of steady state              
              and presteady state kinetics as probes of the mechanism of this                
              enzyme. The fifth module will be developed by each student with the            
              assistance and input from the instructor.
