Abstract    :
              Students use an image analysis facility: an integrated system                  
              of microscopes, cameras, and a central processing computer, to                 
              capture and analyze a wide variety of biological images.                       
              Students research subject areas as diverse as molecular cell                   
              biology, biomechanics, microbial ecology, developmental                        
              biology, and population ecology.  The model of teaching through                
              research translates biological principles into real experiences                
              and improves the preparation of students for graduate studies                  
              and technological fields.
