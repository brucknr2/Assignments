Abstract    :
              Significant changes are being made in order to improve and                     
              modernize the general chemistry course.  The most important is                 
              the conversion to a laboratory-centered, inquiry-based                         
              approach, in which important concepts are being "discovered" by                
              the students in the laboratory before they are discussed in                    
              lecture.  As a result, students are becoming much more involved                
              in the course, and the relation between experimental results                   
              and theory is more apparent.  In addition, a new "computers in                 
              chemistry" component is being introduced to supplement the                     
              lectures and laboratories.  The course is being enhanced                       
              further by integrating the computers into the laboratory,                      
              utilizing computer-interfaced equipment.  The use of computers                 
              in the laboratory is introducing students to modern methods of                 
              data acquisition and analysis while improving the discovery                    
              process in a variety of ways, including the following:  1.                     
              Experimental data is being gathered more quickly and                           
              accurately, and then being pooled and stored for subsequent                    
              analysis.  2. Laboratory procedures are being monitored while                  
              in progress, and then modified or repeated as needed.  3.                      
              Graphing and interpretation of data is being greatly facili-                   
              tated, enabling the students to more readily see the patterns                  
              and relationships that are so critical to the discovery-based                  
              method.
