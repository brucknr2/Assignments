Abstract    :
              9351449  Anderson  The laboratory sequence of the introductory physics courses 
              required of all science majors, "Fundamentals of Physics I and  II", have been
              redesigned and upgraded through the addition of  computer-assisted laboratories
              (CAL) that focus on multiple  concept experiments (MCE), and that employ
              "state-of-the art"  data acquisition techniques.  Although the multi-concept 
              approach normally entails complicated set-ups and complex data  collection, the
              use of data acquisition instrumentation  simplifies the procedural aspects of
              such experiments.  The MCE  series being implemented are based on
              magnetoelastic phenomena;  simple harmonic motion and resonance; elastic
              properties, speed  of sound, and modulus; damping, Q and efficiency; magnetic 
              fields in induction; and ferromagnetism, permeability, and  magnetostriction.  
                 CAL software is being utilized that is portable between  different computer
              platforms and that can be easily programmed  to do sophisticated control and
              analysis of any type of  experiment.  The selected software - Lab View II -
              employs real  and virtual instruments.  The students simply use a window 
              interface to select the experiment.  After reviewing the  procedure and
              performing an optional tutorial and simulation,  the students set-up the
              experiment using both real and virtual  instruments.    Computer-assisted
              instructional modules (not part of this  grant) enable students to engage in
              self-paced study and review  of course content, including the laboratory
              experience.    ***
