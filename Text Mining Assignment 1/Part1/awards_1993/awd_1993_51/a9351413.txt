Abstract    :
              9351413  Jeries  This proposal addresses the need to strengthen the computer
              science  curriculum for major and non-majors by improving the laboratory.  The
              project will develop a workstation laboratory to support the  computer science
              curriculum, including networking and simulation.   Under a separate proposal
              the institution will request support for  connection to NSFNet.   The proposed
              improvements will greatly  enhance the laboratory experiences for the students
              broadening  their knowledge of the computer field, specifically in the 
              workstation and computer networking areas. This knowledge will  enable students
              from the HBCU to be more competitive in the  workplace and/or to facilitate
              their acceptance and success in  graduate school.  ***
