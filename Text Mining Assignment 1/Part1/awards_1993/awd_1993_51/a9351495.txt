Abstract    :
              9351495  Jasinski  A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) is serving
              as  a cornerstone of our new laboratory teaching effort.  The  instrument is
              being used in laboratories at all levels.   Beginning with demonstration in a
              project-oriented introductory  chemistry lab, the instrument is being used in
              increasingly  sophisticated ways in higher level courses.  Introduction of 
              FTIR into the introductory organic laboratory is enhancing the  ability of
              students to accurately analyze the small amounts of  compounds that result from
              microscale experiments.  In  addition, students are being introduced to a wider
              variety of  sampling techniques, including diffuse reflectance.  Judicious 
              choice of detectors (DTGS or MCT) allows for more sensitivity  to low light
              throughput at a faster scan rate than dispersive  IR spectrometers.  FTIR
              techniques are enhancing our  capabilities in the instrumental course as well
              as the  polymers, pharmaceutical and medicinal applications in the  industrial
              chemistry laboratory and in undergraduate research.   Students are being
              introduced to modern spectral manipulation  and database searching techniques
              as well as essential  parameters of FTIR spectroscopy including signal
              averaging,  repetitive scanning, resolution comparison and standards 
              collections.  ***
