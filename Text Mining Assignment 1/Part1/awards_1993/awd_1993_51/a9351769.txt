Abstract    :
              This project establishes a Microcomputer Interfacing Laboratory                
              used primarily for teaching pre-service science teachers how                   
              computers can be used for direct data acquisition from science                 
              experiments.  The overall goal is to develop in the students                   
              familiarity and skills relating to the use of the computer in                  
              modern experimental science. The new Laboratory is used in                     
              several courses, particularly in a science teaching methods                    
              course and a course associated with the Computer Applications                  
              Minor program.  Students develop computer-interfaced                           
              experimental projects that can be used in high school or                       
              college science courses in the content areas of earth science,                 
              biology, chemistry, and physics. The laboratory experiments                    
              will be compiled into a "Multidisciplinary Science Laboratory                  
              Interfacing Manual."  Also, in-service workshops will be held                  
              for local high school teachers to demonstrate computer                         
              interfacing equipment and student-developed lessons and to                     
              allow teacher to create their own lessons for incorporation in                 
              the Manual.
