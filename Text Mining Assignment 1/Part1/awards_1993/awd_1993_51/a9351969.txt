Abstract    :
              9351969  Filer       This project supports an economics undergraduate
              instructional  laboratory containing workstations linked to a file-server by  a
              local area network. In particular, the lab is being used to  implement a
              revised curriculum designed so that students are  graduates comfortable with
              modern computing tools, have  adequate hands-on experience in empirical data
              analysis, can  use econometric tools to write at least one original research 
              paper, and are familiar with the use of computers in model  building and
              simulation analysis. It is expected that the  project both provide our students
              with a better understanding  of modern economics and encourage significantly
              more of them to  continue on to graduate education.   ***
