Abstract    :
              9351503  Tucker  The project's main goals are to enhance Sage Junior College of 
              Albany students' understanding of the basic concepts of physics  and to
              encourage more students to consider careers in science.   This is being
              accomplished by introducing microcomputer-based  experiments into our physics
              laboratories and the physics  elective courses, Astronomy and Energy and the
              Environment.   Students are employing the computers to collect, analyze and 
              graph experimental data.  The immediate feedback students  receive encourages
              participation and innovation.  Support was  obtained for software and hardware
              for six, networked Macintosh  Si color computers each equipped with a Universal
              Lab Interface  and a variety of probes and sensors and a networked printer.   A
              modem is used to obtain software from remote locations.  A  CD-ROM drive
              improves the curriculum of the elective courses.   Software, including a
              spreadsheet, physics and astronomy  simulations, and utilities, has also been
              purchased.  This  project is stimulating the teaching of physics related
              courses  at the College.  It exposes students to modern apparatus and  data
              collection techniques.  It will prepares and encourages  students, especially
              women, minorities, and mature students, to  consider careers in science. 
              Without this grant,  implementation would have taken many years to accomplish.
