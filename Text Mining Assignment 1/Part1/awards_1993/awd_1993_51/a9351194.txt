Abstract    :
              9351194  Lindstrom                                                           A
              laboratory is being developed which will enable students  to carry out
              mathematical experiments and projects making use  of computers running the
              symbolic  manipulation/calculation/graphics package Mathematica.Students  write
              up their results and are often be encouraged to work  collaboratively. The math
              Lab is improving  education  by  helping students become excited about and
              committed to  mathematics ; providing students and instructors with the 
              resources to investigate more complex and realistic  applications of
              mathematics than can now be handled in class;  and giving students a grounding
              in the techniques and  possibilities of experimental mathematics.  ***
