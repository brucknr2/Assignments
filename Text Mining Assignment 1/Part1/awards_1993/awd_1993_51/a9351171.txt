Abstract    :
              This project will integrate across the curriculum the concepts,                
              practice, and specialized uses of gas chromatography                           
              instrumentation coupled with mass selective detection (GC/MS).                 
              Chemistry, biology, and pre-professional majors at all levels                  
              will see and/or learn how to utilize the power of this analysis                
              tool for identification and quantitation of unknown materials.                 
              New experiments that take advantage of the identification and                  
              structure elucidation capability of GC/MS will be incorporated                 
              in General Chemistry, Organic, Advanced Organic, and Advanced                  
              Inorganic courses.  The GC/MS will be an essential cornerstone                 
              instrument for the laboratory component of Environmental                       
              Chemistry, a new upper division course that will be offered for                
              the first time in 1993. In addition, a proposed middle- and                    
              high-school teacher education and outreach program that                        
              involves environmental science will be enhanced.
