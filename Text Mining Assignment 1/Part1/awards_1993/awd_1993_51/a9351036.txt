Abstract    :
              This project is designed to improve the laboratory component of                
              the ecology course. New laboratory exercises have enhanced the                 
              course and the project itself is allowing the inclusion of two                 
              laboratories on aquatic sampling techniques, and a laboratory                  
              on primary productivity using a portable photosynthesis system.                
              Computer simulations are being conducted to run laboratories                   
              with students working in teams, and videomicroscopy and video                  
              systems expose students to a wide variety of sampling                          
              procedures and habitat analyses. It is also expected that the                  
              project will significantly enhance other courses in ecology and                
              evolutionary biology at the institution.
