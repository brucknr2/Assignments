Abstract    :
              9351291  Vrudhula  The aim of this project is to establish an undergraduate 
              digital systems design laboratory with emphasis on VLSI. This  laboratory is
              part of a new two- course sequence offered to  seniors in computer engineering.
              The primary objectives of this  project are: (1) to expose the students to all
              aspects of  systems design, starting from the behavioral level down to the 
              layout level; and (2) to teach the fundamental engineering  discipline involved
              in evaluation, testing and redesign. These  primary objectives are being
              achieved by addressing the  following important aspects of systems design: (1)
              use of  multiple levels of abstraction; (2) methods of evaluating a  design in
              terms of performance, area, design time and cost at  each level; (3) examining
              tradeoffs among the possible choices  that are available at each level; (4)
              understanding the limits  of fabrication technology, causes and effects of
              failures and  fault models; and (5) understanding that design and test cannot 
              be separate activities by introducing design for testability.   The purpose of
              the laboratory is to provide hands on experience  through the use of the latest
              CAD tools and a computing  environment that reflects the state-of-the-art in
              industry. The  tools  eliminate much of the mundane aspects of the design and 
              allow the students to focus on the important high level design  issues.
              Theoretical knowledge and practical design experience  are carefully balanced
              through a set of realistic design  projects that involve the students in all
              aspects of systems  design. In addition, the laboratory provides for rapid 
              prototyping of the designs through the use of Field  Programmable Gate Arrays.
              This allows students to build,  exercise, and re-evaluate designs.  ***
