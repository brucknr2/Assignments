Abstract    :
              Mathematicians at Washington and Lee are developing an                         
              innovative course in tensor calculus as a sequel to an existing                
              course in vector calculus. They are creating computer                          
              laboratory and class materials that will support and supplement                
              both the existing vector calculus course as well as its sequel.                
              These subjects involve the study of quantifiable spatial                       
              relationships (as in physics) and related quantities plotted in                
              an abstract space (as in economics). Mathematicians have devel-                
              oped these concepts by quantifying their geometric intuition.                  
              This project plans to use mathematical computer graphics to                    
              cultivate such geometric intuition in students. Students will                  
              use computers as tools of investigation of vector calculus                     
              concepts and learn to visualize three dimensional shapes.
