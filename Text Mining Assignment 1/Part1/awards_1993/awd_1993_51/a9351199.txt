Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department will purchase a 200 MHz FT-NMR instrument             
              for use in four upper level chemistry laboratories and                         
              undergraduate research.  It will provide multinuclear capabilities             
              and the introduction of two-dimensional experiments. hands-on                  
              laboratory experience for our students. Thus, the acquisition of a             
              200 MHz NMR spectrometer will not only allow the Department to                 
              improve its curriculum in the theory and practice of nuclear                   
              magnetic resonance, but the instrument will also enable chemistry              
              majors to be trained in an important experimental technique for the            
              structural characterization of both organic and inorganic                      
              compounds.
