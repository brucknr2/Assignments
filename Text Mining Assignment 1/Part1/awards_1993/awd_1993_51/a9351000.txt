Abstract    :
              9351000  Gutnikov  In order to maintain the strength and currency of our 
              undergraduate analytical chemistry program, we are  incorporating into our
              curriculum practical work based on  capillary electrophoresis (CE).  This is
              enabling our students  to gain proficiency in this recently developed
              technique.  The  experiment which is being carried out in the Separations 
              Methods course has been carefully designed to illustrate the  complementary
              nature of CE to HPLC by demonstrating its utility  where liquid chromatography
              fails.  An automated unit is  permitting students to develop awareness of the
              greatly  increased workload achievable with a state-of-the-art  instrument. 
              Students also are being compelled to revise their  notions concerning the
              planning and design of experiments in  order to fully exploit the productive
              capacity of a computer-  controlled instrument.  The objectives in our ongoing
              research  programs and mandatory senior projects are being realized much  more
              expeditiously with the CE instrument.  ***
