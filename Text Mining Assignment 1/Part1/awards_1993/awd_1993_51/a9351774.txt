Abstract    :
              This project will implement a workstation laboratory where                     
              students can gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art                    
              software with Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools.                
              The CASE tools will be used in three required, upper level CIS                 
              classes: Systems Analysis, Systems Design, and Database Design.                
              In these courses real development projects are used, for                       
              example, designing an inventory system for a manufacturing                     
              company. The students experience the complete development life                 
              cycle by beginning the analysis of the system in the Systems                   
              Analysis course and designing/implementing the system in the                   
              Systems Design and in the Database Design courses.  Students                   
              will develop and/or work with data flow diagrams, entity                       
              relationships, input/output prototype/specifications,                          
              file/database structures, policies, procedures, structure                      
              charts, function point counts, objects, and object                             
              repositories. The multi-class project provides students with                   
              experience in project management, interpersonal skills and                     
              group dynamics.
