Abstract    :
              9351213  Elbert      A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with an
              energy-dispersive  spectrometer (EDS) is being used in the Geology Department. 
               This equipment is bringing modern imaging and mineral analysis  capabilities
              to the department enabling curricular  modernization in the petrology,
              mineralogy, geochemistry, and  introductory courses in the major program;
              enhancement of a new  course for non-geology, science majors; and improvement
              of the  senior-research program.  This modernization is providing  students an
              opportunity to work with the most common analytical  method used in modern
              petrologic and mineralogical research.   Ready access to a high-powered
              instrument in their course work  is encouraging students to pursue ideas,
              investigate their own  hypotheses, think for themselves, and discover new
              principles,  processes which parallel the fundamental methodology of  creative
              science.  ***y
