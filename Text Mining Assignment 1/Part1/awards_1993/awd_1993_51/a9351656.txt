Abstract    :
              The aim of the Mt. San Antonio College Math Lab Project is to                  
              revitalize Intermediate Algebra instruction by restructuring                   
              the Intermediate Algebra curriculum, modernizing course                        
              content, introducing weekly computer-based laboratory sessions                 
              into the course, and providing students with regular classroom                 
              computer mathematics demonstrations. The approach will                         
              eventually be expanded to include most mathematics courses.                    
              Students involved are being tracked, and an in depth study is                  
              being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach.                 
              A project implementation manual is being developed and                         
              distributed to all California Community Colleges.This project                  
              is significant because it addresses one of the most pressing                   
              issues facing community colleges today: the high attrition                     
              rates and poor achievement levels in lower division college                    
              mathematics.
