Abstract    :
              9351418  Mtenga  The objective of this project is to establish facilities for an
               undergraduate instructional laboratory in engineering mechanics  and
              structural engineering courses. The major items requested  in this project
              include:  - A universal test/demonstration frame, together with its 
              attachments. This is intended for experiments in vector statics  and strength
              of materials. Students are able to work on this  frame on their own as part of
              laboratory experience.  - A reduced-scale model loading frame, including
              loading  electo-mechanical actuators and data sensing devices, i.e.,  load
              cells, strain gauges and dial gauges. With the acquisition  of these loading
              frames students are able to build models and  test them in the laboratory, and
              thus appreciate structural  system performance.  - Computer software required
              for the design courses.  Student performance in the courses that are affected
              by the  facility is monitored and documented. In addition, performance  in
              other areas of study are monitored, since some of the  courses affected by the
              facility (vector statics and strength  of materials) are pre-requisites in
              other areas of the civil  engineering undergraduate program.  ***
