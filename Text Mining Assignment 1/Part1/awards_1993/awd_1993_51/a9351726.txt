Abstract    :
              9351726  Xiao  Recent advances in the field of optics should be reflected in 
              undergraduate science and engineering programs.  This is  presently
              accomplished at the University of Arkansas by  offering to students in science
              and engineering a series of  three courses: "Optics", "Laser Physics", and
              "Applied Non-  Linear Optics".  In "Optics" students develop a foundation of 
              both physical and wave optics, in "Laser Physics" students  develop specific
              skills in design, construction, and analysis  of different laser systems, while
              in "Applied Non-Linear  Optics" they utilize their skills to investigate
              concepts and  techniques that are finding widespread applications in science 
              and engineering.  The present program at Arkansas supports the  "Optics",
              "Laser Physics" and "Applied Non-Linear Optics"  courses by providing a strong
              laboratory experience.  The basic  project plan reinforces the interest and
              enthusiasm which is  piqued in the lecture and to give students the opportunity
              to  continue to develop their talents and their interests into  specific
              skills. The new laboratory program uses non-linear  optical materials as a
              vehicle to develop skills in (i)  Electro-, Magneto-, and Acousto-Optics; (ii)
              Optical Wave  Mixing; (iii) Photorefractive Phenomena; and (iv) Guided Waves 
              and Integrated Optics. In every case the equipment requested is  of the type
              which students encounter in research and  development laboratories engaged in
              optics related work.
