Abstract    :
                  CUNY Queensboro Community College is implementing a                        
              Connectivity Laboratory -- a cornerstone for future engineering                
              technology development and a model for other technology                        
              curricula. The laboratory is designed to support experiments in                
              connectivity, data communications, network technology, and                     
              multimedia networks. Six resource areas constitute the                         
              laboratory -- Student Stations, Instruction Resources,                         
              Connection Resources, Network Services, Multimedia Resources,                  
              and Display Resources. Four engineering technology courses are                 
              being scheduled to use the Connectivity Laboratory --                          
              Connectivity Fundamentals, Network Fundamentals, Network                       
              Technology, and Multimedia Networks.Each laboratory bench has                  
              EISA and MCA bus computers which may be configured as                          
              workstations and fileservers, using Ethernet, Tokenring, or                    
              peer-to-peer Ethernet protocols. These may be interconnected                   
              into various network topologies using a lObaseT concentrator,                  
              multimedia access center, Ethernet bridge, fiber optic/Token-                  
              ring MAU, and a Token-ring bridge.
