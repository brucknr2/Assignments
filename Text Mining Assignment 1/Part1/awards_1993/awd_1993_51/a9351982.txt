Abstract    :
              The project updates a curriculum designed almost totally around                
              organismal and field biology to include laboratory experiences                 
              in molecular biology. The lecture component of the course                      
              emphasizes the principles of molecular biology. The                            
              accompanying laboratory provides students intensive "hands-on"                 
              experience in the fundamental techniques of experimental                       
              molecular biology.
