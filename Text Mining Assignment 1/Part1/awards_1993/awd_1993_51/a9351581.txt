Abstract    :
              This project establishes a "Non-Destructive Testing Facility"                  
              at Maine Maritime Academy comprising of non-destructive testing                
              equipment commonly used in the marine construction industry.                   
              The object of this project is the development of a teaching                    
              tool which will assist in the understanding of material flaws                  
              and the importance of proper welding techniques. All                           
              engineering students at Maine Maritime academy are required to                 
              complete a sequence of courses in welding theory and practice.                 
              The Non-Destructive Testing Facility  will include liquid-dye                  
              penetrant, ultrasonic, magnetic-particle and x-ray equipment.                  
              Laboratory projects will include not only weld defect                          
              detection, but also corrosion assessment on board the Academy's                
              training vessel, effects of stress and fatigue and changes in                  
              anisotropic material structure during fabrication. The                         
              operation of the test-bench facility will provide students with                
              an additional hands-on capability in which the Maine Maritime                  
              Academy graduating engineer excels.
