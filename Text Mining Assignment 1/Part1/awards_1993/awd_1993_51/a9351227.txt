Abstract    :
              9351227  Powell  The Department is currently expanding its undergraduate 
              laboratory experiments in astronomy. The University has made a  commitment to
              construct a local observatory which will support  eight 8-inch telescopes and
              one 14-inch telescope. To provide  the most versatile observational astronomy
              laboratory possible,  each 8-inch telescope will be equipped with a CCD camera
              and  controlling computer. The 14-inch telescope will be equipped  with a
              larger format, higher dynamic range CCD for upper level  undergraduate classes
              and student research projects. The  combination of telescopes and CCD cameras
              will be used for  students to obtain experimental results for a color-magnitude
               diagram, variable stars, planets, and galaxies. The laboratory  experiments
              are designed to improve students' problem-solving  skills, provide experience
              with state-of-the-art technology,  and increase their awareness of scientific
              principles.  ***
