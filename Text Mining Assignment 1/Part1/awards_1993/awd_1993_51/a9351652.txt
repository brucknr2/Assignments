Abstract    :
              9351652  Tuchman  The Department of Biology has a diverse undergraduate 
              curriculum with the majority of the resources directed towards  courses and
              undergraduate research in health-related subjects  (e.g. Histology, Vertebrate
              Physiology, Microbiology, and  Neurobiology). We will enhance laboratories in
              limnology and  plant physiology using a configuration of microscopes and video 
              systems that will allow students to study plant cellular  process and the
              aquatic environment. The new laboratories will  use a compound microscope that
              magnifies within the range of  40X to 1670X, including feature for bright
              field, phase  contrast, Nomarski and fluorescence, and a stereoscope that 
              magnifies from 3.8X to 128X including fiber optics. Attached to  the microscope
              stages are video cameras.  Each unit also has  photographic capabilities. In
              addition, a video cassette  recorder with time-lapse capabilities will be used
              to record  responses to stimuli, behavior, and development. Thus, this 
              equipment will enhance the Department of Biology's ability to  provide a
              current state-of-the-art hands-on education to  undergraduate majors interested
              in pursuing non-health related  disciplines.  ***
