Abstract    :
              Parallel and distributed computing is a promising technology                   
              that affects the evolution of computer science and influences                  
              most aspects of modern life. Laboratories which train students                 
              in this emerging technology are essential. The proposed                        
              laboratory facility will enable us to provide our students with                
              experiences in shared memory, distributed memory, and network                  
              parallelism, implement our curricular development plan, and                    
              work closely with other educators in this rapidly changing                     
              field.
