Abstract    :
              9351879  Ghosh       The departments of biological sciences, chemistry, geology
              and  physics in the College of Science at Marshall University, a  predominantly
              undergraduate institution, plan to expand  students' laboratory experiences
              with modern scientific  instruments in instructional laboratory work and
              supervised  independent research. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer,  with
              graphite furnace and mercury/hydride accessories, along  with appropriate
              lamps, will be used by students in experiments  where quantitative
              determination of elemental concentrations at  extremely low levels is needed.
              This instrument will benefit  students in new and existing courses, will allow
              new  opportunities for undergraduate research, and in terms of cost  to benefit
              ratio, will be the most valuable instrument in the  College of Science.  ***
