Abstract    :
              It is proposed to design, purchase, and install a Data                         
              Acquisition Monitoring and Analysis System on the Maine                        
              Maritime tug boat, Pentagoet. This floating laboratory is                      
              equipped with two propulsion diesel engines. The object of this                
              project is the development of a teaching tool which will assist                
              in the monitoring and thermodynamic analysis of the performance                
              of these engines.  While the system will most heavily impact                   
              two lab courses, it will be used in a total of 10 couses in                    
              both demonstration and practice modes.
