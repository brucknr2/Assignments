Abstract    :
              This project will fabricate a design demonstration support                     
              system for use in undergraduate civil engineering education. A                 
              computation center and two physical modeling support centers                   
              will be fabricated for use with demonstration modules to enable                
              students to observe physical phenomena and failure mechanisms                  
              in soil. The project includes funds for data acquisition                       
              capabilities so that students will be able to obtain                           
              measurements of displacements, loads and pressures within soil                 
              in order to verify design procedures common in engineering                     
              practice. The apparatus will provide the opportunity to                        
              incorporate novel laboratory experiences and design projects                   
              into civil engineering education. Course modifications will be                 
              made in order to incorporate the laboratories into the                         
              geotechnical/ geoenvironmental program.  The laboratory                        
              demonstrations will enhance the students' understanding of                     
              material behavior and mathematical methods used to solve                       
              engineering problems. The behavior of soil and pore water will                 
              be observed in the laboratory. Failure mechanisms that are                     
              predicted from theory will be demonstrated. Flow paths and                     
              total heads will be observed in flow through porous media                      
              experiments. Mathematical solutions to governing differential                  
              equations which are used to solve engineering problems will be                 
              verified in the laboratory with the aid of the computation                     
              center.
