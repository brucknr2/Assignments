Abstract    :
              The Physics Department of Muhlenberg College is developing a                   
              workshop physics approach to the General Physics course.  The                  
              courses meet exclusively in the laboratory where students                      
              explore topics by performing a large number of computer                        
              assisted experiments.  Students learn by doing, while formal                   
              lectures have been abandoned.  In the past students generally                  
              played a very passive role in lecture courses and with this                    
              approach students are more involved in the learning process.                   
              They make the decisions on what variations of the basic                        
              experiments to perform, allowing students with different                       
              interests to explore different aspects of the topic being                      
              studied.  The course is structured around the computer                         
              interface Series 6500 system from Pasco Scientific, which also                 
              has a wide variety of compatible equipment specifically                        
              designed for the introductory lab.  We are phasing the new                     
              course in for all general physics students over a two to three                 
              year period.
