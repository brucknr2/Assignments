Abstract    :
              9351937  Kerlan  The objectives of this project are to: (1) demonstrate to our 
              students and colleagues the benefits of collaborative teaching  and learning;
              (2) promote an appreciation of the multiple and  integrated anatomical and
              physiological responses involved in  the functioning and survival of the whole
              organism (3) provide  opportunities for cooperative learning in problem solving
               course laboratories and (4) encourage new areas of faculty-  student research.
              The purchase of Macintosh IIvx personal  computers, NuVista frame grabber and
              BIOPAC data acquisition  systems, a Cameron Blood Gas Analyzer, Cole-Palmer
              refrigerated  bath, and Reichert-Jung cryostat will improve and expand 
              laboratories in three courses and undergraduate research. This  modern
              easy-to-use and precise equipment will support  anatomical and physiological
              laboratory experiments at the  cellular, tissue-organ and organismal level.
              This project is  significant because for the first time at this institution we 
              propose to bring together students from the Comparative  Vertebrate Anatomy and
              General Animal Physiology courses to  resolve interdisciplinary-based questions
              by integrating  concepts from complimentary disciplines. We anticipate that 
              faculty and student interest generated by our collaborative  teaching will
              continue as faculty-directed student research.        ***
