Abstract    :
              This is a semester-long project-based cell biology laboratory                  
              course designed to develop scientific thinking skills in                       
              undergraduates. In this laboratory course, the students learn                  
              to construct testable hypotheses, to quantitate and evaluate                   
              the significance of results, and to relate their research to                   
              what is currently known. These research concepts are developed                 
              around the principal investigator's area of research expertise,                
              cell membranes. One of three semester-long laboratories are                    
              offered each year, dealing with either differential protein                    
              solubilization from membranes, hormone-receptor interactions,                  
              or effects of lipid environment on membrane protein activity.                  
              The equipment requested, a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge,                 
              is necessary for these studies. The project directs students                   
              away from simply memorizing concepts and leads them to                         
              understand and then to apply scientific approaches to                          
              biological problems.
