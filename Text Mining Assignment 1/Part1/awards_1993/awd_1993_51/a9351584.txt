Abstract    :
              Videomicroscopy equipment is used for a variety of purposes in                 
              an upper level cell biology laboratory and for enhanced student                
              research projects: fluorescent microscopy is used for                          
              immunofluorescent localization of proteins in cells and                        
              fluorescent staining of membranes; phase contrast and DIC                      
              microscopy is used for observations on living cells; while a                   
              high resolution video system linked to a color thermal printer                 
              provides a rapid and relatively inexpensive documentation of                   
              microscopic images.  The videomicroscope system facilitates                    
              curricular changes which emphasize understanding science as a                  
              process.
