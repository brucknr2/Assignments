Abstract    :
              This project brings the Mathematica public-domain software                     
              Signal Processing Packages (SPP) to engineering, mathematics,                  
              and physics students who can use computers to speed up their                   
              learning process, to learn material on their own, to test                      
              themselves, to generate their own problems and answers. The                    
              University of the Pacific is setting up a laboratory with                      
              computers dedicated to SPP for students to do assigned                         
              problems. These computers are being used to complement and not                 
              to replace students' understanding of the basic principles                     
              involved. Thus, only after the students demonstrate they can                   
              solve problems in a certain area are they assigned computer                    
              problems in that area. SPP covers most areas taught in                         
              engineering and mathematics. Areas not covered by SPP are                      
              covered by Mathematica. This project is being designed liberate                
              students from the drudgery of repeated calculations. The                       
              student use the time saved to learn new material or do other                   
              homework.
