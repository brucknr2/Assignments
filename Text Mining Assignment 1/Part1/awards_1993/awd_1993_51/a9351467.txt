Abstract    :
              This project is upgrading the archaeological teaching                          
              laboratory in the Washburn Undergraduate Anthropology                          
              Laboratories at the institution. Based on the premises that                    
              modern archaeology is as much a laboratory as a field science,                 
              and that existing, extensive museum collections should be                      
              efficiently used in teaching, the project is also upgrading the                
              existing large teaching room in the Washburn Labs through the                  
              installation of student workstations. Each station is comprised                
              of a constellation of computer workstation (with relational                    
              database software), balance, calipers, and microscope. The                     
              workstations are also networked, and connected via a server to                 
              the campus-wide fiber optic network.  Dissemination of results                 
              includes preparation of laboratory manuals, and presentation of                
              papers and reports to colleagues at professional meetings.
