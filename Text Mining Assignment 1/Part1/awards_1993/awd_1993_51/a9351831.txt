Abstract    :
              9351831  Olowin                                                          A
              non-science major Introductory Astronomy Laboratory is being  equipped for
              on-going laboratory experience for undergraduate  students. An ensemble of
              telescopes and accessories enhance and  extend the direct experience
              undergraduates have with the sky.  Students have the opportunity to observe and
              measure celestial  bodies such as the sun, moon, planets, stars, bright
              clusters,  nebulae and galaxies directly as well as photograph, measure,  and
              analyze starlight for its composition, intensity, and time  variations. Six new
              8" telescopes, each equipped with a filar  micrometer, a simple spectroscope,
              and a photometer, are used  to augment observational work in the laboratory to
              a greater  degree than was previously possible. Two large-aperture  Dobsonian
              instruments complement the smaller aperture suite to  allow students to observe
              deep-sky objects in a hands-on, cost-  effective manner. The new telescopes not
              only greatly enhance  existing and planned curricular offerings at Saint Mary's
               College, but also serve as a community resource for primary and  secondary
              school training as well as a vehicle for public  viewing nights and programs
              offered through local community  centers.  ***
