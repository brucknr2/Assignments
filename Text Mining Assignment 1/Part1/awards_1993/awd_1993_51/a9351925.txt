Abstract    :
              "Real Time Microprocessor Application" uses solderless                         
              breadboards and test equipment to support a laboratory oriented                
              course in Microprocessor based design. Each student builds a                   
              68000 microprocessor based computer which is applied to real                   
              time systems (currently, distributed control of an electric                    
              train set). The instruction not only covers basic computer                     
              interface and operation, but will allow focus on interrupts and                
              their timing considerations, multi-tasking, priority levels,                   
              and communications issues. By having each student build up his                 
              own processor from the device level, students become more aware                
              of issues that can be overlooked with board level products.
