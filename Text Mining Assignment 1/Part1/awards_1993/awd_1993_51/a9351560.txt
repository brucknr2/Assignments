Abstract    :
              9351560  Chittenden       An atomic absorption spectrometer and
              thermogravimetric  analysis instrumentation are being used to greatly
              strengthen  the laboratory training in Quantitative Analysis, in two senior 
              level undergraduate courses, Instrumentation and Inorganic  Chemistry, and in
              our capstone undergraduate research course,  Special Problems in Chemistry. 
              Students are completing senior  theses based on their research projects.  The
              three senior  level courses, as an interrelated group, convey a strong 
              emphasis on environmental chemistry.  Particularly stressed are  the areas of
              water (surface, ground, and rain water) quality  and the inorganic synthesis
              and characterization of models for  hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts which
              are necessary for  the removal of sulfur from fossil fuels.  Environmental 
              chemistry, being broadly interdisciplinary in nature, is  providing a
              comprehensive view of the field of chemistry.  ***y
