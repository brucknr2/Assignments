Abstract    :
              A high-purity germanium detector system and PC-based                           
              multichannel analyzers have been added to the Nuclear                          
              Instruments and Methods Laboratory course to upgrade and                       
              improve it.  The germanium detector gives students experience                  
              with modern high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, and enables                
              them to undertake more advanced experiments. The PC-based                      
              multichannel analyzers make it possible for students to execute                
              experiments and data analysis at levels of sophistication                      
              common to research laboratories today.
