Abstract    :
              The chemistry department will purchase a GC-MS as a major                      
              instrument in the revamping of their curriculum to include                     
              increased exposure to modern instrumentation. Incorporation of                 
              experimental work involving gas chromatography and mass                        
              spectrometry will begin with the freshman course for majors and                
              continue through organic chemistry and quantitative analysis.                  
              It will then be utilized in the project oriented unified lab                   
              sequence and in senior research projects.
