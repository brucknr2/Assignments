Abstract    :
              This project is developing a program at the institution to                     
              improve laboratory instruction in plant biology. Improvements                  
              focus on shifting the emphasis from demonstration based lab                    
              exercises to experimentation. Specific introductory courses                    
              involve General Botany and General Biology which are designed                  
              for majors and non-majors, respectively. Proposed changes in                   
              the upper division course, Plant Physiology, have also                         
              strengthened the laboratory component by emphasizing the                       
              integration of cellular, leaf and whole plant processes and by                 
              incorporating a research component, including writing, into the                
              existing laboratory structure. In addition, the project is                     
              expected to expand existing opportunities for collaborative                    
              research between faculty and students and to increase interest                 
              in independent research.
