              project will purchase equipment for a chromatography teaching  station that
              consists of gas chromatography (GC), high performance  liquid chromatography
              (HPLC), and an HPLC simulation program. The  teaching station will be used to
              introduce chromatography in a  developmental and experiential way throughout
              the chemistry  laboratory curriculum.  During the advanced courses, students
              will  modify instrumentation to obtain more sophisticated results.  The 
              teaching station will be interfaced with a microcomputer to allow  data
              acquisition, analysis and
