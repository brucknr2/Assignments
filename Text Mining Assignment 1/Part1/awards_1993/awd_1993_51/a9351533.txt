Abstract    :
              9351533  Palmer                                    This project supports the
              development of an undergraduate  laboratory in radio science. The radio science
              facility would  join a night time optical observatory and a student solar 
              observatory (based on a heliostat) as alternatives to the  traditional physical
              science laboratories: as opportunities for  non-science majors to work with and
              master a piece of state of  the art instrumentation. The University has a radio
              antenna  which was installed and outfitted with low noise amplifiers and  a
              continuum radiometer at Departmental expense. With relatively  modest
              additional expenditure, two major new areas of activity  are being opened up to
              students: radio frequency spectroscopy  of interstellar gas and radar and
              communications studies based  on reflecting signals from the moon.  The radio
              facility  furthers the teaching of non-science majors in three important  ways:
              first, in the laboratory situation, many fundamental  concepts such as
              wavelength, the electromagnetic spectrum,  black body radiation, and absorption
              lines, become much more  concrete because they relate to things students can
              see and  "play around with"; second, by participating in the same type  of
              activities as do modern astronomers, students gain a clearer  idea of how
              science is actually done; and, third, this type of  laboratory has proved to
              hold the interest of the students much  better than do the traditional
              laboratories.  The spectrometer  designed and built in this project can be
              replicated at very  modest cost. printed circuit boards, plans, and software
              are  being made available to other interested institutions.  ***
