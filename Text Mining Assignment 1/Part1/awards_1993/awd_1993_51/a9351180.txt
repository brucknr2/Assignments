Abstract    :
              9351180  Friedman  The Howard Community College Science Department will upgrade 
              its computer-based experimental laboratory to promote real-  life, real-time
              problem-solving in its science classes.  While  the specifics will vary in each
              discipline, the new laboratory  equipment will allow HCC:  1. To acquire
              probeware that will allow the collection and  manipulation of real-world data
              for problem-solving and  conceptual model building exercises;  2. To
              incorporate more real-world multimedia instruction into  computer-based
              simulations, experiments, and problems;  3. To utilize real-time data analysis
              and manipulation tools to  improve student facility with and comprehension of
              laboratory  observations and information.  The equipment will support a
              flexible laboratory operation that  will serve approximately 2,500 annually.
              The laboratory will  also be used for professional development for K-12
              teachers as  well as a showcase for other area colleges.  ***
