Abstract    :
              9351600  Zilinskas   The project focuses on two core courses of the
              Biotechnology  Curriculum, Methods in Recombinant DNA Technology and Molecular 
              Genetics Laboratory.  The course is taken by students in the  expanding
              Biotechnology Curriculum, as well as students in  related disciplines, and
              provides the opportunity for hands-on  experience with the latest technology in
              this field.  ***y
