Abstract    :
              9351639  Burke         This project is improving the quality of instruction in
              the  Minot State University Psychology curriculum. Psychology's  previous
              affiliation with the Education Department necessitated  a curriculum centered
              on supporting the goal of teacher  training. As a separate department,
              Psychology has now  diversified its curriculum to include core courses in which
              a  laboratory experience for our students is essential.  Minot  State's
              students primarily come from rural areas, where  exposure to psychology is
              limited and experience with  laboratory facilities is nil. The majority of our
              psychology  majors are female (71%), and ten percent of their majors are 
              Native Americans who have had little educational opportunity to  work with
              laboratory equipment. This project is allowing Minot  State's Psychology
              Department to establish a psychological  laboratory with computers providing
              the major experiential  base. With modern technology, students are simulating 
              experiments, equipment, and physiological dissecting at a great  cost savings
              to the university and with adaptability for the  future. This project is giving
              students the opportunity to  dramatically increase their understanding of
              Psychology as a  science.  ***
