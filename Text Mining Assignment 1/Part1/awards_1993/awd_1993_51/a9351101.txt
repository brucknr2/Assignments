Abstract    :
              This project enhances an existing instrumentation and control                  
              curriculum to enhance laboratory activities in Electronics                     
              Technology, an engineering related program within the College                  
              of Technology at Bowling Green State University.  Specifically,                
              students will gain the ability to construct models of a                        
              physical system based on theoretical calculations. These models                
              will be exercised and performance data collected. The students                 
              will then reconcile the discrepancies between the model and the                
              physical system. In addition to serving the Electronics                        
              Technology students, Computer Science students who minor in                    
              microcomputer specialization are required to take courses that                 
              will use the laboratory workstations.
