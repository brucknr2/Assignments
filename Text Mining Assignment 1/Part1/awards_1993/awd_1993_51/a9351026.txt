Abstract    :
              A VLSI laboratory and design courses are being developed for                   
              the electrical and computer engineering curriculum. These                      
              courses provide students with experience in the development of                 
              VLSI-chip products. In this setting, students form teams and                   
              undertake the whole design process: logic design, gate-level,                  
              layout-level, simulation/verification, test generation, and                    
              testing of the returned prototype chips. The proposed courses                  
              emphasize the importance of quality in the IC products,                        
              particularly testing. Students adopt the concept of concurrent                 
              engineering early in their studies of the design and testing                   
              techniques, and problems that  arise in the manufacturing and                  
              mass production of the ICs are considered and solved. Design-                  
              for-test techniques are studied and their actual                               
              implementation, which makes the IC-chip products easy to test,                 
              are carried out by the design teams.The items requested                        
              comprise a benchtop ASIC tester and  logic verification and                    
              test generation CAD software, which are essential for the                      
              implementation of Design-for-Test laboratory courses.
