              project has established a micro computer classroom with several workstations to
              enhance the teaching of undergraduate economics. The classroom itself is
              integrated into the College's existing computer network and into the
              Department's curriculum. There is access to a VAX minicomputer, and classroom
              materials can also be accessed from the dormitories. It is expected that
              integration of the classroom into the Department's curriculum will add new
              application and interaction techniques to teaching material that is now
              presented in a lecture format. The computer classroom is being used in twelve
              sections each semester, and students learn to use the computer to enhance their
              economics and statistics. In addition, students have access to micro computers
              outside of normal class periods to complete class assignments and projects. ***
