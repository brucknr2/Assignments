Abstract    :
              With the growth in complexity of today's computer applications,                
              there is a need for increased computing power, not only in                     
              supercomputers, but also for other types of computers,                         
              including personal computers. Scientists and researchers agree                 
              that parallel processing represents the only way to increase                   
              computer speeds dramatically. They also believe that parallel                  
              processing will be the architecture of choice for future high                  
              performance computers. To prepare for the future, new                          
              scientists and engineers need to learn the architecture and                    
              programming of parallel systems at the undergraduate level. The                
              goal of this project is to teach undergraduate students in                     
              electrical engineering the fundamental concepts of architecture                
              and programming of systems with parallel processing. In order                  
              to be most effective and provide the strongest learning                        
              experiences, lectures in parallel processing should be coupled                 
              with well-planned, coordinated laboratory studies and                          
              experimentation. This proposed project will enable students to                 
              understand and to have hands-on experience on systems with                     
              parallel architectures through integrated lectures and                         
              laboratory experiments.
