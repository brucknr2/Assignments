Abstract    :
              This project gives new direction to the engineering materials                  
              course by greatly enhancing the students ability to engage in                  
              quantitative evaluation of mechanical and structural                           
              properties.  A computer-controlled Instron tester will allow                   
              for the more detailed quantitative study of a greatly expanded                 
              set of materials  under a variety of load conditions (e.g.,                    
              tension, compression, flexure, and cyclic).
