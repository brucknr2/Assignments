Abstract    :
              Creation of a New Social Science Computer Laboratory                            
                 This project involves a state-of-the-art networked social                  
              science computer laboratory. The laboratory facility is being                  
              used by social science majors, and has improved the                            
              scientific/computer training of social science undergraduates.                 
              The project uses a multidisciplinary approach and impacts                      
              undergraduates in political science, geography, sociology, and                 
              psychology. It is also expected to enhance other undergraduate                 
              courses, technology, training in data analysis and methodology                 
              commonly used in the social sciences.
