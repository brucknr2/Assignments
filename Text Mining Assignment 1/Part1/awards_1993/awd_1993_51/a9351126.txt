Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to revise our introductory statistics                
              courses in order to teach them as laboratory science courses                   
              emphasizing interactive computer graphics and real data. Some                  
              sections will focus on the sciences, some on economics, and                    
              some on sociology and political science.The major purchases                    
              will be: new statistical software; seventeen 486, 50MHz PCs                    
              with high quality graphics for running the new software; and a                 
              large disk to link to an existing file server for holding many                 
              data sets and student work on a wide variety of topics. The                    
              purchases will equip a statistics laboratory in new space                      
              provided by the construction this year of a building for                       
              computing, mathematics, and statistics.Inexpensive, powerful                   
              personal computers now make it possible to bring into the                      
              undergraduate lab iterative methods for describing data,                       
              resampling methods for inference, improved methods for testing                 
              fit of models, and color graphics to enhance intuitive                         
              understanding and pattern recognition. The large disk will be                  
              tied to a file server now on hand and networked to the                         
              student's computers, giving students access to a data library                  
              and software, and linking them throughout this campus and                      
              campuses nationwide.This project will establish an interactive                 
              learning environment where students will work in groups to pose                
              questions, analyze data, discuss and especially to write about                 
              their conjectures, observations, and conclusions. Using real                   
              data will provide the excitement of discovery, will connect                    
              statistics to their real-life experience and other courses, and                
              will demonstrate the usefulness and power of data analysis.
