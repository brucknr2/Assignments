Abstract    :
              The laboratory experiences are linked to the lecture                           
              presentation by incorporating laboratory video images into the                 
              computer assisted multimedia presentations. The multimedia                     
              presentation program has the flexibility to retrieve laboratory                
              images for display at any point in the lecture.  A computer                    
              driven video system enhances microscopy, dissection,                           
              demonstrations and experiments. The laboratory exercises are                   
              displayed live on the closed circuit video system and selected                 
              segments are stored on computer disc or video tape for further                 
              analysis or review. The video system captures, stores and                      
              instantly retrieves rare microscopic motions and other unique                  
              laboratory observations.  Images are enlarged, and then                        
              compared in split screen.
