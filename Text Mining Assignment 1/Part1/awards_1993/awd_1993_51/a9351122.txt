Abstract    :
              The University of West Florida will purchase a JASCO Model J-                  
              710 Circular Dichroism Spectrometer with Optical Rotatory                      
              Dispersion accessory for the rapid determination of chiroptical                
              spectra and optical activity. The instrument requested will                    
              permit the study of chirality in organic, inorganic,                           
              biochemical and polymeric materials. The equipment will be used                
              in seven undergraduate courses covering biochemistry, organic,                 
              inorganic and physical chemistry. It will be utilized for                      
              undergraduate research, and is expected to be used in a new                    
              laboratory course in polymer chemistry currently under                         
              development. Sophomores, juniors and seniors will study the                    
              structure and stereochemical features of a variety of compounds                
              including materials of biochemical interest. The approach will                 
              provide innovative means of helping students understand the                    
              important concepts of stereochemistry.
