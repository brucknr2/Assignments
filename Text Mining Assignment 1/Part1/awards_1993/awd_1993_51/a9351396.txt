Abstract    :
              Undergraduate science education for students majoring in                       
              science                                                                        
              and engineering, and students who are non-science majors must                  
              evolve to bring all students in contact with the tools needed                  
              to grasp critical and emerging scientific issues. In 1991 the                  
              University of Arizona started a two-semester sequence                          
              Introduction to Global Change to teach non-science majors about                
              the earth system. The course teaches basic scientific                          
              principles in the context of global problems and challenges                    
              facing scientists, policy makers and citizens alike. This                      
              proposal provides for the computer equipment needed to fully                   
              implement the laboratory exercises that we have developed and                  
              are continuing to improve. Besides this introductory course,                   
              undergraduate classes in global change, remote sensing, and                    
              hydrology will use the computer laboratory to enhance and                      
              expand their laboratory experiences. This multidisciplinary                    
              teaching effort is part of the University of Arizona's                         
              commitment to the study of global change.
