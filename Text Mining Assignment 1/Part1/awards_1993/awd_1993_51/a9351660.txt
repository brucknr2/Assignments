Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to improve the teaching of                         
              biomechanics in undergraduate physical education courses, and                  
              to improve the quality of independent studies completed by                     
              undergraduate physical education students. The grant assisted                  
              in purchasing a Video Analysis System that allows the                          
              quantitative kinematic analysis of movement, and the graphical                 
              presentation of data superimposed over a video image of skill                  
              performance. Classroom instruction is being improved by the                    
              system since mechanical principles such as the work-energy                     
              relationship can be graphically presented in relation to skill                 
              acquisition, pathological movement patterns, injury mechanisms,                
              and errors in skill performance. The video system supplements                  
              existing laboratory equipment for the measurement of force and                 
              muscle activity, and it allows undergraduate students to                       
              conduct independent projects quantifying both kinematic                        
              (movement patterns) and kinetic (forces affecting movement)                    
              aspects of human movement.
