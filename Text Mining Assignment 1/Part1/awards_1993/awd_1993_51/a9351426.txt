Abstract    :
              The project will develop and implement undergraduate                           
              experiments in surface analysis using the technique scanning                   
              tunneling microscopy (STM). Although characterization of                       
              surfaces is a central activity of many chemists in the                         
              chemical, semiconductor, petroleum, polymer and biotechnology                  
              industries, it remains a subject which is rarely addressed in                  
              undergraduate coursework at institutions throughout the U.S.                   
              Because STM is capable of surface imaging under ambient                        
              conditions (instead of under high vacuum) and due to the recent                
              introduction of low cost commercial instructional STM                          
              instruments, it is now possible to implement a meaningful                      
              experience in surface analytical chemistry at the undergraduate                
              level. Students will image standard materials at atomic                        
              resolution, and then examine a modified surface at low                         
              resolution, thus gaining exposure to tunneling phenomena,                      
              surface visualization and image processing software.
