Abstract    :
              The project will acquire a Fourier Transform NMR spectrometer                  
              to be used in laboratory curriculum development.  New                          
              experiments will be introduced across the curriculum including                 
              an introductory experiment for the freshman majors' lab,                       
              correlation spectroscopy at the sophomore level and unique                     
              investigations of the spectra of methylated tellurium compounds                
              and palladium-gold cluster compounds in the advanced lab.  The                 
              programs will prepare students for graduate work or industrial                 
              employment in chemistry.
