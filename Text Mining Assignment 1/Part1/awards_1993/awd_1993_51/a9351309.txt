Abstract    :
              9351309  Mantena                              This project will improve the
              structures and dynamics laboratory by  expanding the laboratory's capabilities
              to include characterization  of the mechanical properties of advanced materials
              (such as  composites) and frequency domain testing.  Specifically, a Fast 
              Fourier Transform based impulse-frequency response vibration  technique and
              modal analysis experiments will provide the seniors  with a "hands on"
              experience for evaluating the dynamic  characteristics of advanced materials
              and structures.
