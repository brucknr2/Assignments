Abstract    :
              This project is to implement a professional workstation                        
              laboratory for the new, interdisciplinary, undergraduate course                
              sequence in massively parallel computing which is being                        
              introduced this year with support from the NSF ?CDR/CISE!. The                 
              laboratory will be equipped with advanced software tools on a                  
              network of high performance graphics workstations from which                   
              the students will access the University's massively parallel                   
              computer. The workstations have been choosen for their                         
              computational speed and 3D graphics capabilities. In addition                  
              to the basic software package, which includes C, C++, Pascal,                  
              FORTRAN, X11 and Motif, the PIs plan to provide Mathematica,                   
              Linda and ID to ensure a full spectrum of tools for a                          
              professional high performance computing environment. The                       
              workstations will be used to gain access to the CM-5 complex,                  
              for the visualization of Connection Machine computations and                   
              results, for program development, for data preparation and                     
              analysis, and for studying networked distributed computing                     
              models.  The laboratory, which will be designed to serve as                    
              both a workspace and demonstration/teaching environment,is                     
              intended to reinforce the interdisciplinary nature of the                      
              curriculum by establishing a central location for the full                     
              range of interdepartmental undergraduate activity connected                    
              with the new curriculum.  The PIs believe that this project                    
              will demonstrate the viability of incorporating frontier                       
              technologies into undergraduate education and serve as a                       
              prototype from which other educators can borrow.
