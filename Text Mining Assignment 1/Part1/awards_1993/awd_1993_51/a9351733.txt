Abstract    :
              9351733  Retelle  A recording CTD, an acoustic sub-bottom profiling system, and 
              a magnetic susceptibility system are being used in the analysis  of sedimentary
              processes and stratigraphy in lacustrine and  nearshore marine environments. 
              The addition of this equipment  is allowing for development of field and lab
              exercises in  courses in Sedimentology, Glacial, and Quaternary Geology, in 
              two current field courses, and in faculty-student research.   The CTD unit is
              being used to monitor controls on modern  sediment transport and deposition
              such as salinity,  temperature, and oxygen in the water column.  The acoustic
              sub-  bottom profiler is an "echo-sounding" system that is being used  to
              obtain detailed continuous records of sediment fill in  transects across the
              lake or marine basins.  The magnetic  susceptibility system is being used to
              determine the  magnetostratigraphy of sediment cores recovered from the lakes 
              and marine basins which will subsequently provide a means for  correlation of
              cores within the basin.  The new equipment is  greatly strengthening our
              existing program of environmental and  paleoenvironmental studies by
              introducing students to modern  sedimentological and stratigraphical techniques
              that provide  detailed information on sedimentary processes and depositional 
              environments.  ***
