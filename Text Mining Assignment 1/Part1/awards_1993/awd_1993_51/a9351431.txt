Abstract    :
              9351431  Busler      The project will introduce a Fourier-transform nuclear
              magnetic  resonance spectrometer into the undergraduate curriculum for 
              Chemistry majors and other students.  The requested instrument  will not only
              permit the resumption of standard NMR experiments  but the introduction of
              numerous new experiments never before  possible. The experiments will be
              performed by undergraduate  students in several courses at CBU, including
              Organic,  Physical, Analytical, and Biochemistry, as well as in original 
              student research projects.  ***
