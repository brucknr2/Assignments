Abstract    :
              The project will use NMR methods as a basis for the development                
              and implementation of a new integrated laboratory course                       
              designed for advanced undergraduate chemistry students. This                   
              course will consist of fourteen experiments, the vast majority                 
              of which will involve elements of both chemical synthesis and                  
              the application of sophisticated instrumental analysis                         
              techniques. It will replace individual advanced laboratory                     
              courses in organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, instrumental                
              analysis, and physical chemistry. The exercises were chosen to                 
              be representative of research problems in chemistry and                        
              biochemistry, thereby introducing students to the excitement of                
              modem experimentation in these areas.  Specific applications                   
              include multi-nuclear characterization of synthetic products,                  
              the use of NMR methods in a kinetic determination, the                         
              determination of reaction enantioselectivity with chiral shift                 
              reagents, and studies of structure, conformation, and solution                 
              dynamics using NOE and two-dimensional techniques. In several                  
              cases students will be encouraged to choose their own experi-                  
              mental approach, and we will emphasize the importance of                       
              meeting as a group to share data and observations.
