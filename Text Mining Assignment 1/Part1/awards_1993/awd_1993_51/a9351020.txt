Abstract    :
              9351020  Davis  A number of very basic pieces of equipment are being used to 
              support two applied hydrogeology courses in the Department of Earth  Sciences &
              Physics.  The new field laboratory courses,  Environmental Site Assessment and
              Field Methods in Hydrogeology,  are creating a link between the theory and
              problem solving  techniques learned in hydrogeology lecture and discussion
              courses.   These field experiences are showing the interrelationship of water 
              quality and quantity, and the interconnection of surface water and  ground
              water systems, and represent a significant enhancement of  the undergraduate
              program in Earth Sciences.  The new courses are  making use of a
              spectrophotometer for use in colorimetric analysis,  a digital titrator, a
              digital pH meter, a conductivity/total  dissolved solids meter, a down-hole
              probe, and two water-level  measuring devices.   ***
