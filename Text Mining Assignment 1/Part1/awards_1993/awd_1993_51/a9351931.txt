Abstract    :
              We are upgrading and modernizing non-calculus and calculus-                    
              based elementary physics undergraduate laboratory courses in                   
              mechanics, electromechanics and optics.  This involves revision                
              of the laboratory curriculum, development and acquisition of                   
              related instructional equipment including computer-based data-                 
              acquisition systems and integration of data-analysis and CAI                   
              software with laboratory work.
