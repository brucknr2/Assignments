Abstract    :
              9351813  Wygant                                                             The
              purpose of this project is to use portable oxygen and heart  rate equipment to
              improve the ergonomic components of four  undergraduate courses. The telemetric
              data gathering system  requested in this grant will allow undergraduate
              students to  perform ergonomic and physiological experiments on-site, in local 
              industries. Typical projects that students will work on with the  portable
              equipment will include:  1.                                 Energy expenditure
              measurement                                     for physically demanding jobs. 
              2.                                 Cardiac measurement and                     
                             evaluation of alternative                                    
              ergonomic task designs.  3.                                 Biomechanical and  
                                                physiological job analysis of                
                                  industrial operations.  4.                                
              Job stress analysis of                                     different tool and
              machine                                     designs.  5.                       
                       Job evaluation of work task                                     for
              improvements in enabling                                     technologies and
              assistance                                     with conformance with the       
                                           Americans with Disabilities                       
                           Act (ADA).  Expanding laboratory experiments to include data
              collection from  actual work sites will enhance students' educational
              experiences  and provide a stronger foundation for them to become practicing 
              engineers. Giving students multiple opportunities to work on-site  throughout
              their undergraduate engineering program will allow them  to gain the
              perspective of real world problem solving. We believe  this will greatly
              strengthen the undergraduate engineering  curricula.
