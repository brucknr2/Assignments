Abstract    :
              9351214  Tinker      Four water-table observation wells and piezometers are
              being  installed on campus in order to enhance undergraduate  instruction in
              hydrogeology and water resources.  Using the  wells, physical hydrogeology
              students are determining in the  field the hydrologic properties of the aquifer
              including  ground-water flow directions and velocities.  Slug and pumping 
              tests, ground-water sampling techniques, and downhole  geophysical methods are
              being used by these students.  Chemical  hydrogeology students are collecting
              and comparing the water  chemistry from lysimeters, ground-water wells, and
              surface  waters to determine the chemical differences between ground and 
              surface waters.  Students are collecting and utilizing  hydrogeological
              parameters for capture zone and wellhead  protection strategies.  Water
              resource students are utilizing  the ground-water wells to determine the
              hydrologic  relationships between surface and groundwater and their effect  on
              a local flood-control structure.  ***y
