Abstract    :
                  Many types of research in psychology involve the use of                    
              computers for generating stimulus materials and encoding and                   
              analyzing empirical results. In order to adequately instruct                   
              and train students in conducting research in psychology it is                  
              essential that they be exposed to computer-based experiments.                  
              The University of California at Riverside is establishing a                    
              computer-based lab for the undergraduate research methods                      
              course required of all undergraduate psychology majors in the                  
              Psychology Department.  Demonstrations and experiments on                      
              cognition, perception, human-computer interaction, social                      
              psychology, psycholinguistics, and learning and memory are                     
              being developed and implemented for undergraduate labs in                      
              research methods. In addition, the equipment is available for                  
              instructional demonstrations for courses in these topical areas                
              of psychology.
