Abstract    :
              This project enhances current laboratory capabilities with                     
              spectrophotometric instrumentation which feature rapid and                     
              efficient data acquisition and processing (a computer                          
              interfaced scanning UV/Vis spectrophotometer and an atomic                     
              absorption spectrophotometer).  Experiments are designed to                    
              introduce techniques widely used in the workplace and in                       
              graduate schools.  Eleven Biology Department laboratory courses                
              have been  substantially upgraded.
