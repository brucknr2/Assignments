Abstract    :
              To best prepare students for roles in industry, they must be                   
              exposed to the latest technologies and have access to                          
              experiments where they become familiar with the type of                        
              equipment commonly used in Industry.  The current Robotics                     
              Laboratory, having only rigid robot gripper systems, offers the                
              students a limited experience in the area of robotic assembly.                 
              The aim of this project is to provide students with the state-                 
              of-the-art tools required for light-weight robotic assembly.                   
              This will be accomplished by the acquisition of an automatic                   
              quick-change gripper system, a parallel closure two-finger                     
              gripper, a self-centering three-finger gripper and a Remote                    
              Center Compliance (RCC) compensator.  This equipment will                      
              directly support three undergraduate courses: Robotics, Design                 
              for Manufacture, and the Senior Design Project.
