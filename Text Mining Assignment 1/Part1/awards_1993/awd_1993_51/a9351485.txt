              Acquisition of a FTIR spectrophotometer will allow the introduction  and
              development of hands-on instrumental structural analysis in the  organic
              laboratory. The FTIR and associated software will also  provide the students
              with computer assisted data collection,  manipulation, and spectral data base
              searching. Organic Chemistry  students will use the instrument to identify
              unknowns, follow  reaction progress, identify products, and help establish
              purity of  synthesized compounds. General Chemistry students will use the 
              instrument to identify functional groups in an introduction to  Organic
              Chemistry. The project will overcome a major deficiency in  the current
              laboratory curriculum by introducing the students to  FTIR techniques that are
              widely used in Chemistry.
