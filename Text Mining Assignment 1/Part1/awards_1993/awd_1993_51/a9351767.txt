Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science proposes to                 
              establish a Computer Architecture Laboratory around single-                    
              board computers. This project has, as its dual objectives, an                  
              improvement in the quality of the undergraduate Computer                       
              Science program and an increase in the success rate of students                
              in that program. The project will develop a laboratory in which                
              students can acquire some hands-on experience with single-board                
              computers, minimizing the layers of hardware and system                        
              software between the user and the microprocessor. The                          
              laboratory will enable the students to grasp the concepts of                   
              computer hardware and computer systems organization more                       
              effectively than learning the concepts in the abstract.                        
              Educational materials to be developed by the project will                      
              integrate the laboratory with the current Computer Science                     
              curriculum.
