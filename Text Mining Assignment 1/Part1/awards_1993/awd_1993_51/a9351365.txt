Abstract    :
              Three sets of optical spectrum analyzers are being used for                    
              this project; one for each of the three work stations in the                   
              electro-optics laboratory. That laboratory is used for two                     
              undergraduate laboratory courses which have a total annual                     
              enrollment of about 105 students. In addition, about 20 senior                 
              projects and 10 directed independent studies are completed in                  
              that laboratory annually.The new equipment is being used by                    
              students for trouble shooting and as a means of graphically                    
              displaying and analyzing the spectra of optical sources,                       
              modulated optical signals, and what is happening to such                       
              signals at various points in an optical network. A total of                    
              three new experiments are being introduced, enabling the                       
              students to gain practical experience in characteristics of                    
              optical sources, longitudinal modes of the laser,                              
              photodetectors and spectral characteristics of fiber optic                     
              networks. The experience gained in using optical spectrum                      
              analyzers is stimulating and expanding undergraduate learning                  
              in electro-optics.
