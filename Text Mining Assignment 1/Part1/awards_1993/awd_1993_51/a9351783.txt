Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of a physical geography                  
              laboratory by using computer equipment and environmental                       
              sensors. This is also being accomplished in conjunction with                   
              course modifications to allow undergraduates more involvement                  
              in empirical work. Curricular modification focuses on                          
              introductory level courses in Physical Geography and Weather                   
              and Climate, making them laboratory courses in which the                       
              exercises are computer dependent. Meteorological sensors at a                  
              weather station also feed data directly to the lab and the data                
              sets are used to examine temporal variations in weather. It is                 
              expected that the equipment acquired under this project will be                
              used in other advanced physical geography courses and that it                  
              will be available for students in independent research                         
              projects.
