Abstract    :
              9351403  Hall   The project will purchase visible spectrophotometers for use in 
              the freshman course as well as Fourier transform infrared (FT-  IR)
              spectrometer for the freshman and sophomore organic course.   This equipment
              will allow a major upgrade in the chemistry  offering at this two year college.
               This is part of a  continuing effort, begun in 1989 to upgrade the chemistry 
              curriculum and has included the introduction of microscale  experiments which
              will be enhanced by the proposed  instrumentation.       ***
