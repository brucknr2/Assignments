Abstract    :
              9351763  Wittman  This project has established a well-equipped, quantitatively 
              oriented laboratory for undergraduate instruction in applied  economics. 
              Emphasis is being placed on in-depth training in  empirical research techniques
              that includes econometrics and  experimental approaches.  Specifically, funds
              are being used to  establish an applied economics laboratory course that will
              be  required of all economics majors, and to develop a modular  experimental
              workshop into the curriculum.  It is expected that  the project will produce
              instructional units with software,  data, instructions, and a laboratory text. 
              Also, this applied  economics course could serve as a model for other economics
               departments, and the experimental modules, themselves, could be  taught by
              other experimentalists at other institutions.         ***
