Abstract    :
              Molecular graphics provides state of the art training to                       
              undergraduates in biochemistry, plant science, genetics,                       
              chemistry, animal science and nutrition.  Students' ability to                 
              understand the chemistry and function of molecules is enriched                 
              by experiments which combine laboratory experiments with                       
              graphics exploration of molecular interactions.
