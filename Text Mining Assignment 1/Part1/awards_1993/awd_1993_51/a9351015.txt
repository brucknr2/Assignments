Abstract    :
              A revolutionary teaching microscope will be introduced into the                
              introductory biology laboratory classroom as part of a major                   
              revision of the curriculum. The efficiency and dramatic effect                 
              of this instrument has been demonstrated in a pilot project,                   
              Exploring Microstructures: Introducing Biology Students and                    
              Teachers to Images, Tools and Applications of High-Tech                        
              Microscopy. The technologically-advanced microscope consists of                
              a tiny, hand-held, self-illuminated video camera with                          
              interchangeable magnifying lenses attached by a fiber optics                   
              cable to a television monitor. By touching the tip of the lens                 
              to any object under scrutiny, a user of any age or ability                     
              immediately produces a well-lighted, in-focus image of the                     
              appropriate magnification on a regular television monitor. This                
              tool will improve the investigative biology laboratory for non-                
              science majors. Video recordings can be made in the normal                     
              fashion.The number of applications that can be developed is                    
              virtually unlimited and will serve as a generator of ideas for                 
              K-12 as well as undergraduate curricula. The preliminary                       
              excitement elicited by the entry of our pilot scope into K-12                  
              and undergraduate classrooms merits the expansion of the                       
              program into this larger scale project.
