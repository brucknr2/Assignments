Abstract    :
              9351010  Velbel      A suite of microscopes equipped with thermal stages is
              being  used to develop and calibrate a simple, innovative laboratory  activity
              on the temperature dependence (Arrhenius activation  energy) of
              mineral-solution reactions.  The exercise is  enabling students in
              undergraduate mineralology/geochemistry  courses to directly measure reaction
              rates at various  temperatures while simultaneously allowing them to observe
              the  evolution of grain-surface morphology during the reaction.   This is
              greatly improving student understanding of several  basic principles of
              chemical kinetics directly relevant to the  geological sciences, including
              diffusion, the temperature  dependance of reaction rates, and the relationship
              between  rate-limiting mechanisms and crystal-surface morphology.  The  lab
              exercise is generating dynamic (real-time) geochemical rate  data which
              students then are using to augment traditional  quantitative homework
              exercises. Furthermore, the equipment is  being used to calibrate a
              technologically much less complicated  version of the exercise.  Any geology
              department with  microscopes, hot plates, beakers, thermometers, and
              stopwatches  can perform the same exercise without the necessity of massive 
              investments in dedicated equipment.  ***y
