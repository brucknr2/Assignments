Abstract    :
              9351009  Malaviya  The purpose of this project is to develop a set of innovative
               experimental exercises for a laboratory course in a new  engineering physics
              program.  The program offers a valuable  strategic vehicle for students to
              pursue education and research  in areas cutting across traditional disciplinary
              lines. The lab  course is an important element in the new baccalaureate 
              engineering physics curriculum. The equipment requested herein  will be used to
              develop experiments in such areas as computer  interfacing, electromagnetic
              field behavior and imaging, laser  holography and other laser optics
              applications, fluid systems  behavior, particle interactions with fields and
              matter, etc.  The new experiments will involve state-of-the-art techniques 
              with direct relevance to real-life experiences in the high tech  R & D
              enterprise and should considerably enhance the scope and  diversity of the
              students' laboratory experience. Results of  the project will be adequately
              documented and widely  disseminated for use by other universities and colleges
              for lab  and related course work in their science and engineering  curricula.
