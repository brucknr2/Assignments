Abstract    :
              This proposal will enhance the curriculum in upper division                    
              major courses by establishing a high performance workstation                   
              laboratory and assigning projects using the workstations and                   
              specialized software packages. The specific courses and                        
              curricular enhancements are as follows. (1) a new course,                      
              systems performance modelling, which will use a variety of                     
              simulation tools to model and analyze computer systems in                      
              student projects will be developed. (2) The computer graphics                  
              course will be enhanced through inclusion of the PHIG standard                 
              and assignments utilizing a PHIG software package. (3) The                     
              numerical analysis course will be expanded to include use of a                 
              modern numerical analysis programming package for solution and                 
              graphing of representative problems and the inclusion of                       
              symbolic computations. (4) The modelling and simulation course                 
              will use sophisticated simulation tools to design more detailed                
              and graphically enhanced models. (5) The data communications                   
              course will use specially designed network simulation tools to                 
              introduce pseudo "hands-on" projects not previously possible.                  
              (6) Interactive LISP, available free from the University of                    
              Texas, will allow enhanced capabilities in the LISP, artificial                
              intelligence, and programming languages courses. (7)                           
              Undergraduates will be encouraged to use the workstations and                  
              tools provided to complete research projects proposed but not                  
              completed due to lack of resources. (8) If possible, additional                
              software such as CASE tools, circuit simulators, C++, PROLOG,                  
              and databases will be acquired and projects incorporated into                  
              the corresponding classes.
