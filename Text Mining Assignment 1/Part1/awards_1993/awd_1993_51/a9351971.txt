Abstract    :
              To generate interest in science and to create future scientists                
              in psychology, undergraduate students must be educated in an                   
              environment that facilitates their involvement in research and                 
              in the curriculum that is research based. As the environment in                
              experimental psychology changes, so too must undergraduate                     
              institutions that are educating our future psychologists.  This                
              proposal seeks to obtain funding to establish a micro-computer                 
              laboratory in human experimental psychology for undergraduate                  
              psychology majors to enhance the curriculum of four existing                   
              courses; namely, Cognitive Processes, Psychology of Learning,                  
              Psychology of Perception, and Experimental Psychology and                      
              Laboratory. The micro-computer laboratory in human experimental                
              psychology will consist of 486 computers and a software                        
              package.
