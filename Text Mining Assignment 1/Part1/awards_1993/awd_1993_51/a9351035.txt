Abstract    :
              The fast-paced world of rapid-fire TV commercials, action                      
              movies and dynamic video games does not prepare college                        
              students for sitting in a statistics lecture and absorbing the                 
              material presented on a subject that seems remote and                          
              difficult. Yet, quantitative reasoning skills are essential if                 
              these students are to be capable of filling the jobs necessary                 
              to keep America competitive in the world economy and of making                 
              crucial decisions on issues affecting societal advancement.                    
              Traditional statistics courses do not build on the interests                   
              and culture of the students to get them actively involved in                   
              the learning of the subject. This project is revising, through                 
              creative use of technology, the content, conduct and quality of                
              introductory statistics courses so as to improve the                           
              quantitative reasoning skills of all undergraduates. This is                   
              being accomplished through a series of computerized units that                 
              allow students to "discover" basic concepts of statistics while                
              engaged in hands-on activities at a computer work station. Such                
              an exploratory, discovery-based approach to learning statistics                
              requires that the course be taught with a computer laboratory.
