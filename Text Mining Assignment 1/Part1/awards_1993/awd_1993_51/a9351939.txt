Abstract    :
              This project is bringing today's technology into the                           
              mathematics classrooms at North Harris College and giving their                
              instructors the opportunity to enhance and expand instruction                  
              techniques and teaching philosophies. They are bringing                        
              technology into the classroom by: 1) placing, in each of our                   
              five classrooms, a computer that projects its images through a                 
              projection panel hooked to a cool-running projector and                        
              Personal Science Laboratory (PSL) Explorer software and                        
              hardware, 2) having available five classroom sets of TI-85                     
              graphics calculators with overhead viewers. Their primary goal                 
              is to incorporate technology into every mathematics course, not                
              just as a drill and practice, but also as an innovative tool                   
              for discovery, enrichment, deep thinking, and understanding                    
              will allow for a variety of approaches to learning.
