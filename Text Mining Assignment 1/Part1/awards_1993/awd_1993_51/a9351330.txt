Abstract    :
              9351330  Holden      A  high-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) instrument,
              with  variable temperature and multi-nuclear capabilities, is being  used
              throughout the chemistry curriculum.  Faculty are  developing an innovative
              curriculum in which the use of modern  instrumentation is crucial for
              demonstrating the inter-  relationships between the various areas of chemistry.
               The NMR  is being used by all chemistry majors extensively throughout  their
              careers at the College; significantly, this exposure  begins in the second
              semester of the freshman year.  Through a  program of slowly giving the
              students more responsibility for  NMR operation, more independence in NMR
              projects, and the  introduction of increasingly more advanced NMR theory, the 
              program is enabling chemistry students to become skilled in the  use and theory
              of modern NMR.  All chemistry majors are also  undertaking research projects,
              and many of their experiments  involve the use of the NMR.   ***
