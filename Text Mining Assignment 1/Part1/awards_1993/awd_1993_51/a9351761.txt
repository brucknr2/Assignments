Abstract    :
              9351761  Dye  Western Connecticut State University, through the acquisition  of
              new instrumentation for the isolation, culturing,  observation and manipulation
              of living cells, tissues and  organs, will increase the quality of laboratory
              instruction for  undergraduate students in formal class work (Cell Biology; 
              Developmental Biology; Methods of Cell, Tissue and Organ  Culture; and
              Immunology) and in research which is required of  all majors.  Specifically,
              students will have access to modern techniques in  cell culture, in microscopy,
              in micromanipulation of cultured  material. They will be able to use
              state-of-the-art technology  in courses and have expanded opportunities for
              individual  research.  Students will benefit by being better prepared for 
              graduate school, for professional school (medical, dental,  veterinary,
              physician's assistant), for teaching, and for work  in clinical, commercial or
              industrial laboratories.  The funding we are requesting will match funds from
              the State  of Connecticut's High Technology Program to support efforts to 
              improve undergraduate laboratory facilities.  ***
