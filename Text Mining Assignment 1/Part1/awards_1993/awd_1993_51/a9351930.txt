Abstract    :
              The Departments of Computer & Information Science and                          
              Mathematical Sciences are joining in an effort to improve the                  
              programs offered by each department and to create a new                        
              undergraduate concentration in scientific computing. The goals                 
              are to: (1) keep current a computing science curriculum; (2)                   
              educate students from other disciplines in the science of                      
              computing; and (3) strengthen the applied mathematics                          
              curriculum with the inclusion of strong scientific computing                   
              and modeling components. The laboratory will support the hands-                
              on approach of the new curricula.
