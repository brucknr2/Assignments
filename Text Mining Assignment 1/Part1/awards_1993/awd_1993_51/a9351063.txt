Abstract    :
              Automatic Identification technologies include bar codes,                       
              magnetic stripe, radio frequency identification, voice data                    
              identification, machine vision, optical character recognition,                 
              magnetic ink recognition and smart card technologies. They all                 
              have the same purpose - to rapidly and accurately capture data.                
              The current BSIE curriculum does not have any exposure to the                  
              technology of Automatic Identification that is rapidly changing                
              the practice of industrial engineering. The equipment to be                    
              acquired under this project will address this deficiency in the                
              laboratory experience of undergraduate students in the                         
              Industrial Engineering department.                                             
              The equipment to be purchased in carrying out this project will                
              represent the variety of Automatic Identification tools. In                    
              addition to learning the capabilities of each type of                          
              identification technique, students will be required to                         
              demonstrate the usefulness of these techniques within well                     
              defined projects.
