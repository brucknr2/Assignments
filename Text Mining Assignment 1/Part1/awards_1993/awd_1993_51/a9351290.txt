Abstract    :
              Funding is requested for purchase of an X-ray fluorescence                     
              analyzer (XRF), the Kevex EDX-771, to enhance our capabilities                 
              in quantification of environmental data in undergraduate                       
              courses and undergraduate research in the fields of                            
              Environmental Sciences, Geological Sciences, Biology, and                      
              Chemistry. The recent establishment of an Environmental                        
              Sciences concentration (major) at Brown builds on the expertise                
              of faculty in these natural sciences and the established                       
              policy-oriented Center for Environmental Studies. Joint use of                 
              the XRF would encourage development of interdepartmental ties                  
              while strengthening the new Environmental Science program.New                  
              environmental courses are being offered and existing courses                   
              are evolving to a stronger field-analytical orientation. Access                
              to the XRF would give students in these courses the opportunity                
              to perform chemical analyses in lab exercises simulating                       
              natural processes, to analyze natural materials, and to                        
              determine how limitations of the instrument constrain our                      
              ability to solve certain problems. A senior thesis is required                 
              of all Environmental Science and GeoScience majors and most                    
              science concentrators choose at least one semester of                          
              independent research. Many of these research projects will make                
              excellent use of an XRF analytical facility.
