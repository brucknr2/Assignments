Abstract    :
              9351029  Hoffman  This project is establishing a sound generation and analysis 
              laboratory. A group of workstations provides non-science  liberal arts majors
              in the Physics of Music course with the  means to sample and analyze sounds
              made by a non-electronic  musical instrument of their choice, followed by an
              attempt to  synthesize one or more tones made by that instrument using a 
              sophisticated computer synthesis program. The same workstations  provide
              students in the speech signal processing curriculum of  the Electrical
              Engineering department with the means to record  short utterances and analyze
              them using Mathematica. The  presence of machines with sufficient power and
              graphics display  capabilities to run Mathematica significantly enhances the 
              upper level offerings in the Physics department, allowing  capitalization on an
              innovative program in the Mathematics  department of teaching calculus by use
              of Mathematica.  ***
