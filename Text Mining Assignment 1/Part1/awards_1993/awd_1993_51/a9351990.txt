Abstract    :
              Non-intrusive fluid velocity measurement allows the velocity of                
              a fluid to be measured without disturbing the flow field.                      
              The laser Doppler velocimeter expands the capability of the                    
              existing flow measuring instrumentation at Oregon Tech. This                   
              laser-based measuring system is used by industry to measure the                
              flow of fluids in the vicinity of rotating machinery and in                    
              wind tunnels, and will be used in a similar way at Oregon Tech.                
              The laser Doppler velocimeter will be used in exercises                        
              involving, but not limited to, measurements in water and air,                  
              in wind tunnels and between rotating fan blades. The use of the                
              laser Doppler velocimeter in our courses will enrich the                       
              experience of each student. The instrumentation will be used by                
              at least 100 students per year.
