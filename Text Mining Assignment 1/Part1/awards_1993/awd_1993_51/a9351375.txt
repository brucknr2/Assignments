Abstract    :
              We are working to improve a lower division general physics                     
              (electricity and magnetism) laboratory which is taken by about                 
              260 science and engineering students each semester at San Jose                 
              State University.  We are developing experiments on magnetism                  
              by having students measure the magnetic field with Hall probes                 
              interfaced to a personal computer in a wide range of                           
              situations, and also observe the motion of charged particles in                
              electric and magnetic fields.  We are also improving and                       
              reorganizing some of our existing experiments on electricity                   
              and electrical circuits.  The new and improved experiments help                
              students develop better understanding for the abstract concepts                
              of electric and magnetic fields, reinforce classroom lectures,                 
              and provide to students hands-on experience in working with                    
              modern instrumentation.  Funds were obtained for the                           
              acquisition of 12 transverse and longitudinal Hall probes, 12                  
              personal computers, and 12 Pasco e/m apparatuses with Helmholtz                
              coils and power supplies.
