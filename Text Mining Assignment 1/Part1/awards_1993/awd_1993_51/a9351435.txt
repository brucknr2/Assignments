Abstract    :
              9351435  Moore       Interactive, computer interfaced physics and chemistry 
              laboratories are being utilized for a guided inquiry and  discovery approach in
              the teaching of general introductory  classes in physics and chemistry.  The
              laboratory centered  approach to teaching chemistry and physics is intended to 
              attract students who have avoided traditional science  instruction and to
              retain students who would otherwise be  turned off by such instruction by
              making learning  individualized, interactive, participatory, exploratory and 
              visual.  This approach has been tested and proven to improve  the learning,
              retention, and application of physics and  chemistry principles by promoting
              conceptual understanding and  relating the laboratory experience to the real
              world.  At each  workstation the student determines strategies for solving a 
              problem, chooses the initial conditions and predicts the result  of the
              experiment, and the microcomputer will perform data  collection, analysis, and
              graphing functions and/or perform  simulations of real experiments through
              interactive software  and videodisc technology.  Because this approach is more 
              efficient, students are motivated to learn more by trial and  error probing.
