Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to improve the training of                      
              undergraduates on methods of ethnoscience as practiced by                      
              archaeologists. Equipment is specifically being used in the study              
              of Late Prehistoric (A.D. 400-1500) subsistence change in the Lower            
              Mississippi Valley. Students learn to identify types of  carbonized            
              plant remains recovered from archaeological sites and to interpret             
              the significance of assemblages changing through  time during the              
              transition from a foraging to an agricultural lifeway.                         
              Undergraduates also apply the  latest analytical procedures to                 
              archaeobotanical remains from  several important sites.
