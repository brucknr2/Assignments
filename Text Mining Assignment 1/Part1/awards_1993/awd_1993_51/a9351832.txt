Abstract    :
              9351832  McClenon    Students are gaining hands-on experience on a gas 
              chromatograph-mass spectrometer, one of the most important  tools used in the
              determination of the structure of molecules.   The instrument is being
              incorporated into the organic chemistry  laboratory and into our advanced
              laboratory which serves all  upperclass majors.  We also are introducing
              freshmen chemistry  students to the technique in the second semester.  Organic 
              experiments previously performed by students have been enhanced  and more
              modern and richer experiments are being added to the  curriculum.  The
              instrument also is having a major impact on  student research by allowing more
              interesting and sophisticated  projects to be undertaken.   ***
