Abstract    :
              9351696  Van Engelen  This project will purchase a Gas Chromatograph/Mass 
              Spectrometer for the Chemistry and Environmental Science  Curricula. GC/MS
              experiments will be included in the  Intermediate and Advanced Analysis
              courses. The Organic  Chemistry Laboratory courses will include chromatographic
              and  mass spectral information early in the course so that students  will be
              proficient when they begin synthetic methods in the  second semester.
              Undergraduate researchers will use this  instrumentation to monitor the fate of
              pesticides and  decomposition products in the environment, to study the 
              leaching materials from municipal landfills, and plan synthetic  strategies and
              understand reaction mechanisms in synthetic  organic chemistry.   ***
