Abstract    :
              9351962  Smith       A pontoon barge is used for vibracoring and other
              shallow-water  sampling in an integrated program of field- and laboratory- 
              based instruction and undergraduate research in geology.  It is  used in the
              introductory-level courses of Introductory Geology,  Introductory Oceanography,
              and Environmental Science; in the  upper level courses of Sedimentology and
              Stratigraphy,  Invertebrate Paleontology, Glacial and Quaternary Geology, 
              Hydrogeology, Seminar in Environmental Geology, and Seminar on  Tropical
              Carbonate Geology; for approximately two undergraduate  research projects each
              year; and for the Lawrence Summerscience  Program, a two-week intensive program
              for high-school juniors.  Currently, most of the hands-on activities already
              incorporated  into courses are also the subjects of independent undergraduate 
              research.  The program is an example of how field and  laboratory-based
              instruction and undergraduate research can be  integrated, focused on the study
              of local Quaternary geology,  and implemented using relatively inexpensive and
              versatile  equipment.           ***
