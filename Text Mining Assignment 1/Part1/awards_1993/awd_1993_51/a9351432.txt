Abstract    :
              An introductory physics laboratory has been equipped with 6                    
              high speed, networked IBM-compatible computers and appropriate                 
              software. The project is designed to increase student interest                 
              and to render physics more intuitive.  The idea is to remove                   
              some of the abstraction from the subject, and at the same time                 
              to replace pre-Newtonian concepts with more correct ones.  In                  
              addition, the equipment is being used, with appropriate                        
              simulation software, in lecture sessions to accomplish the same                
              ends.  A third application of this equipment is to enhance the                 
              natural science CORE lectures and to provide a lab exercise                    
              that is more stimulating and motivating, in part through the                   
              use of up-to-date technology.  Present-day students do not have                
              sufficient background to pursue physics, because they have not                 
              internalized basic mathematics and have not been challenged to                 
              solve problems by thinking, but only by parroting what they                    
              have been drilled in.  This laboratory is intended to evoke                    
              understanding and insight through discovery, which has been the                
              missing element in present day pre-college education.
