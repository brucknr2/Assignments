Abstract    :
              The Department of Computer Science and Mathematics of Beaver                   
              College will substantially improve its curriculum in elementary                
              statistics by implementing a laboratory of fifteen 80486 MS-DOS                
              computers. These computers will be used to support two major                   
              changes to the statistics course. First, the format and                        
              approach of the course will change from lectures with                          
              occasional computer assignments to a lab-based course                          
              consisting of supervised computer labs coordinated with the                    
              lectures. These labs will emphasize learning statistics through                
              experimentation. Second, guest lecturers, who are experts in                   
              various applications of statistics, will each help develop a                   
              lab which uses a real data set and makes substantive use of                    
              computers. These major changes will enhance elementary                         
              statistics by 1) introducing students to a variety of                          
              applications of statistics at a depth unusual in a first                       
              course, 2) stressing learning through experimentation, 3)                      
              presenting strong role models for our many female and non-                     
              traditional students, 4) giving individual attention to                        
              students, 5) supporting the new multi-disciplinary direction of                
              the College's core curriculum, and 6) creating a unified first                 
              course. The lab will also be an integral part of upper-level                   
              computer science courses, assuring maximum utilization of the                  
              equipment.
