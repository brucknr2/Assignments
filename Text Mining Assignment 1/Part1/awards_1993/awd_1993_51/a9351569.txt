Abstract    :
              The computer equipment requested in this proposal will form the                
              core of a new undergraduate curriculum branch in Geographic                    
              Information Systems (GIS) at Eastern Washington University's                   
              Department of Geography. The new GIS laboratory will allow both                
              the development of new undergraduate courses in spatial                        
              analysis techniques and the updating of existing courses.                      
              Students will benefit from the diversity of comprehensive                      
              training.The equipment will also contribute to our                             
              undergraduate curriculum by providing the technical backcloth                  
              for studying the uses and misuses of GIS in the economic,                      
              political, scientific, and social environments in which it is                  
              applied.
