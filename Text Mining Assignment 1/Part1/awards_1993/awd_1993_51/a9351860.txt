Abstract    :
              9351860  Patek  The proposed project will enrich upper division courses offered 
              by the Microbiology Department at the University of Hawaii. The  goal of the
              proposed project is to shift the emphasis of the  courses from traditional
              microbiology toward the molecular  aspects of the discipline.  The need for the
              shift is clear; in the past 15 years, advances  in molecular technology have
              revolutionized our approaches to  the study of the biology of microorganisms
              and the immune  system. It is critical that basic training in microbiology and 
              immunology, the areas covered by his proposal, includes a well-  grounded
              exposure of the students to the tools and experimental  methodologies of
              molecular biology. Curriculum changes will  prepare the students for today's
              clinical and experimental  microbiology and immunology laboratory and for
              graduate or  medical education.  The need for curriculum improvement is
              particularly acute in  Hawaii because of our geographical isolation. The upper 
              division courses offered by this department are the only  advanced microbiology
              courses in the state and provide the only  opportunity for Hawaii residents to
              work at the cutting edge of  the discipline.  ***
