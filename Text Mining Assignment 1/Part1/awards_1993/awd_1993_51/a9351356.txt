Abstract    :
              This project supports the development of the laboratory                        
              components of manufacturing and robotics options in the General                
              Engineering Department at San Jose State University. The                       
              project will develop a modern instrumentation and robotics                     
              laboratory to complement the lecture component of two courses                  
              in these options. In addition to the equipment, the project                    
              also includes the development of nine experiments for these two                
              courses all of which are designed to demonstrate the principles                
              of control theory as applied to robotics. All laboratories will                
              be developed in partnership with industrial representatives                    
              from the local region ensuring that they are both educationally                
              and industrially relevant.                                                     
              This project continues a five-year effort to convert the                       
              pedagogical approach used in all instruction in the College                    
              from a predominantly lecture mode to a fully integrated                        
              lecture-lab approach.
