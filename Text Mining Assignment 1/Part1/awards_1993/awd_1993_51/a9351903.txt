Abstract    :
              The laboratory contains a common thread that integrates the                    
              techniques used into a cohesive unit. The Molecular Biology                    
              laboratory emphasizes isolation, detection, cloning and                        
              sequencing a fragment of the -galactosidase gene, the                         
              expression of this gene in vitro, and the analysis of the                      
              protein product by gel electrophoresis. Upon completion of the                 
              restructured labs, students have used all the basic molecular                  
              protocols and have an increased appreciation of how a series of                
              these techniques are used in an overall molecular strategy                     
              designed to study a specific gene.
