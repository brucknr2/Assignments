Abstract    :
              9351022  Mills                                The laboratory offerings for
              students in the first calculus-based  introductory physics course is being
              upgraded to include the use of  computer techniques in the experiments.  The
              students are  interfacing equipment to enter data directly into files for 
              analysis.  Spreadsheets are being used for data analysis and graph 
              preparation.  The exercises have been selected to fulfill some of  the
              functions of a traditional recitation session as well.  It is  expected that
              this will improve both the levels at which the  experiments are done and the
              students' comprehension of the  concepts.  The experience gained is providing a
              basis for planning  modernization of the other introductory laboratories.
