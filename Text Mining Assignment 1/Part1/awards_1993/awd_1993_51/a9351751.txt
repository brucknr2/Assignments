Abstract    :
              Graphical and interactive multimedia presentations are used to                 
              improve laboratory instruction. The multimedia equipment is                    
              used to develop multimedia presentations that demonstrate                      
              correct laboratory procedures and setup using diagrams,                        
              photographs, and/or video; provide instruction and                             
              demonstration of proper laboratory technique; provide examples                 
              of valid data; and present theory and phenomena in an                          
              understandable form using visualization tools. Laboratory-level                
              modules  employ a high performance dedicated platform and are                  
              available to every student in the laboratory, while laboratory-                
              station-level modules are appropriate for the computers                        
              available at each station.                                                     
              During the first year, two laboratories are targeted: the high-                
              frequency and microwave lab, and the electronics lab. Because                  
              students generally find the microwave lab particularly                         
              difficult,  multimedia presentations are used in the laboratory                
              to elucidate concepts such as standing waves. These two labs                   
              also have one laptop/notebook computer per station to present                  
              the laboratory-station-level modules. In the following year,                   
              other faculty are introduced to multimedia in the laboratories                 
              where it is most effective in improving instruction.
