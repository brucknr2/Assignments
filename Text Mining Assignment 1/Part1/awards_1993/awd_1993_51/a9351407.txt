Abstract    :
              The Mathematics Concepts and Computers project is based on a                   
              1991 pilot project, jointly funded by the National Science                     
              Foundation and the West Educational Publishing Company, in                     
              which Dowling College was an implementation site. As a result                  
              of the pilot, the number of Dowling students dropping calculus                 
              went from 52 percent in 1989-90 to only five percent in 1990-                  
              91.  The goal of the project is to improve student performance                 
              and retention at Dowling College, specifically for the over 500                
              students enrolled in entry level math courses each year. The                   
              project will incorporate computer laboratory activities into                   
              math courses using the cooperative learning model, beginning                   
              with Fundamentals of Mathematics and Pre-calculus courses.
