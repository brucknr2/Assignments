Abstract    :
              FPGAs are used in the computer engineering educational program,                
              starting at the introductory logic design course and continuing                
              in two advanced capstone computer engineering courses.                         
              Additional courses also benefit from the new FPGA laboratory.                  
              Developed are course material, FPGA technology expertise, and                  
              a plan to integrate the key computer engineering courses with                  
              FPGAs. The FPGA laboratory is used both in the sophomore logic                 
              design course and in upper level capstone courses. The                         
              significance of this approach is that integration of the                       
              courses from the sophomore level logic design course to upper                  
              level capstone design courses is effected, and major                           
              interaction among all levels of  undergraduate students is                     
              fostered.
