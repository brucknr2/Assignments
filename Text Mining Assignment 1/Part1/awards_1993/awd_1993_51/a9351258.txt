Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to make end user literature                        
              searching an integral part of student/faculty interaction in                   
              research courses in Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology. To that                
              end, the project will implement the Life Sciences Collection                   
              database on the Bates College campuswide network using Digital                 
              Equipment server technology. Students' proficiency in finding                  
              and evaluating scientific literature will be enhanced by                       
              working directly with their faculty advisors.
