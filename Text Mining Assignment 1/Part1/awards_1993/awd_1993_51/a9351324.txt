Abstract    :
              This project is designed for the improvement and expansion of                  
              several courses that focus on the role of sciences and                         
              scientific methods as applied to archaeological problems . The                 
              primary course, Introduction to Sciences in Archaeology, is                    
              required of archaeology majors, but draws the majority of its                  
              students from other non-science disciplines. The enrollments in                
              this and other courses have increased substantially over the                   
              years and the updated equipment meets the needs of the larger                  
              classes. It is also expected that the project will improve the                 
              standard of teaching, as well as expand the existing framework                 
              of the courses to include additional discussion or laboratory                  
              sections.
