Abstract    :
              9351540  Nemotko  The objective of this project is to establish inquiry-based 
              laboratories in anatomy and physiology utilizing a  technologically based
              instructional support system. The  physiological measurement instrumentation
              requested, in  conjunction with computer equipment and software already 
              available at the college, will enable students to collect and  analyze data and
              to investigate the effects of chosen variables  on muscle, pulmonary and
              cardiovascular physiology.  The  curriculum to be instituted will require
              students to select   variables, conduct literature searches, formulate
              hypotheses,  determine appropriate experimental designs, collect and analyze 
              data and report on results obtained.      ***
