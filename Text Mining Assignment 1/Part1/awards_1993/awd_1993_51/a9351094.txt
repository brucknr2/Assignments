Abstract    :
              9351094  Krause  The project will purchase a polarizing microscope with hot
              stage  and camera, a gel permeation chromatograph with appropriate  software
              and computer, and a differential scanning calorimeter with  controlled cooling,
              subambient capability, and appropriate  software.  The equipment will be used
              for a Polymer laboratory  course and will allow polymer chemistry experiments
              to also be  integrated into other upper division laboratory courses. The later 
              improvements will ensure that students who, in general, do not take  the
              Polymer Laboratory course will be exposed to this very  important part of
              modern chemistry.  These instruments will also be  used in the very successful
              summer course in Polymer Chemistry for  Chemistry Faculty in Undergraduate
              Colleges.
