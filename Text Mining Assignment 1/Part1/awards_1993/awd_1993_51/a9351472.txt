Abstract    :
              An expanded calculus program is being offered which utilizes a                 
              sequence of courses integrating lectures with computer lab                     
              experience.  The laboratory is dedicated solely to mathematics                 
              computer exploration, incorporating technological advances and                 
              a focus on concepts over calculation. The computer lab setting                 
              is used to reinforce concepts discussed in the classroom, and                  
              to enable students to discover calculus in a hands-on                          
              experience.
