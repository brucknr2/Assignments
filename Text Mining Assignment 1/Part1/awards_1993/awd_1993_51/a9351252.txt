Abstract    :
              The primary aim of this project is to provide an enhanced                      
              learning environment by using Mathematica-equipped Macintosh                   
              IIvx microcomputers to assist students in developing a deeper                  
              conceptual understanding of mathematics.                                       
              The project is based on a pilot project exploring the use of                   
              computers in calculus, modern and linear algebra, geometry,                    
              numerical analysis, modeling, finite math, and operations                      
              research courses.  While the lab will be used to enhance these                 
              other courses, and a beginning programming course, primarily                   
              through student projects and assignments and occasional in-                    
              class use of the lab, the major focus will be on in-class use                  
              of the lab in calculus and modern algebra.  The computer-                      
              equipped classroom will enhance the courses through greater use                
              of such techniques as discovery, exploration, graphing, and                    
              simulation.
