Abstract    :
              The rapidly expanding field of computational chemistry is being                
              introduced across the four year curriculum in the chemistry                    
              department.  Molecular modeling is being presented through a                   
              series of studies performed in the laboratory setting and is                   
              being related directly to results obtained from laboratory                     
              experiments.  The project focusses on four courses taken by                    
              virtually all of the chemistry and biochemistry majors:                        
              general, organic, biochemistry, and physical chemistry.                        
              Through hands-on experience in a laboratory environment,                       
              students are developing a progressively more sophisticated                     
              understanding of the power (and limitations) of molecular                      
              modeling in explaining observable chemical and physical                        
              properties of molecules.  Calculations are being performed with                
              a state of the art computational software package, the CAChe                   
              System, run on a powerful and user-friendly microcomputer,                     
              Apple's Centris 650 8MB.  In addition, the department's current                
              access to a Cray YMP-8 supercomputer is being enhanced through                 
              a Silicon Graphics workstation so that it is being used for                    
              instruction in high level quantum mechanical calculations.                     
              Concepts previously conveyed only verbally now are being                       
              presented through sophisticated interactive graphical displays;                
              displays which not only permit, but actually encourage, the                    
              manipulation of 3-dimensional structures in real-time. Further                 
              benefits include the availability of the microcomputers for                    
              data acquisition, calculations, and the production of                          
              publication-quality reports.
