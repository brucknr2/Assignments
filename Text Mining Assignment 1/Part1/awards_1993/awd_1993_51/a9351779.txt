Abstract    :
              9351779  Durojaiye  Laboratories in Experimental Biology, Microbiology, and 
              Physiology are upgraded by addition of a Controlled Environment  Chamber.  The
              equipment allows undergraduates to learn and  conduct experiments/research in a
              low temperature environment.  The equipment improves the entire Biology
              Department's  curriculum by creating an environment whereby experiments can  be
              performed that supplement regular lectures and computer  aided instructions.
              The project benefits over 1,200 students  enrolled in biological courses at
              Morris Brown College and  other students that are involved in
              cross-registration in these  science courses. The techniques learned, from
              using this  equipment, provide a firm foundation for the under-represented 
              minority groups seeking advanced training in the biological  sciences.   ***
