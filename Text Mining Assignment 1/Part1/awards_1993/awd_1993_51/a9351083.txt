Abstract    :
              Recent reorganization of our four year degree curriculum in                    
              Environmental Science as an interdisciplinary program in the                   
              College of Food and Natural Resources has injected a number of                 
              academically strong and active areas and faculty into the                      
              program. This project, therefore, is developing an analytical                  
              instrumentation program to allow the establishment of a new                    
              laboratory course. The course emphasizes biological and                        
              chemical techniques for the detection and quantitation of a                    
              variety of environmental toxins and contaminants. It is                        
              expected that the new course will also impact four adjacent                    
              colleges and enhance the training of our undergraduate students                
              in the environmental sciences.
