Abstract    :
              9351279  Pasachoff                                                       This
              project is increasing the solar-physics content of both  upper-class and
              freshman undergraduate courses by incorporating  into the courses preparation
              for, observation of, and data  reduction from solar eclipse studies at the 3
              November 1994  total solar eclipse. The equipment, comprising CCD cameras with 
              suitable filters and digitizing and associated computer  equipment, is also
              being incorporated into use with the on-  campus solar telescope in white light
              and in hydrogen-alpha.  The eclipse work is in the framework of a study of the
              cause of  coronal heating, following predictions that surface Alfven  waves
              would lead to oscillations in coronal loops with periods  of 1-10 s. Earlier
              versions of this experiment have been  carried out at two eclipses, with
              extensive student  participation at home and on site, and found indications of 
              excess power at these periods in our Fourier analysis. There  was an improved
              version on site for the 1991 total solar  eclipse, with even more extensive
              student participation, but  cloudy weather prevented observation. There is a
              complementary  research grant to perform this experiment at the 3 November 
              1994 eclipse in South America, Observations will be made with  intensified CCD
              cameras, frame grabbers, and computer  digitizing and recording, instead of the
              fiber-optics strands  and photomultipliers in the existing experimental setup. 
               Student participation with the equipment requested here  includes students in
              the Freshman Seminar and the junior/senior  solar-physics seminar as well as
              students participating in the  expedition on site. The data and equipment will
              remain useful  on campus, with the telescopes and in the courses, for years to 
              follow.  ***
