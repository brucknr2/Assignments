Abstract    :
              9351748  Miller                               A petrographic microscope with a
              CCD camera and video display,  and computerized image analysis capability, is
              being integrated  into the research-based, field-oriented curriculum for
              geology  majors.  The microscope is being used by students throughout  upper
              level courses in the major, and a revised curriculum  culminates in senior
              research projects that integrate  microscope use.  The students are being
              trained to use the  microscope in Optical Mineralogy, where it is first being
              used  as a demonstration tool.  By the end of this course, students  are
              competent in hands-on use of the microscope.  As they  become proficient with
              petrographic techniques, students are  continuing to use the microscope in
              other upper level courses,  including petrography classes.  Seniors are
              designing  petrographic research problems during their winter field  course,
              and collecting appropriate sample suites in the field.   Upon their return to
              campus, they are gathering data to answer  the problems they are posing in the
              field.  The results are  being included in their Senior Research Reports, oral 
              presentations to the department, and talks at professional  meetings.
