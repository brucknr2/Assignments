Abstract    :
              9351895  Engstrom  A chemical microscopy facility for undergraduate laboratory 
              instruction is being developed.   Polarized light microscopes  are being used
              in the early part of the undergraduate  curriculum, while existing departmental
              equipment is being used  in upper division work.  The entire curriculum
              consists of  several experiments with optical chemical microscopy, followed  by
              infrared microspectro-scopy, fluorescence microscopy, and  scanning tunneling
              microscopy.  The experiments are carried out  in general chemistry (both
              "majors" and "non-majors"), organic  chemistry, physical chemistry, and
              instrumental analysis.  Additional use of the polarized light microscopes is
              being made  in student research, by geology students, and in a chemistry  high
              school outreach program.  The program in chemical  microscopy is  providing
              students with the opportunity to  visualize matter and reactions in unique
              ways, while exposing  them to a wide variety of problems and materials relevant
              to  the marketplace.  ***
