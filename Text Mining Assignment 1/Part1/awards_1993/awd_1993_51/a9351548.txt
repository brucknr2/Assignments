Abstract    :
              This project proposes adds state-of-the-art hardware and                       
              software to teach computer-aided drafting/design, and computer-                
              aided drafting/ computer-aided manufacturing, enhancing the                    
              Drafting and Design programs at Western Iowa Tech Community                    
              College. The equipment (hardware/software combination) proposed                
              here would enable the college faculty to develop tutorials on                  
              disk accompanied by manuals for CADD/CAM instruction; to                       
              enhance efforts to train trainers...that is, to provide                        
              training for instructors at the secondary and collegiate level                 
              who in turn teach computer assisted drafting in a program of                   
              applied math and science;                                                      
              to improve access to the handicapped and other special                         
              populations who have the ability to compete successfully in                    
              drafting occupations but need special equipment in order to                    
              keep pace with other students.  To enable the Drafting and                     
              Design department to be designated as a national beta test site                
              for CADD/CAM hardware and software manufacturers, which would                  
              not only enhance learning opportunities for students, but also                 
              their employability.                                                           
              to provide enrolled undergraduate students more efficient                      
              educational opportunities that reflect the technological                       
              advances in industrial engineering technologies.
