Abstract    :
              The project will improve the undergraduate instrumentation                     
              course through the acquisition of a high field FT-NMR and allow                
              an incorporation of new experiments into existing and modified                 
              course offerings.  It will provide students with an                            
              appreciation for modern methods of NMR analysis of materials.                  
              Through the proposed course improvements, the department will                  
              be able to provide students with training in the use and                       
              operation of a powerful analytical instrument. These skills                    
              will enhance student preparation for chemical careers and                      
              graduate school.
