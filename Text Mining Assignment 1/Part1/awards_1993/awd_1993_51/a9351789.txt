Abstract    :
              The project will develop a laboratory for the modular learning                 
              of system integration and control. It takes a unique approach                  
              that can be ported to other schools. A modular laboratory will                 
              be created with mix and match high-level components which be                   
              configured in a variety of ways to represent different systems                 
              and the problems that are often encountered in real-world                      
              situations. This modular laboratory has distinct advantages                    
              over hard-wired CIM cells and low-level commercial kits.The                    
              equipment requested consists of table-top sensors, data                        
              acquisition components, indexing table, conveyors, robots, CNC                 
              mill, computers, non-contact barcode readers, data                             
              communication components, local area network, and multimedia                   
              upgrade tool kits which will supplement existing equipment to                  
              make the modular laboratory possible.This project is an                        
              important step in the department goal of continuous improvement                
              in CIM teaching. A significant number of students will benefit                 
              from the project, including IE students who are required to                    
              take the courses, and students from other departments who                      
              regularly take the courses as electives. There will also be an                 
              impact on junior high and high school students, teachers, women                
              and minority groups during the summer from workshops to be                     
              sponsored by the department.
