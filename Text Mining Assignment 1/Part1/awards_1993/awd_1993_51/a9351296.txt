Abstract    :
              The development of an Undergraduate Aerospace Flight Systems                   
              Laboratory is proposed. Except for a personal computer for                     
              input/output functions, this laboratory will consist of a                      
              FRASCA International Undergraduate Flight Simulation System.                   
              This laboratory will provide hands-on studies of subjects in                   
              aircraft flight mechanics (performance, stability and control),                
              simple stability augmentation systems (e.g., yaw damper), the                  
              dynamics of a complex aerospace system, and control systems.                   
              Because of the wide range of courses to which this facility is                 
              applicable, it will be integrated into the full ME                             
              undergraduate curriculum; from the first- or second- year                      
              course to the senior capstone design course. One of the most                   
              unique and intriguing uses of the facility will be the                         
              investigation of the flying qualities of project aircraft                      
              designed in the AAE senior design course.It should be noted                    
              that this simulator is very different from simulators used for                 
              pilot training. It is focused on being able to simulate a wide                 
              range of aircraft for the purpose of generating and collecting                 
              engineering "flight-test" data. With this capability, it                       
              becomes an engineering tool rather than a training facility. To                
              assure that the facility is used so that maximum educational                   
              benefits are achieved, a Simulator Advisory Committee has been                 
              formed (with its members from the flight simulation profession)                
              to participate in the development of the educational program.
