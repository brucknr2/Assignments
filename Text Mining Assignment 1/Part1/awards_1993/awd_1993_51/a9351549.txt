Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to establish a state-of-the-art                    
              undergraduate laboratory for rapid electronic prototype                        
              development and test. The laboratory will support courses in                   
              electronic design, packaging, reliability, troubleshooting and                 
              instrumentation. Students will also have open access to the                    
              facilities to work on individual projects and to try new ideas.                
              Laboratory equipment will include twelve electronic fabrication                
              and test benches for student use, two (GPIB and VIX) computer                  
              driven automatic test systems with TEK "Lab Windows" and Fluke                 
              "2240 GPIB Test Team" software, four PC 486 computers with                     
              CAE/CAD design, analysis, and packaging software, two high tech                
              solder stations, and a state-of-the-art surface mount                          
              technology fabrication station with a micro TV camera. The                     
              project pulls our entire electronics program together into a                   
              complete hands-on experience for the students. The laboratory                  
              presents to production oriented students everything needed to                  
              completely design, develop, build, package, qualify, and                       
              troubleshoot an electronic project, allowing students to                       
              experience the complete product development cycle.
