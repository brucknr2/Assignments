Abstract    :
              Computers (Apple IIsi) and software (both simulations such as                  
              Bioquest material and scientific writing software such as CA-                  
              Cricket, Superpaint and Microsoft Works) are used to supplement                
              hands-on laboratories with appropriate computer simulations and                
              to give students greater flexibility in graphing, analyzing and                
              presenting their laboratory results.  Student independently                    
              formulate and solve a scientific problem, critically evaluate                  
              their data and report their experiments in a journal format.                   
              The equipment is used in four courses; Cell Physiology, Animal                 
              Physiology, Genetics, and Cell and Molecular Biology.  The                     
              computers will supplement HPLC and spectroscopy  equipment                     
              obtained through an earlier ILI grant.
