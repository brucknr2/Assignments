Abstract    :
              This project will increase the scientific literacy of students                 
              by allowing them to experience the excitement and power of                     
              technological advances in chemical instrumentation and                         
              improve chemistry education on all levels by providing                         
              instruction and increasingly consistent use of the type of                     
              chemical instrumentation used routinely in the chemical                        
              profession.  A Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer                  
              System will be purchased. At each course level students will be                
              introduced to infrared (IR) spectroscopy theory at a slightly                  
              deeper level and will get experience in using the instrument.                  
              The non-majors in the introductory course will be taught the                   
              very fundamental concepts of IR spectroscopy and will do                       
              grouping studies of IR spectra they produce from thin film                     
              polymers they bring.  Students in the preparatory chemistry                    
              course, general chemistry, and organic chemistry will progress                 
              through increasingly higher levels of instrumental operation,                  
              techniques of sample preparation, including attenuated internal                
              reflectance and diffuse reflectance, spectral interpretation,                  
              structural identification, data base searches, data acquisition                
              and manipulation, and spectral storage. They will do both                      
              qualitative and quantitative analysis.
