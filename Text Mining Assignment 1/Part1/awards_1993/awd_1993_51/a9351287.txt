Abstract    :
              This project recommends a two-phase plan focusing on the                       
              development of instructional and laboratory techniques to                      
              deliver training in computer networks. The first phase was                     
              designed to identify courses for the program of study and to                   
              introduce basic networking experiments into the curricula.                     
              Trident is requesting NSF funding for the second phase to                      
              expand the laboratory capability to include experiments in most                
              of the networking techniques used in manufacturing and business                
              distributed computing. The College proposes to utilize NSF                     
              funds for the purchase of hardware and software technology that                
              enhances the hands-on approach, and expands networking                         
              competencies in the program of study. Steps for Phase II                       
              include purchasing and installing hardware and software                        
              requested in this grant application; integrating networking                    
              concepts and laboratory exercises into second year courses in                  
              the second year of the curriculum, assuring students have basic                
              networking competency; develop and implement laboratory                        
              exercises in the certificate and associate degree programs in                  
              Information Systems; and conduct an ongoing evaluation.
