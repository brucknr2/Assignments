Abstract    :
              This proposal is to equip a laboratory that will be used for                   
              programming exercises in several undergraduate courses and for                 
              senior-level projects of honors students. The laboratory is                    
              intended to be multi-purpose in supporting programming                         
              exercises for courses in real-time control, distributed                        
              programming, operating systems, parallel programming, and                      
              expert systems. The proposed robots include two mobile Nomad                   
              200 robots and a used stationary robotic arm, an IBM 7545                      
              Manufacturing System. A configuration of a PC and a Sparc                      
              station connected with TCP/IP will provide a basis for                         
              programming.The control laboratory can be used to demonstrate                  
              issues in real-time programming, distributed programming,                      
              protocol design, operating systems, interfaces, expert                         
              controls, and software engineering. We expect this laboratory                  
              to have a large effect on the way several of our undergraduate                 
              courses are taught. These courses will become much more                        
              engineering oriented and will give our undergraduate students                  
              an excellent opportunity to apply their knowledge.One product                  
              of this project will be a summary of projects that use the                     
              laboratory and the effect of the laboratory on these courses,                  
              including student interest, participation and performance on                   
              exams. We will also investigate how to integrate these robotic                 
              projects into these diverse courses and describe our                           
              experiences with the courses and the laboratory in education-                  
              oriented articles.
