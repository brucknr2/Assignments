Abstract    :
              9351254  Paselk  The project will purchase equipment to set up an advanced
              molecular  modeling workstation to enhance the undergraduate research and 
              instruction in biochemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic  chemistry, and
              organic chemistry.  This system will implement  student modeling of chemical
              processes and reactions to enhance  their understanding and chemical intuition.
              The Visualizer also  provides for the independent movement of molecules for
              docking and  observing molecular-orbital interactions. These facilities will 
              allow physical chemistry students to follow fundamental processes  in chemistry
              such as bond formation and to visualize the molecular  orbitals involved in
              spectroscopic transitions.  Students in  advanced inorganic chemistry will
              create and display the HOMO's,  LUMO's, calculated spectra, stereochemistry to
              better understand  bonding and reactivity in transition-metal complexes and
              other  systems.  ***
