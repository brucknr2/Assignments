Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Indiana University-                 
              Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) is equipping a  computer                   
              classroom to significantly expand the capability of an existing                
              classroom network and to purchase computing equipment for a                    
              classroom dedicated to mathematics instruction. It is being                    
              used by the Department of Mathematical Sciences for about 80                   
              precalculus and calculus classes per semester. This laboratory                 
              which is dedicated to mathematics classes will allow the                       
              Department to begin addressing uses of symbolic algebra and                    
              calculus software, expand its current use of graphics packages,                
              and allow elementary and secondary teaching majors to use                      
              appropriate and necessary technology as they learn and when                    
              they begin teaching. The Co-Directors are teaching classes in                  
              the classroom, and are acting as support liaisons to a working                 
              group of seven additional faculty members who will learn                       
              classroom techniques and implement and develop curricula                       
              appropriate to a technologically enhanced classroom.
