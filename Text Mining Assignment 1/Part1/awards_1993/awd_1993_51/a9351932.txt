Abstract    :
              As part of an ongoing College of Engineering Curriculum-                       
              Laboratory Revitalization Program, the Chemical & Materials                    
              Engineering Department is developing an innovative Unit                        
              Operations Lab consisting of nine new experimental stations and                
              nine new corresponding computer simulation programs and data                   
              acquisition systems. Together with a modular control lab and                   
              analytical instrumentation, this forms a new laboratory complex                
              for a flexible, modular approach to chemical processing at the                 
              systems level. It features industrial caliber equipment                        
              compatible with laboratory scale operations. The intent is to                  
              provide the undergraduate student with an education involving                  
              equipment, program simulators, data acquisition systems, and a                 
              mode of conduct representative of professional employment                      
              situations, consistent with a wide diversity of the chemical                   
              industry. The planning and implementation of this effort is                    
              being closely coordinated with an industry advisory group.This                 
              project involves the procurement of three items, i.e., heat                    
              exchanger, gas absorption, and chemical reactor units for the                  
              Unit Operations Lab. These constitute the threshold core from                  
              which  the comprehensive curriculum-laboratory structure                       
              evolves.
