Abstract    :
              Lectures and "hands-on" laboratory experiences in DNA science                  
              are provided for students in general biology, microbiology, and                
              in combined workshops for teachers and undergraduate students.                 
              Typical experiments revolve around DNA extraction, restriction                 
              enzyme analysis, separation of DNA fragments by agarose gel                    
              electrophoresis, and bacterial transformation.
