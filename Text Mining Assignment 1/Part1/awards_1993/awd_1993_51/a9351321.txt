Abstract    :
              9351321  Daniel  The project will purchase an FT Infrared instrument for use in 
              development of a new environmental sciences coop course.  The  instrument will
              be used in eight different laboratories.  More  than 600 students per year are
              expected to use the proposed  instrumentation. Implementation of an
              Environmental Science  degree will require the development of several new
              laboratory  courses as well as the restructuring of many of our chemistry 
              offerings for Engineers.  Proposed new experiments include  kinetic studies
              over catalysts, the identification of air, soil  and water pollutants, the
              determination of total carbon in  water and the characterization of industrial
              raw materials and  industrial waste, as well as traditional compound 
              characterizations.  ***
