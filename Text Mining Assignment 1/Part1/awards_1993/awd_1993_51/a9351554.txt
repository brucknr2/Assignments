Abstract    :
              9351554  Shalhoub  Modular laser instrumentation is being developed for use in 
              upper-division chemistry courses and student research.  This  approach is
              advancing students' knowledge of modern  spectroscopy and demonstrating the
              applications of lasers in  chemistry.  Since most students are intrigued by
              lasers, they  are becoming more involved in hands-on experiments.  Students 
              are using a helium-cadmium laser, monochromator, and signal  enhancing
              instruments interfaced to a computer to investigate  the spectra of molecules. 
              Light emitted from laser-excited  molecules is directed through a monochromator
              and detected with  a lock-in amplifier.  Students are building instruments from
               components to ensure that they understand the workings of what  is typically
              'blackbox' equipment.  The new experiments are  replacing outmoded or redundant
              measurements in the physical  chemistry lab with the result that the curriculum
              now has a  better balance between thermodynamics and spectroscopy.  ***
