Abstract    :
              The ultracentrifuge is used in the upper level biology                         
              curriculum for experimentation in Genetics, Cell and Molecular                 
              Biology, and Botany along with applications in undergraduate                   
              research.  This instrumentation is applied to specific                         
              laboratories in the molecular genetics of plant viruses                        
              (Genetics), of mitochondrial DNA from related strains of fungi                 
              (Cell and Molecular Biology), and the separation of catalase                   
              from glyoxysomes (Botany).  Undergraduate research is related                  
              to the molecular genetics and physiology of the                                
              corynebacterium, Clavibacter xyli subsp. cynodontis, a widely                  
              distributed endophyte of bermuda grass, Cynodon.  These                        
              instruments are also used in an NSF Young Scholars Summer                      
              Program in Forensics Science.
