Abstract    :
              The University of North Carolina in Charlotte is making the                    
              necessary changes in the calculus curriculum to take advantage                 
              of the newer curriculums as they mature and to better teach the                
              concepts of mathematics with workstations to help reinforce the                
              numerical and graphical part of mathematics.  This project is                  
              using up-to-date computing equipment that will run the software                
              that they have chosen to use in their mathematics curriculum.                  
              The College of Engineering has implemented a Sun workstation                   
              network for all of their students, and this project allows                     
              mathematics students to work with the same materials. They are                 
              running Maple and other visualization programs for many                        
              mathematics classes. This lets the department better serve the                 
              engineering, mathematics, and science students that they teach                 
              by offering them the same type of hardware that they use in                    
              their other courses.
