Abstract    :
              A  new laboratory component is proposed for the introductory                   
              computer science sequence. A computer science facility will be                 
              established that will provide for an effective "closed"                        
              laboratory component to these courses. The project will affect                 
              all the courses taught by the computer science department. New                 
              computer-servers will be added to the existing network and will                
              function as a computer science facility. Students taking                       
              computer science classes will be able to access this facility                  
              from on and off campus. Since it will be a department facility                 
              the students will be given as much access as possible. Material                
              developed by previously and currently funded NSF projects will                 
              be used as much as possible in the development of the                          
              laboratories in this project. This will provide the best                       
              laboratory software as quickly and as expensively as is                        
              possible. Every student taking computer science courses, both                  
              majors and non majors will have the opportunity to learn as                    
              much as they can and will be better prepared for transfer to                   
              other colleges and universities.
