Abstract    :
              9351053  Shaw  This project emphasizes an integrated approach to the teaching 
              of courses in digital geographic techniques to undergraduate  students. Using
              designed and coordinated laboratory exercises,  students learn the principles
              and techniques of computer-  assisted cartography, remote sensing, digital
              image analysis,  and geographic information systems. More importantly, These 
              laboratory exercises are designed to teach the interrelatedness  of different
              techniques, and to give students a good  understanding of how these techniques
              can help solve real-world  problems in geography. Also, a laboratory manual
              consisting of  related exercises and instructions will be produced as a result 
              of the project.  ***
