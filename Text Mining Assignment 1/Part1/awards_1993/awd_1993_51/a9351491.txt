Abstract    :
              The mathematics faculty of the University of Redlands is                       
              converting its calculus, differential equations, and linear                    
              algebra courses from lecture courses to laboratory courses                     
              featuring discovery-based learning in the context of real-world                
              models. The primary discovery tool for each of these courses                   
              is, or will be, the computer. In fact, we intend for each                      
              classroom in which these courses are taught to be equipped with                
              one computer for each two students. Our institutional                          
              commitment to small class sizes means we need two computer                     
              classrooms with 13 computers in each.                                          
              Redlands is now offering all of its first-year calculus courses                
              in a laboratory format; when a second computer classroom is                    
              added, the third-semester calculus course and the differential                 
              equations and linear algebra courses will be offered as                        
              laboratory courses as well.                                                    
              The Redlands project reflects its faculty's belief, shared by                  
              mathematics educators nationwide, that students learn best by                  
              actively discovering and exploring mathematical concepts. The                  
              computer allows students to visualize and explore complex                      
              models not tractable using more traditional algebraic or                       
              analytic approaches.
