Abstract    :
              9321961  Jose    This U.S.-Chile award will fund travel expenses for  eight U.S.
              scientists to organize a workshop on  commensurability in mesoscopic systems in
              conjunction  with the "Fourth Workshop in Condensed Matter Physics"  that will
              take place in Santiago, Chile, early  January, 1994. The symposium will be
              organized by Dr.  Jorge Jose, Northeastern University, Boston, and Dr. 
              Francisco Claro, Catholic University, Chile.  The  workshop will focus mainly
              on incommensurability  problems arising in the physics of artificial 
              mesoscopic structures in the presence of magnetic  fields, both in their
              classical (chaotic) as well as  quantum regimes.  These problems have been the
              focus  of recent theoretical and experimental work.    This will be the first
              meeting on this topic in the  region and the attendance of leading
              experimentalists  and theorists in the field will provide a unique  opportunity
              for the exchange of ideas and information  about important contemporary
              research in condensed  matter physics.  ***
