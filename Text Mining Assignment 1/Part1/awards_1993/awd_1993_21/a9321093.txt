Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  93321093  Lubin    This project is to
              develop, build and fly on a long-duration  balloon, to be launched from
              McMurdo, Antarctica, an experiment to  measure the cosmic microwave background
              radiation (CMBR)  anisotropy.  The instrument will make measurements on an
              angular  scale of from 1O to 10O with a sensitivity of  T/T of a few parts  per
              million.  It will use four radiometers using high mobility  electron transistor
              (HEMT) hetrodyne receivers operating in pairs  with two frequency ranges, 25-35
              GHz and 38-45 GHz.  The result  will be a medium scale map of the CMBR over
              selected areas of the  southern celestial hemisphere.  This project is an
              excellent  complement to other CMBR measurements being made at higher 
              frequencies.    This project is jointly sponsored by the Office of Polar
              Programs  and Division of Astronomical Sciences in NSF and also by NASA.  ***
