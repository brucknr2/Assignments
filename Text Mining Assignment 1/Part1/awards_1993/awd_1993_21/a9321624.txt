Abstract    :
              9321624  Gow  This award is for support for a three year project to complete
              physical properties work (analysis of visual stratigraphy, density variations,
              and c-axis fabric measurements) on the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2)
              ice core.  The objectives of this project are to: 1) complete the dating of the
              core, providing as highly accurate a depth/age scale as is possible using all
              available parameters; 2) determine the accumulation history at Summit to the
              maximum possible depth; 3) use ice crystal c-axis fabrics and related
              structural parameters to assess the extent and nature of the distortion which
              has been observed in the bottom 200-300 m of ice; 4) continue monitoring
              relaxation characteristics of the ice through repeated measurements of ice
              sample density and ultrasonic velocities; 5) carry out detailed examination of
              the basal debris layer to determine its compositional and structural
              characteristics and to delineate the origin and mechanics of incorporation of
              the debris-rich ice.  ***
