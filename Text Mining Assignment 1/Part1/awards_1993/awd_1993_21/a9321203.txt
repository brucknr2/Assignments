Abstract    :
              9321203  Orozco       This proposal for, "Studies of two-Level Atoms in Driven 
              Optical Cavities", calls for a series of experiments in Quantum  Optics.  The
              main objective is to study the way light changes its  quantum characteristics
              by the interaction with two-level atoms.  In order to control the interaction,
              it takes place inside an  optical cavity.  The addition of a second cavity
              enriches the  parameter space of the system but also serves naturally as a 
              detector for the light exiting the first cavity.  This  combination of two
              atoms-cavity units permits the study of the  response of a quantum system to
              non-classical light.  ***
