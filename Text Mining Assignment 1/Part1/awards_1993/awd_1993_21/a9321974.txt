Abstract    :
              9321974    Rankin    Description: This project supports Drs. Joanna  Rankin,
              Department of Physics, the University  of Vermont, Timothy H. Hankins of the
              New  Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, and  Joel M. Weisberg of
              Carleton College, for work  at the Giant Metre-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT)  in
              Pune, India.  They will collaborate with  Drs. G. Swarup, director of the GMRT
              and V.  Radhakrishnan, director of the Raman Research  Institute (RRI) in
              Bangalore, India. The GMRT  is a project under the auspices of the National 
              Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) in Pune.   The research will deal with
              pulsars, pulsar  emission, beaming and evolution, pulsar  microstructure, and
              pulsar timing and  polarimetry.  It will include broad  observational programs
              using the GMRT,  involving large and currently active teams from  the NCRA and
              the RRI    Scope: This project allows the three U.S.  scientists to collaborate
              with two of India's  most distinguished scientists in research on  pulsars, a
              topic of strong current interest.   They will use unique facilities including
              the  GMRT which, when completed later in 1994, will  be the largest collection
              area, fully steerable  telescope in the world, placed in a location  away from
              many man-made sources of  interference.  They will also use data  currently
              being generated using the Ooty Radio  Telescope (ORT) in India.  The project
              presents  a strong case of beneficial Indo-U.S.  collaboration in a scientific
              area which is  strong in both countries.  The project meets  the criteria of
              the Division of International  Programs.  ***
