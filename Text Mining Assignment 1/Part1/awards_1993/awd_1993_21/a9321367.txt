Abstract    :
              9321367  Nordhaus  A better understanding of the impacts of global environmental
               changes and of the strategies to control them has emerged as a  central
              concern of domestic and international economic policy  over recent years.  This
              research will continue work that will  contribute to a better understanding of
              the underlying economic  impacts and policies concerning global environmental
              problems.   The investigators have already developed an aggregate, dynamic 
              integrated climate and economic model to determine the efficient  strategies
              for controlling green house gases.  A major objective  of this project is to
              disaggregate the model and extent it to  encompass a multi-regional framework. 
              This will enable the  authors to investigate efficient green-house-gases
              control  strategies at the regional level and to analyze economic losses 
              arising from noncooperative behavior among regions.  The second  objective is
              to develop a better methodology for estimating the  impact of  global warming
              on U.S. agriculture using the results  of general circulation climate models.
