Abstract    :
              9321619  SMITH     This project will supply shipboard scientific support
              equipment for  the research vessel MAURICE EWING, operated by the
              Lamont-Doherty  Earth Observatory of Columbia University and dedicated to use
              in  support of ocean science research.         The Shipboard Scientific Support
              Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the
              proper and safe conduct  of ocean science research. This Program provides
              support for such  items as deck equipment including winch systems for the
              deployment  and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment 
              such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the
              location of research sites, communication equipment  including radio
              transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice  and scientific data
              communications and other equipment such as  motorized workboats for
              transporting scientists to and from data  retrieval sites.       The Project
              Director, James Smith is fully qualified to direct this  project having had
              considerable experience in overseeing the  acquisition and installation of
              shipboard equipment.    This project will allow the institution to modify two
              on board  cranes to give them greater reach, install sea water piping for 
              science use, acquire a GMDSS compliant weather receiver, acquire a  SOLAS
              rescue boat and davit and two GPS attitude receivers.  ***
