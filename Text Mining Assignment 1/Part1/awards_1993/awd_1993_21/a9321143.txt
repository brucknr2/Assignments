Abstract    :
              This project deals with the design and implementation of VLSI  algorithms and
              circuits for arithmetic operations on complex  numbers.  The research is
              motivated by the need for these circuits  in high-speed digital signal
              processing applications.  The goals of  the research are to:       1.  Develop
              VLSI design algorithms for the arithmetic data  path of complex number digital
              signal processors.       2.  Design and implement VLSI circuits and components
              for the  developed algorithms, with emphasis on both architecture and  circuit
              design.       3.  Study the trade-off between chip area and VLSI circuit 
              latency/throughput and to develop a design curve exhibiting their  trade-offs
              for benchmark complex number applications.       4.  Specify other data path
              components for the complex number  digital signal processor to support
              high-throughput input/output  operations and ease of programming.
