Abstract    :
              931566  Meyer    This project examines the structure of stream food webs using a
              combination of stable isotope addition and gut analysis.  Of particular
              importance is the estimation of microbial production and assessment of its
              importance in stream food webs.  This approach will be used to understand the
              effects of a resource alteration on food web properties: the effects of a large
              reduction in litter inputs.  %%%  This study will determine the utility of food
              web analysis in detecting the ecological effects of environmental alterations
              that depress ecosystem resources.  The results will be of value in forest and
              stream management, fisheries, and conservation biology.    ***
