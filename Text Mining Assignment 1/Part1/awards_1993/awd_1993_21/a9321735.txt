Abstract    :
              9321735  LEWIS   This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment
                for the research vessel CAPE HATTERAS, an NSF-owned research   vessel,
              operated by the Duke University Marine Laboratory, and   dedicated to use in
              support of ocean science research.        The Shipboard Scientific Support
              Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the
              proper and safe    conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides
              support   for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the  
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational   equipment
              such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite    receivers to pin point the
              location of research sites,    communication equipment including radio
              transceivers and    satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data   
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for
              transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.       The Project
              Director, Quentin M. Lewis is fully qualified to   direct this project having
              had considerable experience in   overseeing the acquisition and installation of
              shipboard   equipment.        This project will allow the institution to obtain
              a condition  report on the main deck crane, and to acquire an INMARSAT M and C 
              telecommunications unit and replace an inoperative GPS unit.  ***
