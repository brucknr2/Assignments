Abstract    :
              9321925  Abrams  This is a proposal for a planning trip to the Desert Ecological
              Research Unit (DERU) at Gobabeb, Namibia, to finalize a collaborative research
              effort on resource cycling efficiency, for both water and nutrients, of several
              plant communities along the Kuiseb River near Gobabeb.  The project will be
              integrated with an ongoing DERU study on ecosystem dynamics within ephemeral
              rivers and the associated Faidherbia stands.  The collaboration will allow a
              more extensive study of the soil's role in resource cycling in arid ecosystems,
              using the Namib as a relatively undisturbed model.  Data obtained during this
              trip will then be compared with existing studies in the United States.    This
              project in ecosystem dynamics fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Namibia to combine complementary talents and conduct research in areas of
              strong mutual interest and competence.  ***
