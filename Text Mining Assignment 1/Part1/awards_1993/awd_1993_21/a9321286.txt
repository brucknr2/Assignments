Abstract    :
              The focus of the proposed work is to study global  gravitational anomalies in
              Chern-Simons-Witten theories.  Topics include (1) the investigation of mapping
              class  groups; (2) a study of torsion classes; (3) algebraic  determination
              and/or detection of anomalies.  ***
