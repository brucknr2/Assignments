Abstract    :
              9321589  GILBERT  This project will utilize both morphological (from all life
              stages) and molecular (sequence data from the 12S region of the mtDNA genome)
              data to address phylogeny or the pattern of relationships among species in two
              genera of passion-vine butterflies.  Much research has already been done with
              these fascinating insects and a well substantiated phylogeny will allow testing
              of several hypotheses concerning reproductive strategies, host plant
              associations and mimicry.  %%%  These tropical butterflies represent an
              important model system for studying patterns of mimicry in predator avoidance
              and other important areas of behavioral ecology. Sound knowledge of the
              relationships among species in this group of butterflies will enhance
              understanding of mimicry, host plant associations and other features of their
              biology.  Studying such model systems can contribute to our understanding of
              insect groups and their shifts in host plant associations, thereby shedding
              light on mechanisms of host shifts such as those that occur when new insect
              pests of crops begin posing economic problems.  ***
