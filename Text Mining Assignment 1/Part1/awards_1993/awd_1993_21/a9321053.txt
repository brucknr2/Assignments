Abstract    :
              9321053  Abowd  The investigators have demonstrated that recently constructed 
              matched employer-employee data files for France and the U.S. can  be used to
              provide important new insights into the operation of  the labor market.  The
              French data has already been used to  estimate models of wage determination
              that include both  individual and firm effects.  The firm-level averages of
              these  measures are related to a number of important outcomes:  profitability,
              productivity, capital/labor ratios and survival  rates.  This research will
              extend the analysis of the French data  and develop a comparable American
              analysis using newly created  American data files.  The research is expected to
              determine  whether or not The French results, showing a strong relation 
              between compensation design variables and firm performance, also  apply to
              American manufacturing firms.  This research is  important because it will
              enhance our understanding of wage  determination and the dynamics of job
              creation and destruction at  the level of the firm.  ***
