Abstract    :
              9321258  Gillies  This award in the Research Planning Grant for Women Program is
               made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Jennifer Z. Gillies of  the Chemistry
              Department, Siena College.  Four classes of  organosulfur compounds--sulfenic
              acids, sulfines, 1,2-dithiin,  and sulfenes--will be characterized by
              rotational spectroscopy.  The planning grant will be used to test the
              feasibility of  using pulsed beam Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy as a
               new method for characterizing transient organosulfur compounds  and their van
              der Waals complexes.  The method will be useful  for structural determination
              and identification of reaction  intermediates formed in pyrolysis reactions. 
              This research  will form the basis for subsequent work by undergraduate 
              students on organosulfur compounds, including the construction  of a Stark
              modulated absorption spectrometer.  Compunds of this  type have a variety of
              uses in medicine, agriculture, and  environmental chemistry.
