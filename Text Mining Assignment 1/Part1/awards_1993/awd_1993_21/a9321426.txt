Abstract    :
              9321426  Hu  This project is on research to examine embryogenic development in 
              carrot cell suspensions.  The hypothesis to be tested is that the  transition
              from a spherical embryoid to a polar structure is  triggered by nutrient and/or
              hormone gradients caused by  resistance to mass transfer.  The techniques used
              for this  investigation include algorithms for imaging, computational  models,
              and experimental protocols developed with a previous NSF  grant.  The effects
              of potassium, nitrate, oxygen, glucose, and  auxin on embryogenesis will be
              examined.  This research could  have an impact on the controlled growth of
              somatic embryos for  large scale propagation.  ***
