Abstract    :
              9321209  Yu  An investigation of ion-mixing of superlattices as a processing
              technology for the fabrication of planar photonic integrated circuits shall be
              undertaken.  Ion-mixing has the promise of being a versatile, high yield
              fabrication approach for photonic integrated circuits requiring only a singly
              epitaxial growth step, and providing a planar structure.  We have demonstrated
              the feasibility of using ion-mixing to induce compositional disorder in
              superlattice structures made of InGaAs/InP and AlGaAs/GaAs materials at
              temperatures below 600{SYMBOL 176 \f "Symbol"}C with ions such as argon and
              oxygen and with low ion doses.    The following objectives will be pursued (1)
              investigation of the device integration using a combination of ion-mixing and
              solid phase regrowth for superlattice disordering, and photo elastic effects,
              (2) extension of the technique to exploratory optoelectronic materials such as
              InGoT/GaAs and InGoT/InAsP/InP, (3) incorporation of the techniques in the
              fabrication of tunable lasers with distributed Bragg reflector, photo detector
              with tunable filter, (4) improvement of fiber-waveguide coupling using
              ion-mixing and related techniques, (5) incoporation of superlattice disordering
              in the base of heterojunction bipolar transistor to improve performance and
              manufacturability.  ***
