Abstract    :
              9321613  Tucker       The Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at 
              the State University of New  York at Stony Brook will  establish a
              computational laboratory to support research and  graduate training in
              statistics.  This proposal focuses on  the following five applied computational
              topics:1.  Industrial Statistics: Reliability, Speech Recognition, and 
              Experimental Design.  2.  Spatially Stochastic Models for  Geofluid Dynamics:
              Flow in Porous Media.  3.  Normal Mixture  Problems in Biostatistics.  4. 
              Nonparametric Models in  Biostatistics: Semiparametric Regression, Survival 
              Statistics under Censorship, and DNA Spatial Pattern  Recognition.  5. 
              Demography: Improved Measures of  Fertility.
