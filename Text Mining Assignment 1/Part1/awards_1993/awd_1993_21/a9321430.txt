Abstract    :
              9321430  Roman  The University of Maryland, Horn Point Laboratory will continue
              the  scientific planning and management of the Coastal Ocean Processes  (CoOP)
              research initiative.  CoOP planning is being undertaken by  a group of
              scientists dedicated to organizing large scale efforts  in interdisciplinary
              coastal ocean basic research.  CoOP includes  representation from biological
              oceanography, chemical oceanography,  geological oceanography, marine
              meteorology and physical  oceanography.  Previous planning support has resulted
              in the  publication and circulation of a major planning document: "Coastal 
              Ocean Processes: A Science Prospectus".  Through a series of  workshops and the
              deliberations of a scientific planning committee,  this follow-on activity will
              start to define the actual process  studies and long-term measurements to be
              made.
