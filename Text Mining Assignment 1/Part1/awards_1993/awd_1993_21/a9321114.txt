Abstract    :
              9321114  Fung    The most important characteristic of liquid crystals is the 
              presence of orientational ordering without long-range positional  ordering. 
              The combination of variable-angle spinning (VAS) and  separated local field
              spectroscopy (SLF) will be used to study the  orientational ordering of liquid
              crystals by C-13 NMR, and to  investigate many systems important in basic
              research and industry.   The C-13 NMR will be used to investigate the dynamic
              process of the  reorientation of liquid crystals in a magnetic field. 
              Improvement  of the VAS/SLF technique will be considered, and a new method with
               rapid deceleration in VAS will be used.  Further, the possibility  of applying
              3D NMR to liquid crystal systems will be explored.  In  addition, molecular
              dynamics calculations of nematic ordering with  a new pseudo-molecule" approach
              is proposed.  ***
