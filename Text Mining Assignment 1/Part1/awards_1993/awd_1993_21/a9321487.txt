Abstract    :
              9321487  Darby   This award supports a continued sedimentological study of
              sediment  from piston and box cores from the Arctic Ocean.  The method  employs
              petrographic analysis of lithic fragments, heavy minerals,  and reflected light
              petrography and microprobe analysis of iron-  opaque grains in a comparative
              study of sediment cores and  potential source areas around the Arctic. 
              Comparison of the  petrographic and chemical data from the sediment cores and 
              potential source areas is facilitated by statistical methods to  ensure
              best-fit matches of sediment and source for determining the  origin of
              sedimentary material.   Sediment provenance determined in  this way forms the
              basis of inferences about transport pathways and  the petrographic
              characteristics are used to infer transport  mechanisms.    This project will
              use existing material as well as cores to be  collected during the Arctic Ocean
              Section cruise in the summer of  1994.  The goals are to 1) determine the
              source of ice-rafted  sediment for the latest major glacial and deglacial
              events and to  infer Arctic Ocean surface circulation patterns during the last 
              18,000 years; 2) infer the drift patterns for older ice-rafting  events; 3)
              assess the potential distribution of contaminated  sediment from Russian rivers
              which are redistributed by sea-ice  rafting; and 4) expand the database from
              which sediment provenance  for the Arctic Ocean is derived.  This work is basic
              information  about sedimentation in the Arctic Ocean and represents a 
              significant investment in geologic information that will be  valuable for other
              projects focusing on past climates and recent  geologic processes active in the
              Arctic.  ***
