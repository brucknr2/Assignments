Abstract    :
              9321232  Wang  The technique of ion implantation has been utilized in the
              semiconductor industry.  Thin film ceramic superconductors are expected to be
              integrated with semiconductors for future microelectronics applications.  The
              prospect of having ion implantation for superconductor thin film processing
              would be extremely desirable, since it is compatible with present
              microelectronics technology.  To date the overall effort on the utilization of
              ion implantation for superconductivity processing is quite limited.  ***
