Abstract    :
              9321549  Gulliver  Lotic ecosystems are composed of an array of biological
              communities known o be heavily impacted by sediment loads originating from
              mining, forestry, and agriculture.  To date, few controlled experiments have
              been conducted in which whole ecosystems are manipulated for the purpose of
              examining variable sediment load effects on ecosystem functioning.  %%%  Using
              eight constructed channels, a collaborative investigation will study different
              sediment load impacts on fish populations, primary producers,, benthic
              invertebrates, and microorganisms.  This part of the project will evaluate
              models of sediment effects on light regimes, free stream turbulence and
              nutrient fluxes, as well as models of primary producer response to these
              factors.  A primary objective is to improve the accuracy of productivity
              measurements by using modified enclosures that simulate channel hydrodynamic
              characteristics.  In addition, photosynthesis, stream productivity and benthic
              respiration will be measured in each channel using the following techniques,
              respectively:  oxygen and 14C measurements; light/dark bottles and diel
              surveys; benthic respirometer and microelectrodes.  %%%  Evaluation of sediment
              impacts on the above environmental factors and more accurate measurements of
              productivity should elucidate the lotic criteria which can protect stream
              communities from deleterious land management practices.
