Abstract    :
              9321187  Altmann    The detrimental demographic consequences of inbreeding have
              been well documented for many kinds of animals, including a number of mammalian
              species.  Although these deficits have been associated particularly with early
              stages of life, such as mortality during the neonatal period and reduced litter
              size at birth, proximal mechanisms producing these outcomes remain largely
              unexplored.  Furthermore, most previous studies have associated the detrimental
              effects of inbreeding with some deficit in the offspring, and have not
              considered the possibility that inadequate parental care may be the cause.   
              The doctoral-dissertation research of Ms. Susan W. Margulis will investigate
              behavioral aspects of reproductive success, and those factors that may manifest
              themselves later in an individual's life, such as behavioral adequacy of
              parenting by inbred parents, and will distinguish between parental and
              offspring effects.  The effects of inbreeding on mating behavior, parental
              behavior, and reproductive success will be studied in two captive populations
              of deermouse, one derived from an isolated, island population, and one from a
              widespread, mainland population.  Differential reproductive success and
              adequacy of parental behavior will be evaluated in pairs in which both parents
              are inbred, neither is inbred, only the mother is inbred, and only the father
              is inbred.    The information gained from this study may be incorporated into
              management plans for captive populations and endangered species.
