Abstract    :
              This award is for support to continue measurements of deuterium on samples from
              the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core. The values of deuterium
              measured on the GISP2 ice core samples will be used to reconstruct and
              interpret the temperature history recorded in the core.  Deuterium excess
              values will also be calculated in order to determine the climate conditions at
              the oceanic moisture source.  This work will be coordinated with the group from
              the University of Washington that is measuring oxygen isotope ratios on the ice
              core.  Work to date suggests that records of pressure (North Atlantic
              Oscillation) and temperature (Jakobshave-Oslo seesaw) oscillations are recorded
              in the deuterium and deuterium excess values.  Values of deuterium excess
              during the last glacial period show sharp changes at the times of some, but not
              all, of the massive fluxes of icebergs into the North Atlantic ocean (Heinrich
              Events).  Major questions to be addressed include the nature of rapid climate
              changes seen in many of the climate proxies measured in the core, the existence
              of modes of climate as reflected by preferred states of the climate proxies,
              and the importance for the climate record of differential thinning and
              thickening of layers, as well as possible folding and faulting of the near
              basal ice.
