Abstract    :
              9321788 Soltis          Species diversity in the plant genus    Gilia    of the
              phlox family has provided a rich resource for numerous biosystematic studies of
              speciation patterns and processes.  The taxa were used as model systems for
              many of Verne Grant's ideas about modes and rates of plant evolution in his
              classic text, Plant Speciation.  However, no explicit phylogenetic analysis of
              the ca. 70 species of    Gilia    has been made; consequently, the detailed
              affinities of individual species are not well known, and much remains
              speculative about the pattern of diversification and species divergence in this
              group.  Under the direction of faculty adviser Dr. Douglas Soltis, graduate
              student Leigh Johnson is conducting field work and laboratory analyses of two
              major species groups of    Gilia   , in order to amass new chloroplast and
              nuclear DNA evidence on species relationships.  In addition, numerous
              population samples will be analyzed for protein variability to assay genetic
              polymorphisms and variability.          A DNA based phylogeny of    Gilia   
              will facilitiate the study of diversification of floral form and of breeding
              systems in the genus by clarifying the direction of change and identifying
              intermediate steps in evolution.
