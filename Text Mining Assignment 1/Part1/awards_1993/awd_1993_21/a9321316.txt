Abstract    :
              9321316  Johnson   This study examines the history of the avian genus Piranga
              (tanagers) and its relatives using a variety of kinds of data including plumage
              patterns, protein electrophoresis, mitochondrial DNA, and morphology.  These
              data will allow generation of phylogenetic (genealogical) hypotheses for this
              group, which will be used as a backdrop for study of plumage dimorphism (males
              and females have different plumage colors and patterns), seasonal migration,
              and vocalizations.  %%%   The study will demonstrate whether correlations exist
              between plumage dimorphism and various life history traits, and this
              information will be used to test hypotheses about the significance of plumage
              dimorphism in birds.
