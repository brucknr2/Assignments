Abstract    :
              The design of a VLSI system involves multiple design  representations; and the
              design must go through several iterations  aimed at meeting many performance
              and cost constraints.   Verification that the design meets constraints is
              necessary.  This  research is developing rigorous verification methods that
              span  multiple design representations, accommodate design revisions, and 
              provide incisive partial verification methods (e.g. verification  focussed on
              the "corners" of the behavioral space) that fit within  designers' time
              budgets.  These ideas are being validated by  verifying the real asynchronous
              designs.
