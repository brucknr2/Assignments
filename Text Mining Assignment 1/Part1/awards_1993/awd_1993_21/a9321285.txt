Abstract    :
              9321285  Wolf       Wolf will continue his research on Lie groups, harmonic 
              analysis and representation theory, with applications to complex  analysis,
              riemannian geometry, numerical analysis and control  theory.  He will continue
              his work on infinite dimensional Lie  groups that are direct limits of finite
              dimensional groups, and  will investigate questions in control theory that are
              essentially  questions of representation theory.       The theory of Lie
              groups, named in honor of the Norwegian  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one
              of the major themes in  twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical
              vehicle for  exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the 
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact  upon mathematics
              itself, particularly in analysis and number  theory, and upon theoretical
              physics, especially quantum  mechanics and elementary particle physics.  ***
