Abstract    :
                9321535  COLLIER    Differences in nitrogen nutrition might affect the
              distribution of  phyoplankters because each nitrogen source has different
              patterns  of availability. Ammonium, which is the preferred nitrogen source  of
              most phytoplankton, is often not available in sufficient  quantities to support
              phytoplankton growth. Therefore urea and  nitrate are important nitrogen
              sources for the phytoplankton.  Because urea like ammonium is produced within
              the plankton, while  nitrate is supplied from deeper water, the relative
              availability of  the various nitrogen sources changes both in space and in
              time.    Marine cyanobacteria currently in culture are able to grow with 
              ammonium or nitrate as sole nitrogen source, but only about half of  them are
              able to utilize urea. This suggest that urea may affect  the growth rate and
              distribution of marine cyanobacteria. This  project, will develop molecular
              probes to cyanobacterial ureases  which will then be used in field studies to
              examine the  relationships between cyanobacterial urease utilization and basic 
              oceanographic parameter. Molecular probes will be used because it  is unlikely
              that any other techniques can provide the sensitivity  and resolution required
              to understand these relationships.  ***
