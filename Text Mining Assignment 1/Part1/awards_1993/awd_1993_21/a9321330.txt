Abstract    :
              9321330  Eloranta         The objective of this research is the remote
              measurement of  cloud particles.  The University of Wisconsin High  Spectral
              Resolution Lidar (HSRL) will be used to measure the  extinction profile and the
              dependence of lidar signal strength on  the angular field of view of the
              receiver.  As the field of view is  increased, multiply scattered photons
              provide a larger fraction of  the lidar return.  The variation of multiple
              scattering with field  of view is strongly dependent on particle size. 
              Algorithms will be  developed to infer particle size from this dependence. 
              Results  will be tested by comparison with airborne insitu measurements.
