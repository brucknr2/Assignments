Abstract    :
              9321721  Buddemeier    The recent anomalous precipitation pattern and resultant
              flooding  in the Midwestern US presents  extraordinary opportunities to 
              investigate the dynamics of coupled surface-water/groundwater  systems. 
              Coincidentally, digital high resolution radar  precipitation data serves
              powerful new techniques to the use of an  extreme event as a hydrologic system
              probe.  We propose a prompt,  intensive reconstruction and interpretation of
              rainfall, surface  water responses, aquifer recharge and groundwater
              equilibration in  an aquifer that has been intensively studied and well
              characterized  under "normal" conditions.  The proposed research has three
              primary  objectives.  The first is to explore the novel use of weather radar 
              rainfall estimates as a means of constructing precipitation  estimates with
              unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, and  to compare the values thus
              derived with conventional weather  station estimates.  The second objective is
              to extend high-  resolution hydrology to surface and groundwater by developing 
              detailed recharge and runoff estimates.  The third objective is to  explore the
              feasibility of combining routine and special  groundwater level measurements
              with the refined recharge estimates  in order to determine aquifer
              characteristics by observing the  groundwater equilibration following what may
              be considered a  spatially-variable aquifer-scale slug test.  ***
