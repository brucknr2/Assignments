Abstract    :
              9321454  Welker  The focus of this research is the use of transition-metal 
              substituted 1,3-diene complexes as substrates in cycloaddition  reactions,
              especially in Diels-Alder reactions.  Transition-metal substitution will be
              utilized to enhance the  reactivity of dienes as well as enhance the regio- and
               stereoselectivity of subsequent cycloaddition reactions of  these dienes,
              especially in control of exo-endo ratios of  Diels-Alder products. It will be
              demonstrated how simple  changes in the metal's coordination sphere can
              profoundly alter  the stereochemical outcome of subsequent Diels-Alder
              reactions  thus providing some practical solutions to long standing  reactivity
              problems associated with the use of Z- and  1,1-disubstituted dienes in this
              reaction. Cleavage reactions  involving the metal substituted cycloadducts will
              show how  these metal substituted dienes can serve as synthons for  several
              dienes which normally have low reactivity in  Diels-Alder reactions.
              Transition-metal substituted chiral  dienes will be investigated as useful
              reagents for asymmetric  Diels-Alder reactions involving acyclic dienes which
              are  invariably poorer substrates in catalytic asymmetric  Diels-Alder
              reactions than cyclic dienes.  %%%  With this award the Synthetic Organic
              Program is supporting the  research of Dr. Mark E. Welker of the Department of
              Chemistry  at Wake Forest University. Professor Welker will focus his work  in
              the area of development of synthetic methodology using  transition-metal
              substituted diene complexes in cycloaddition  reactions, one of the most
              important methods for constructing  complex ring systems.  ***
