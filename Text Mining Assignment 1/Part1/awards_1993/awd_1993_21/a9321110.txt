Abstract    :
                Proposal:  9321110          ABSTRACT         Date:  6/1/94        PI:  M.D.
              Wand                         Institution: Displaytech, Inc.    This Small
              Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project deals with the design,
              synthesis  and characterization of temperature insensitive ferroelectric liquid
              crystals (FLC) which are  easily aligned, have a broad operating chiral smectic
              A range and show a large electroclinic  effect. Such FLCs show a linear
              electro-optic effect which permits gray modulation without  partial domain
              switching. Specifically, the Phase II research will synthesize 80-120 new FLCs,
               test their ability to induce temperature insensitivity of proprietary
              Displaytech smectic B dopants,  and test and optimize for nematic phase
              induction N*-inducing Displaytech dopants. Achieving  these objectives will
              permit the formulation of the best analog liquid crystal mixture which will  be
              evaluated in two devices, a linear array modulator for analog beam steering
              applications and  a single element continuous grayscale modulator.    High
              speed analog intensity modulators, based on temperature insensitive FLCs
              showing a large  electroclinic effect will find applications in flat panel
              displays, analog beam deflectors,  continuously tunable birefringence filters
              useful in imaging spectrometers, and neural networks.  These technologies are
              of high current interest and strategic importance.
