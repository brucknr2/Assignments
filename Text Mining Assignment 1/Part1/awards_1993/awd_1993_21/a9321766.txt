Abstract    :
                   The proposed research covers a variety of topics in  relativistic nuclear
              physics.  QCD sum rules will be applied  to meson exchange models of nuclear
              matter.  The Nambu-Jona-  Lasinio model will be used to study nucleon
              confinement and  nucleon correlators in nuclear matter.  Nucleon structure 
              will also be explored in a quark-diquark model.  ***
