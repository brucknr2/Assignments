              University of Maine  Title: Long Records of Paleoclimate from Florida    Recent
              research on a continuous 50,000-year sediment record from  eastern North
              America has revealed a striking correlation between  Heinrich events (large
              surges in flow of ice streams feeding from  the Laurentide ice sheet into the
              North Atlantic) and major changes  in vegetation in peninsular Florida.  These
              events are expressed at  Lake Tulane, Florida, as abrupt shifts between
              pine-dominated and  oak-dominated communities, which likely correspond with
              times of  moist climate alternating with periods of extreme drought.   Those 
              results suggest that  the Heinrich events involved important  changes in
              ocean-atmosphere circulation, and thus forcing other  than internal dynamics of
              the ice sheet.  This award supports a  research project designed with the
              following objectives: (1) To  establish a higher-resolution AMS-radiocarbon
              chronology for the  sediments of Lake Tulane.  The record will verify whether
              the  vegetational shifts in Florida are indeed synchronous with Heinrich 
              events; (2) To reconstruct the history of lake-level fluctuations  in Lake
              Tulane; (3) To extend the regional and temporal records of  vegetation and
              climate for peninsular Florida by studying the  pollen stratigraphy of new long
              cores (already collected) from  several in-filled sinkholes.  These sediments
              appear likely to span  much more than the 50,000 years covered by the Lake
              Tulane record,  and thus have excellent potential to produce the first record
              of  changes in vegetation and climate spanning the last complete 
              glacial/interglacial cycle in eastern North America.
