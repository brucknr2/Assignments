Abstract    :
              9321910  Biscaye  This award is for support for a one year project to apply a
              variety of natural tracer techniques to the varying concentrations of dust in
              the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core, during the period from
              the Older Dryas to the Pre-Boreal, and to the varying dust concentrations
              deposited during the stadials and interstadials which correspond to Heinrich
              Events H4 and H3.  Several natural tracers including mineralogical analysis,
              isotopic analysis of aluminosilicates (Strontium, and Neodymium) and of soluble
              minerals such as calcite and gypsum (Oxygen, Sulfur and Carbon), and pollen 
              analysis are proposed to help determine the origins of this material. 
              Preliminary work on ice core samples from the last glacial maximum (LGM) have
              demonstrated significant mineralogical variation, indicating a southward shift
              in dust source area between samples from a lower-dust, interstadial period and
              a higher-dust, stadial period about 700 years apart.  With this information,
              net airmass transport pathways can be used to aid in the modeling of
              atmospheric paleocirculation patterns.  ***
