Abstract    :
              9321533  Slattery  The proposed research program will utilize analytical
              chemistry  techniques to evaluate the importance of secondary metabolites  and
              steroids in reproduction of the soft corals Lobophytum spp.,  Sarcophyton spp.,
              Sinularia spp., and Stereonephthya spp. from  Guam.  It is a continuation of an
              ongoing project which has  identified and examined the importance of secondary
              metabolites,  organic extracts, and morphological defenses in soft coral 
              predator deterrence.  This research will expand upon the  aforementioned
              program to extract, isolate, and determine the  structures of new secondary
              metabolites in adult colonies and  their eggs.  Temporal changes in
              concentrations of these  compounds will be correlated with reproductive indices
              to assess  the role of the compounds in maturation and spawning.  Standard 
              bioassays will be conducted to guide isolation natural products  in egg
              release, sperm chemotaxis, and feeding deterrence.  Novel  compounds identified
              in this project will expand upon a growing  database of metabolites that can be
              used as chemotaxonomic  markers and will be incorporated into existing
              pharmacological  programs.  Furthermore, this project will contribute
              significant  insights into the reproductive biology and chemical ecology of 
              the common soft corals on the shallow reefs surrounding Guam.  ***
