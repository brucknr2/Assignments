Abstract    :
              9321341  Vohs    The objectives of this project are to provide a comprehensive
              description of the surface-chemical phenomena involved in the growth of
              epitaxial layers of zinc selenide (ZnSe) on the (100) surface of gallium
              arsenide (GaAs) and to develop relationships between surface chemistry, film
              structure, and interfacial properties.  The influence of surface reconstruction
              of a GaAs(100) substrate on the growth of epitaxial ZnSe films using
              metalorganic molecular-beam epitaxy (MOMBE) is studied.  The adsorption and
              reaction of dimethylzinc, diethylzinc, and diethylselenium on the arsenic-rich
              c(4x4) and c(2x8) reconstructions and the nearly stoichiometric (1x6)
              reconstruction of GaAs(100) are investigated using temperature-programmed
              desorption and high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS). 
              These results are compared with those from previous studies on the gallium-rich
              (4x1) reconstruction.  The morphology and surface structure of ZnSe films are
              characterized using atomic force microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy
              as functions of GaAs(100)  substrate reconstruction and processing conditions
              (temperature, pressure, etc.).  Structure and electronic properties of
              ZnSe/GaAs interfaces are probed using HREELS and nonlinear optical
              spectroscopies.    The specific couple studied in this project is used in
              diodes, LEDs, lasers, and other optoelectronic devices.  Improved processing
              techniques should lead to expanded uses.  Additionally, much of this effort may
              be generalizable to other II-VI / III-V heterojunctions.
