Abstract    :
              9321993  Esch  This award provides funds to continue a success REU SITE for
              another three years.   Undergraduate students, with the primary emphasis on
              women and minorities, will be given  the opportunity of an 11-week research
              experience (Summer Undergraduate Research  Experience) with faculty members in
              the Department of Biology of Wake Forest University.   The research interests
              of the students will be matched with those of participating faculty.  In 
              conjunction with the research experience, students will be exposed to a range
              of other  activities, including two overnight field trips and a weekly seminar
              program given by  departmental faculty members.  Special time will be set aside
              for instruction in elementary  biostatistics, experimental design, slide
              preparation, review of primary literature sources, etc.   The summer's research
              activities will culminate with an afternoon-long colloquium, at which  time the
              students will present the results of their work to faculty and other summer 
              participants.  Students will be quartered in one of the University's
              residential houses in order  to facilitate maximum student-student interaction.
               Previous experience with this research  program format has shown it to be
              successful.  ***
