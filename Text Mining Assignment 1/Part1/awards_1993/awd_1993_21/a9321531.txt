Abstract    :
              9321531  Eisenberger    Princeton University and the University of California at
              Santa  Barbara, jointly will hold a series of six workshops in which 
              participants from universities, government and industry look  strategically at
              selected areas of technological and societal  importance.  The goals of these
              meetings will be, first, to  identify important areas in which progress can be
              made, then to  identify fundamental scientific problems that need to be solved 
              in order to make progress in those areas, and finally to identify  resources
              that will be needed to carry out relevant research.  In  short, the workshops
              will identify explicitly those places where  fundamental research at
              universities can make significant impacts  on critical technologies.  They will
              also provide guidance both  for academic scientists and engineers and for the
              National  Science Foundation.  ***
