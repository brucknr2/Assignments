Abstract    :
              9321714  MUSCATINE  This Faculty Research Fellowship in Marine Biotechnology
              will  permit  the PI, Dr. Leonard Muscatine, to spend a total of 9 months  (6
              month sabbatical and 3 month fellowship) in the laboratory of  Dr. Paul Levine
              to investigate the molecular biology of thermal  stress in the symbiotic
              anemone, Aiptasia pulchella. Ongoing  research in Dr. Muscatine's laboratory is
              focussed, in part, on the  mechanism by which thermal stress destabilizes the
              symbiosis of  cnidarians and symbiotic dinoflagellates. The PI will learn
              protein  and nucleic acid techniques while investigating the nature of the 
              proteins synthesized as a consequence of both low and high  temperature stress.
              This fellowship will provide Dr. Muscatine, a  world renowned expert in marine
              symbioses, the opportunity to  acquire the rapidly developing molecular biology
              tools he needs to  keep his research at the cutting edge.  ***
