Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-21879    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V KNORR, a 279 foot vessel owned by the Navy, the R/V
              OCEANUS, a 177 foot vessel owned by NSF, or the R/V ATLANTIS II, a 210 foot
              vessel owned by WHOI.  All of these vessels are operated by the Institution in
              support of oceanographic research, and NSF is the primary user of each ship. 
              Instrumentation requested includes computer hardware, a 3-D GPS system, an FSI
              CTD system, CTD data storage upgrades, Niskin bottles, auxiliary sensors for
              the CTD, a calibration temperature bath controller, a water filtration system,
              a multi-sensor core logger, a -70 degree freezer, a grab sampler, a hydro winch
              slip ring assembly, a portable sterilizer.  The instrumentation requested is
              required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the ships during 1994/95 and
              will enhance the scientific capability of the vessels in the future.
