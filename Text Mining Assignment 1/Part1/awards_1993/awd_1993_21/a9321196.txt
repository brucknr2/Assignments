Abstract    :
              9321196  Doherty  Univ. of Calif. - Irvine  Dr. Nancy M. Doherty, Chemistry
              Department, University of California Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to develop the synthetic
              chemistry needed to prepare transition-metal-containing polymers. Polymers
              containing an early transition metals linked through nitrido bridges will be
              prepared by the ring opening of cyclic early transition metal nitride
              complexes. Analogous polymers containing later transition metals will be
              constructed using  complexes containing N-M-N linkages as building blocks. 
              Inorganic polymers are an important class of materials possessing a range of
              properties and with a variety of potential as well as actual applications.
              However, in spite of a wealth of polymeric systems which can be imagined, this
              field is very underdeveloped. The focus of this project is the development of
              methods to prepare polymers which incorporate transition metals into a polymer
              chain. These materials promise to have a broad range of mechanical, electrical,
              optical, and magnetic properties.
