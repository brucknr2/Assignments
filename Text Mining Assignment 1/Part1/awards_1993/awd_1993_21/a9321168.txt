Abstract    :
              9321168  Sezgin    Description:  this project supports  participation by U.S.
              scientists in the "VIth  Regional Conference on Mathematical Physics",  planned
              for February 5th through 11th, 1994, in  Islamabad, Pakistan.  The conference
              will  highlight the latest developments in the field  of high energy physics
              and cosmology.  The  emphasis will be on the discussion of particle 
              phenomenology, QCD light cone methods, neutrino  physics and weak interactions.
               In the more  mathematical section, the conference will focus  on formal
              aspects of field theory:  superstrings, conformal field theory, finite 
              temperature field theory and its implications.   A third session will be
              devoted to general  relativity and cosmology.      Scope:  This meeting is
              expected to be attended  by scientists and young physicists from South  Asia,
              and Central Asia, as well as by speakers  from the U.S., Canada, Europe,
              including from  Turkey.  The aim of the conference is to  promote research in
              fundamental physics and  mathematical physics in the countries of South  and
              Central Asia, and to create linkages  between young scientists in these regions
              and  U.S. scientists.  This fits well with the  objectives of the Division of
              International  Programs.  ***
