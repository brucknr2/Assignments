Abstract    :
              9321293  COLEY    A widely accepted explanation for the diversity of tropical
              forest trees is that there is high mortality of seeds and seedlings near
              conspecific parents.  However, the mechanisms of this effect have received
              little study: do plant enemies accumulate in the vicinity of conspecific adult
              trees?  This project examines where the herbivores attacking seeds and
              seedlings come from, how distance from adult trees affects rates of herbivory
              and pathogen infection, and whether herbivory facilitates pathogen infection. 
              %%%  This study will provide important data on the role of herbivores and
              pathogens in maintaining tropical forest tree diversity.  The results will be
              of value to tropical forestry, forest management, and tropical forest
              conservation.  ***
