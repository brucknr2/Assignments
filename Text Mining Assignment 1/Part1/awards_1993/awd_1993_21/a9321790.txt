Abstract    :
              9321790  Antonovics   This project is an investigation of the mechanisms
              governing population dynamics in Cardamine pennsylvanica, a weedy plant.  In an
              earlier study, experimental populations of these plants displayed complex
              numerical dynamics over fifteen generations, with populations cycling from low
              to high density in three to four generations.  Although simple models of
              density-dependent population growth predict that the oscillatory dynamics are
              possible, these models predicted stable (non-cyclic) dynamics when applied to
              our experimental populations.  This project will investigate what factors
              responsible for the discrepancy between the model predictions and the observed
              dynamics.  From this, the investigators extrapolate to when similar mechanisms
              might drive complex dynamics in natural populations.   The significance of
              complex dynamics in nature is twofold.  First, if these dynamics are the
              product of deterministic population regulation (as opposed to stochastic
              fluctuations in resource availability), then attempts to interpret the
              complexity of nature should focus on understanding the feedback mechanisms that
              drive these processes.  Second, populations that are highly variable in size
              are prone to extinction due to demographic stochasticity, and may be unable to
              adapt to a changing environment due to increased probability of random genetic
              change.  Thus, an understanding of population dynamics is crucial to
              interpreting basic ecological studies, as well as to environmental management.
