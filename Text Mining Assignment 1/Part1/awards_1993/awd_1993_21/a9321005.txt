Abstract    :
              This project is being supported under Phase II of the Small  Business Innovation
              Research (SBIR) Program.  It will support the  development of a reliable and
              effective software system for the  design and analysis of composite
              multilayered shells.  The system  should be capable of modeling both linear and
              nonlinear behavior  in three dimensions, assessing the quality of the solution,
              and  providing feedback so that the quality of the solution can be  improved. 
              Its hierarchical structure should allow the selection  of models of increasing
              complexity in an adaptive manner, so that  the goals of computation are
              satisfied within the required  accuracy and with minimal effort.  The
              investigation will be  focused on hierarchical sequences of models for
              laminated shells  and the issues of implementation of these models into the 
              structure of the p-version of the finite element method.  In the  Phase I
              effort, the scope was limited to the bending of laminated  plates and
              addressing their extension to shells.  Phase II will  involve utilizing the
              results of Phase I to assess the problems  associated with bending/membrane
              coupling and curvature, and to  extend those concepts to the nonlinear
              (small-strain large-  deformation) solution methods for laminated plates and
              shells.
