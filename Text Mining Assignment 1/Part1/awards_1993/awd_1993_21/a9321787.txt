Abstract    :
              9321787                   One focus of this research is the preparation of high
              carbon   content, dense, refractory materials via thermal curing of   three
              dimensional oligomeric matrices derived from   polymerization of
              tetraethynylmethane.  A second focus is the   assembly of periodic, covalently
              linked two and three   dimensional carbon networks with high strength to weight
              ratio   which could be used as "organic zeolites."  %%%  With this award, the
              Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. Ken S. Feldman of
              the Department of   Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University.  Professor
              Feldman   will focus his work on the synthesis of organic solid materials  
              whose desirable bulk properties can be related to the   composition of the
              component molecules.  ***
