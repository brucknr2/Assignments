Abstract    :
              9321507  Smeeding    The Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) is an international
              consortium with a membership of 20 nations located in Europe, the Middle East,
              North America, and Australia.  These countries, via their respective funding
              organizations, cooperatively support a research center in Luxembourg that
              standardizes and makes available household-based microdata on incomes for
              representative samples of member nations' populations.  These data are used by
              over 260 researchers worldwide to analyze economic and social policy structure
              and its effect on such topics as income structure, poverty and income
              inequality and wage and earnings differences.  Researchers can access the data
              on-site, or via a computerized telecommunications network.    Funds provided by
              the National Science Foundation constitute United States participation in the
              consortium.  The full cooperation of all member nations is required in order to
              guarantee feasibility of data retrieval, maintenance of high standards of data
              quality, and gradual relaxation of methodological constraints on certain types
              of data analysis.  National Science Foundation funds not only represent U.S.
              cooperation in the enterprise, they also assure U.S. involvement in all
              important developmental decisions as well as helping to offset the cost of
              database maintenance and update.  ***
