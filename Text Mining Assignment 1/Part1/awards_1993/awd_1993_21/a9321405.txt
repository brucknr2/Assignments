Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to extend predictive frost heave  models to full
              3-D forms in an effort to better understand the  processes involved in
              development of patterned ground, such as  earth hummocks, that occurs in
              periglacial environments.  Of the 19  mechanisms thought to be important,
              either singly or in  combination, for formation of patterned ground, only two
              have been  incorporated into mathematical models.  The objectives of this work 
              are: 1) to use published laboratory frost-heave data to test a  simplified form
              of the 1-D secondary frost-heave model of O Neill  and Miller which can be
              generalized to 3-D; 2) to ascertain the  ability of a new differential
              frost-heave model based on this  simplified form of the O Neill and Miller
              model to describe earth  hummocks whose relevant properties have been
              characterized; 3) to  refine this differential frost-heave model based on the
              laboratory  and field observations; and 4) to explore the applicability of this
               model to describe features of other forms of patterned ground.  In  addition
              to improving models of periglacial processes, this work  will benefit
              researchers correlating ancient geomorphic features  with past climate as well
              as engineers developing construction  projects in periglacial regions.
