Abstract    :
              9321949  Sokolsky       This grant supports research with the Fly's Eye 
              detector and prototype improved High Resolution (HiRes)  versions of  that
              device to study cosmic-rays at the very  highest energies yet observed or
              expected to be observed on  earth.  A 14-mirror prototype Hi Res array has been
              in  operation since March, 1993 at one site and a 4-mirror array  at another,
              13 km distant, has been in operation since the  beginning of 1994 at the Dugway
              proving grounds in Utah.  Together, the two arrays allow stereo reconstruction
              of  shower directions.  Events are also detected in coincidence  with CASA/MIA
              ground array and with Fly's Eye II 3.4km  distant.  The Utah group in
              collaboration with physicists  from Columbia University, the University of
              Illinois, and  the University of Adelaide, Australia seek to determine the 
              energy distribution of cosmic-ray primaries and their  composition.  The
              overarching goal of these studies is to  identify sources and understand the
              natural accelerating  mechanisms that produce particle energies much greater
              than  any achieved with accelerators.  ***
