Abstract    :
                93-21500    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in
              support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V
              BLUEFIN, a 72 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the Institute. 
              Instrumentation requested includes a digital field fluorometer for continuous
              underway measurements.  The instrumentation requested is required for support
              of NSF-funded cruises aboard the BLUEFIN during 1994 and will enhance the
              scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
