Abstract    :
              9321404  Guthrie  This study will examine two contending theories which account
              for the tremendous extinction of large mammals about 11,000 years ago.  Nearly
              80% of the American large mammal species were lost over a rather short period
              of time.  The human overkill theory argues that Paleoindian large-mammal
              hunters from Asia expanded rapidly into the Americas, overexploiting their prey
              species.  The other theory proposes that a radical ecological shift at the end
              of the Pleistocene produced such biotic perturbations that many species could
              not adapt with sufficient rapidity.  A new test will examine the geographic
              pattern of woolly mammoth extinction of a much finer scale that has been
              attempted previously.  Alaska and the Yukon Territory are the focus of this
              study because they were a critical geographic link between the Old and New
              World.  This project is part of the paleo component of the Arctic System
              Science (ARCSS) Program.  ARCSS is part of the U.S. Global Change Research
              Program.  ***
