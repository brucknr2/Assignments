Abstract    :
              9321698  CIFUENTES  This Research Fellowship in Marine Biotechnology will 
              investigate the molecular genetics and biochemistry of the  enzyme, glutamine
              synthetase in a true marine bacterium to  better understand nitrogen metabolism
              of marine  bacterioplankton. The glnA gene will be cloned from the  marine
              bacterium strain RM-1 and sequenced. RM-1, an aerobic  obligate oligrotrophic
              bacterium, was isolated using  dilution culture techniques by D Button of the
              University of  Alaska, Fairbanks. This technique helps isolate the most 
              abundant strain rather than those which are most easily  cultured in the
              laboratory. If the cloning and sequencing of  glnA proceeds on schedule, than
              RM-1 glutamine synthetase  expressed in an E. coli mutant will be purified and
              used to  generate anitsera for probing of the glutamine synthetase  activity in
              natural samples. Probes of metabolic function  developed in this Fellowship
              will be applied to an on-going  collaborative study of nitrogen biogeochemistry
              in the Gulf  of Mexico. Understanding the molecular genetics of a key  enzyme
              in the nitrogen metabolism of a typical marine  bacterium will provide new
              information on physiological  function in oligotrophic environments and improve
              the  understanding of important ecological interactions and  biogeochemical
              processes in N-cycling.  ***
