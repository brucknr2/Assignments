Abstract    :
              9321457  MacAyeal  This award is for support for a project to conduct a
              finite-element  modeling study of the mechanism for Heinrich Events (brief, but
               violent episodes of iceberg disgorgement from the Laurentide Ice  Sheet
              occuring approximately every 7000 years).  The research  assumes that Heinrich
              events were caused by free-oscillations in  the flow of the Laurentide ice
              sheet ("binge/purge" oscillator  theory) which arose because the floor of
              Hudson Bay and Hudson  Strait is covered with soft, unconsolidated sediment
              that forms a  slippery lubricant when thawed.  The modeling work will be novel
              in  the sense that two separate finite-element grids, each designed to 
              optimize computational performance under the restrictions of  diverse ice flow
              mechanisms, will be used to asynchronously advance  the ice thickness
              distribution (and other fields) of the Laurentide  ice sheet through time.  The
              outcome of the proposed research will  include: 1) a verification of the
              binge/purge oscillator theory of  Heinrich Events through comparison of model
              output with the  geologic record, 2) estimation of the ice-rafted debris flux 
              associated with various methods of basal debris entrainment, and 3) 
              determination of the pre- and post-Heinrich Event ice topographies  for use in
              atmospheric circulation models.  ***
