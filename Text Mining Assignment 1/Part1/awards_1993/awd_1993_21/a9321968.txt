Abstract    :
              Abstract - Winnick - 9321968      Each year the United States produces in excess
              of ten million tons of hydrogen sulfide, primarily as a by-product in the
              refining of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas.  This toxic gas is
              generated in the desorption of the solvent, typically an amine or alcohol, used
              to purify the hydrocarbon stream.  Because hydrogen sulfide has no large-scale
              commercial use, most of it is converted to sulfur in the Claus Process, which
              is and incomplete oxidation with air such that hydrogen sulfide and oxygen
              react to form elemental solid sulfur and water.  This is an exothermic reaction
              which releases heat, normally captured in the form of steam.  A more efficient
              method, which generates electricity rather than heat, is being studied in this
              research project.    A high-temperature solid oxide fuel cell which uses
              hydrogen sulfide as the fuel and air as the oxidant is in development.  Such a
              device can produce clean electrical energy and simultaneously convert highly
              toxic gas into a safe raw material.  Solid oxide electrolytes seem tolerant to
              hydrogen sulfide and operate at temperatures above the boiling point of sulfur,
              thus eliminating the poisoning effect of condensed sulfur at the negative
              electrode.  Preliminary experimental results have shown high electrochemical
              activity.  The nature of the chemical and the electrochemical reactions on
              appropriate electrode and electrolyte materials needs to be established.  
              These materials must withstand the corrosive nature of the reactant gases,
              while remaining conductive and mechanically stable.  Several candidate
              materials will be tested for performance and stability in actual fuel cell runs
              and under more controlled experimental conditions.
