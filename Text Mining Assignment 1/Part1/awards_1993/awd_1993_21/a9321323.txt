Abstract    :
              9321323  Wake   This is a proposal to study the role of the environment in
              generating differences among organisms, using the salamander family
              Plethodontidae as a model.  The project will examine the reaction norm (range
              of differences) of number of trunk vertebrae with respect to developmental
              temperature in the salamander family Plethodontidae.  Reaction norms will be
              determined by raising clutches in different temperature environments.  These
              data will then be examined within the framework of a phylogenetic
              (genealogical) hypothesis for these salamanders.  %%%   This work will reveal
              1) basic patterns of change in this anatomical system, particularly in the
              amount of plasticity as determined by environmental variance; 2) the causal
              basis of geographic variation in the salamander genus Batrachoseps; and 3) the
              relationship of plasticity to among-species variation in number of trunk
              vertebrae and other anatomical traits.  This will shed much light on the
              phenomenon of anatomical plasticity in reaction norms in vertebrates.
