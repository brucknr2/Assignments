Abstract    :
              9321628  Brozena and Kovacs  This award supports a geophysical investigation of
              the northern  Canada Basin, part of the Arctic Ocean basin.  A well constrained
               understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Canada Basin is  critical for
              determining the geological evolution of the northern  margins of Alaska,
              Canada, and Siberia, and for determining the  tectonic framework under which
              paleoclimatic change occurred.  The  current regional geophysical knowledge of
              the region is not  complete enough to adequately constrain even zeroth-order
              tectonic  models of the evolution of the region.  This is reflected in the 
              continuing scientific controversy over the timing and most basic  tectonic
              characteristics of those models.      This project will conduct a regional
              aerogravity- aeromagnetic  investigation of the northern Canada Basin with the
              goal of  determining the structure and tectonic evolution of this region. To 
              conduct these flights, Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) will deploy  its RP-3 
              Orion long-range aircraft equipped with the NRL Airborne  Geophysical Sensor
              Suite (AGSS) from Pt. Barrow, Alaska for a one  to two month study over a
              section of the Canada Basin chosen to  provide the highest likelihood of
              important tectonic signatures  diagnostic of opening direction and timing.
              Funds from NSF will  partially support one month of the field program. NRL will
              support  the balance of the costs with internal research funds and support 
              from other Federal agencies.    The AGSS consists of multiple redundant
              gravimeter, kinematic GPS,  and radar/laser altimeter systems in addition to a
              standard  airborne proton precession magnetometer. This system has 
              successfully collected over 200,000 line-km of high quality  gravity,
              magnetics, and topography data over Greenland in 1991 and  1992.  In addition,
              40,000 line-km of similar data were collected  over the northern Canada Basin
              adjacent to Arctic Canada in 1992 as  a pilot program for the proposed work. 
              Typically, the accuracy of  the system at the  altitudes and speeds proposed
              (600m and 240  knots) is about 2- 3 mGal (root-mean-square) at the track 
              crossings, resolving crustal features with wavelengths of 15 km and  longer.   
              The project will be performed under the framework of a cooperative, 
              international program involving scientists from the United States,  Canada, and
              Russia.  This work will yield an geophysical data set  that will be used to
              interpret the tectonic and geologic evolution  of the region but the data set
              will also be used by many parts of  the broader earth sciences community.
