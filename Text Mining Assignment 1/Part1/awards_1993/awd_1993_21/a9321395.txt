Abstract    :
              9321395  Hafner  Pocket gophers and their louse parasites have been shown to
              have similar phylogenetic (genealogical) histories.  The proposed study
              analyses this relationship in detail by examining pocket gophers and two groups
              of chewing lice that parasitize the gophers.  In addition it examines the
              historical relationships between gophers and an internal parasite, the
              whipworms.  The study will compare phylogenies of gophers and their parasites
              using mitochondrial DNA nucleotide sequence differentiation.  These data offer
              an opportunity directly to quantify the genetic change associated with the host
              and parasite phylogenies, and to evaluate the historical importance of
              vertebrate host-parasite associations.
