Abstract    :
              9321105     Lettenmier    The goal of BOREAS is "to improve our understanding of
              the  interactions between the boreal forest biome and the atmosphere.   The
              experimental design is based on intensive observations during  summer, 1994, of
              two study areas of approximate size 400-600 km2,  near the northern and
              southern limits of the boreal forest biome.   The study areas, which are about
              600 km apart, are near Thompson,  Manitoba, and Nipawin, Saskatchewan. The
              objectives of this project  are to acquire a radar data set for the BOREAS
              Southern Study Area  (SSA) to define the spatial variability of precipitation
              in the  summer of 1994 in 160 km diameter circle centered in the SSA.  The 
              precipitation is maximum in mid-summer and is associated with  convective
              storms.  Understanding the spatial distribution of  summer precipitation, and
              the associated dynamics of soil moisture,  are critical to the goal of BOREAS. 
              Knowledge of the space-time  distribution of soil moisture, and related
              runoff-generation  mechanisms that affect evaporative fluxes under conditions
              of soil  limitation, will be essential for studies exploring the  interactions
              of boreal vegetation, trace gas fluxes, and other  aspects of land-atmosphere
              dynamics in northern climates.   Upscaling detailed local-scale energy and mass
              balances, and  biophysical studies using remote sensing and modelling is an 
              essential component.  Upscaling is important because transport  mechanisms
              occur at the scale of hundreds of km, but the governing  processes are largely
              measure at the field scale.  The PI's BOREAS  research is funded by NASA and
              the proposed funding would, in its  entirety, go toward the cost of locating,
              operating, and processing  data collected from a C-band precipitation radar. 
              The cost would  be shared with the Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service
              (AES).   The proposal should be considered as representative of a general  need
              of the BOREAS community.  ***
