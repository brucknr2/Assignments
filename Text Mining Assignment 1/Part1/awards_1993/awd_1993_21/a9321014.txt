Abstract    :
              Proposal #9321014  Bean    This award is in NSF's program on Management of
              Technological Innovation its purpose is to create a data base on industrial R&D
              activities that may support research on the management of technological
              innovation.  The data base would be made available to researchers whose studies
              can benefit detailed information about the organizational structures,
              management practices, R&D resources allocation decisions and business outcomes
              of technology intensive firms operating in business sectors that are of
              substantial  importance to the U.S. economy.    This data base will provide
              useful contextual information about R&D investment levels, innovation
              management practices and outcome of technological innovation activities in
              specific sectors of industry.  This contextual information, which can be used
              to describe innovation management "norms" for these sectors, is intrinsically
              valuable, since such data does not presently exist at the business sectors
              level.  Additionally, the data base will be helpful in interpreting the results
              of research on innovation management practices and business performance in
              these industrial sectors.      This project is carried out jointly by the
              Center for Innovation Management Studies (CIMS) at Lehigh University and the
              Industrial Research Institute (IRI).  The data base employs information
              provided to CIMS by large R&D performing firms who are members of the IRI .
