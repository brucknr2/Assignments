Abstract    :
              9321917  Schwaegerle  Rising levels of greenhouse gases are expected to bring
              about a  host of changes in climate and terrestrial ecosystems.  These  changes
              are expected to be greatest at high latitudes. This  project will assess the
              capacity of three important arctic plant  species to adapt to new environments
              that may arise as a  consequence of climate change. Because the exact nature of
              future  climate change is at present unclear, this research will focus on 
              plant response to multiple environmental factors including  temperature,
              moisture, CO2, and nutrients.  In this way, models  of evolutionary response
              will be developed that have predictive  value among a range of alternative
              scenarios of climate change.   A series of experiments will focus on plant
              growth rate and  morphological traits, relationships between traits and growth,
               and quantitative genetic analysis.  This research is expected to  produce
              evolutionary models of each species that describe (1) the  capacity of arctic
              plant populations to adapt to new environments  and (2) the patterns of
              morphological and physiological changes  that would be favored by natural
              selection in these altered  environments.  ***
