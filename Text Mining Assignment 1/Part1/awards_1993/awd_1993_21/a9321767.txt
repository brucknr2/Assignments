Abstract    :
              9321767  Schilling       Under the direction of faculty adviser Dr. Edward
              Schilling at  the University of Tennessee, graduate student Robert Duff is 
              employing molecular and morphological analyses to study the North  American
              species of the primitive, spore-bearing plant Isoetes.   The so-called
              quillworts (from the quill-like resemblance of their  small leaves) grow in
              ponds, streams, or vernal pools, usually in  small and highly restricted
              populations, scattered across the  continent.  Currently about 25 species are
              recognized in North  America, and about 150 total in the world.  The fossil
              record of  quillworts shows the genus to be ancient; there is some evidence 
              that it is one of the three surviving genera of the most primitive  lineage of
              vascular land plants.  New molecular data from  chloroplast DNA
              restriction-enzyme mapping and from nucleotide  sequencing of nuclear ribosomal
              DNA will be compared to traditional  taxonomic information from morphology and
              chromosomes to develop a  robust hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships of
              the North  American species, and then to explore patterns of character 
              evolution and geographical distribution.       The generation of new molecular
              evidence from DNA analyses and  the integration of that information with
              traditional morphological  characters are revitalizing the taxonomic study of
              plants.  Isoetes  will be better understood as a result of this investigation.
