Abstract    :
              9321283  Wu   The research projects are in the general area of several complex 
              variables and Riemannian geometry. The main focus will be on  classes of
              holomorphic symmetric 2-tensor fields called holmets.  These can be used to
              study the analytic and geometric properties  of complex manifolds, in
              particular, embedded submanifolds of  complex Euclidean spaces. Other topics
              proposed entail curvature  properties of bounded domains in complex spaces.
              This research  has potential applications to algebraic geometry and complex 
              analysis.  ***
