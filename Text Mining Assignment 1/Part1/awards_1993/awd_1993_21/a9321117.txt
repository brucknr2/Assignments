Abstract    :
              9321117  Schott  Scientists have collegial circles that influence their
              research.   This dissertation will examine how these circles differ between 
              men and women scientists and how the circles differ between the  United States
              and other countries.  Scientists have been surveyed  in a dozen other countries
              but at only one U.S. university, where  the number of women scientists is too
              small to enable inference.   This grant will support interviews with 80 or more
              scientists at  four other U.S. universities.  Preliminary analyses suggest that
               gender does affect the composition of scientists' circles of  colleagues. 
              Notably, at least for scientists in other countries,  there is a tendency for
              same-sex selection.  The dissertation  will contribute to the understanding of
              how gender affects  informal communication and organization in science and how 
              national contexts shape these gender effects.  ***
