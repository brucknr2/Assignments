Abstract    :
              9321336 Muller Karger  There are several areas in the ocean where conditions
              appear to be optimal for phytoplankton growth.  However, chlorophyll
              concentrations remain low in spite of persistently high major nutrient levels. 
              One of the oldest explanations for this condition concerns iron deficiency.
              With the development and use of "clean" techniques, evidence supporting the
              "iron" hypothesis has been obtained in bottle experiments performed in several
              independent investigations.  Nevertheless, many question the validity of these
              experiments because of various adverse bottle containment effects.    Thus it
              has become apparent that the next step in testing the iron  hypothesis should
              involve the performance of unenclosed mesoscale (10 100 km2)  iron
              fertilization experiments. However adding a missing essential element to a way
              to proceed is unclear. Through OCE 9297518 and OCE 9024373, in collaboration
              with ONR, such an experiments will be undertaken. The type of iron to be used
              will be determined as well as the best way to administer it to a 75 km2
              "patch".  Initial experiments will be performed in the high nutrient, low
              chlorophyll region south of the Galapagos Islands.  The patch will be tracked
              using the inert tracer sulphur hexaflouride. Chlorophyll and nutrients as well
              as other variables will be monitored to determine the effects of the added
              iron.  In conjunction with this research a study will be made of the high
              chlorophyll, low nutr ient water west of the Galapagos Islands. This area is of
              interest since it appears to represent a natural enrichment experiment. This
              interagency transfer provides NSF's share of the costs for NASA P 3B
              overflights to provide real time remotely sensed measurements, necessary for
              the success for this experiments.
