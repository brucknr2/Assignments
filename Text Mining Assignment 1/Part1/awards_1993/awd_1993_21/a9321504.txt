Abstract    :
              9321504  Oliver  Ice scouring is the most disruptive and widespread physical 
              disturbance to marine bottom communities in polar waters.  At  high latitudes,
              ice pressure ridges scour the sea floor to depths  of 60m, and larger ice bergs
              ground as deep as 400m.  This  project will explore the ecological implications
              of this  disturbance to arctic benthic populations and communities.  It is  a
              multi-disciplinary and joint Canadian-U.S. Program involving  two major
              components.  The first is to characterize and model the  physical disturbance
              regime over a three-year period by  repetitive mapping the study areas with
              high resolution side-scan  sonar, and to quantify the scour recovery process by
              divers.   This approach will enable us to identify newly formed scours each 
              season, and to generate quantitative and ecologically relevant  data on
              disturbance coverage, frequency, intensity, and physical  recovery.  The second
              component is to investigate benthic  population and community responses to ice
              scour, documenting the  successional stages of biotic recovery.  They will test
              whether  observed widespread patterns of zonation and larger spatial and 
              temporal community mosaics are correlated to this key  disturbance.  This
              combined physical and biotic approach will  enable them to develop a conceptual
              model of scour aging and  recovery, and to evaluate the impact of this
              disturbance on  benthic production and diversity.  ***
