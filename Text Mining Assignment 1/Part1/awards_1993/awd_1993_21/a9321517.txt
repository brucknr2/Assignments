Abstract    :
              9321517 Smith          Boltonia decurrens, a perennial member of the Asteraceae
              endemic to the Illinois River floodplain, appears to be disappearing from its
              native habitat.  The number of naturally occurring populations, which
              fluctuates annually, continues to show a net decline.  In 1988 USF&WS declared
              B. decurrens to be nationally threatened species.  It is currently listed as
              endangered in Missouri and threatened in Illinois.          The proposed study
              will enable Dr. Smith to use the extensive data base developed to study a
              threatened and endangered floodplain species, Boltonia decurrens.  Emergency
              funds are needed to conduct immediate post flood surveys of population sites
              where plants were known to exist from 1990 1992.  This will enable assessment
              of the impact of wide spread, prolonged flooding on natural and restored
              populations, and recommendations concerning construction of new levees where
              populations have survived.  The information can be used in the formulation of
              an amended recovery plan to enable government agencies to make scientifically
              valid recommendations and optimize site management.
