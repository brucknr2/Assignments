Abstract    :
                               9321818             Willigen             This project supports
              the dissertation research of a cultural            anthropologist from the
              University of Kentucky.  The student will            study how forced
              resettlement of a rural population (due to the            construction of a
              major water control project) in India has            affected their medical
              beliefs and practices.  The design            includes a comparison village
              which has not been relocated, and            one which has.  Using structured
              interviews, participant            observation, and several techniques of
              cognitive anthropology to            elicit medical belief models, the student
              will explore the            unintended consequences of forced relocation.      
                    This research is important because of the frequency in the           
              developing world of forced relocation, due to development            projects
              such as this project studies.  The consequence of such            relocation on
              the health of the impacted peoples is usually            harmful, yet we have
              no understanding of how the impacted            people's understanding of
              health issues changes in response to            the many changes in their
              living situations.  In depth case            studies such as this one can help
              planners understand community            reactions to relocation, and help
              design programs to minimize            harmful effects.             ***
