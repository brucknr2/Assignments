Abstract    :
              9321167  German    It is proposed to organize a meeting with about 30
              participants on  small powder sintering on November 3-4, at Pennsylvania State 
              University.  Travel support will be provided for about 15  participants, who
              will have presentations.  The size scale of  emphasis will be below 1
              micrometer and will include nanoscale  powders, for which the research methods
              and data bases are in  development.  Critical technical issues related to basic
              phenomena  and sintering techniques will be reviewed,a nd research trends will 
              be identified.  The factors affecting the quality of the resulted  nanoscale
              and micron-size microstructure will be reviewed.  The  meeting will foster
              interaction between different research  disciplines, and between university and
              industry.  A report will be  prepared to identify the current state-of-the-art
              and future  research directions.    Applications of small powder sintering are
              advanced materials with  controlled microstructure and properties, including
              submicron  metallic, ceramic, intermetallic and composite structures.  ***
