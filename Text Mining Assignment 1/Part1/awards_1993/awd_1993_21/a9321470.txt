Abstract    :
              9321470  Sauer  This comparative research project will examine U.S. and British 
              mine safety training programs in order to identify the rhetorical  and social
              understandings necessary for successful safety training.   The proposed project
              will bring together recently established  social-theoretical research in the
              public understanding of science  with rhetorical and feminist analysis of
              scientific and technical  discourse.  The research will 1) compare the
              structure, content,  administration, and philosophy of U.S. and British mine
              safety  education programs and training requirements; 2) identify domains  of
              expert and contextually-generated knowledge about risk and  safety in U.S. and
              British mines; 3) define the visual and verbal  conventions and rhetorical
              assumptions that govern operational  training tesxts in the U.S. and Britain;
              4) define how programs  assign responsibility and authority to various social
              groups for  hazard prevention in mines; 5) explore the social understandings 
              and expertise that enable miners to interpret and actively make  sense of
              safety procedures and risk in the mines; and 6) draw  broader conclusions about
              the role of social understandings in the  construction and interpretation of
              safety procedures and  instruction manuals.  The results of the research will
              be presented  in papers and at conferences.  The investigators also plan to
              make  results available to government agencies with responsibilities for  mine
              safety, and to offer some practical recommendations for  developing more
              effective safety training and education programs to  reduce risk in mines.  ***
