Abstract    :
              9321166  Cline    This grant will support an international symposium which  will
              focus on issues pertaining to the most recent  information on the dark matter
              in the Universe, the early  history of the Universe, and the connection between
               cosmology, particle physics, and astronomy.  The symposium  is to be held in
              Santa Monica, California, on February 16  through 18, 1994, and will be hosted
              by the University of  California, Los Angeles.  The goal of the symposium is to
               achieve a better understanding of the role of elementary  particles and early
              universe cosmology, including  superstrings in the future development of the
              field.  In  pursuing this goal, we will explore the large-scale  structure of
              the Universe and the microwave background  properties since these impact
              directly on the subject of  Astroparticle Physics.  The symposium will provide
              answers  which help define directions of research for the future.  The
              proceedings of the symposium will be published.  ***
