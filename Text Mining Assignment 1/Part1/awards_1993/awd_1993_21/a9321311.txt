Abstract    :
              9321311  Newton  The Maize Genetics group has met on an annual basis for the
              past 35  years to discuss recent research advances.  A broad range of topics 
              are covered from cytogenetics to molecular genetics and includes  chromosome
              mechanics, cytoplasmic inheritance, mapping,  transposable element behavior,
              gene identification and expression,  development, tissue culture and
              transformation.  Although most  participants are from academic institutions in
              the U.S., a number  of European scientists and increasing numbers of industry- 
              affiliated scientists attend.  It is also usually the first meeting  that U.S.,
              graduate students in maize genetics laboratories attend.   The emphasis is on
              reporting recent, unpublished data and  presentations by graduate students and
              postdoctoral researchers are  strongly encouraged.  The meeting is an essential
              gathering for  scientists working with maize, but is open to other plant 
              scientists who wish to learn from the strong heritage of maize  genetics. 
              Indeed, there is a long tradition of cooperation and the  open sharing of
              information and stocks in the maize genetics  community.  To perpetuate the
              spirit of free exchange and  cooperation is one of the most important
              objectives of the meeting.   The format has evolved with time and with the
              increased attendance,  but the strong sense of community has been retained. 
              ****  The Maize Genetics Meeting will be held March 24-27, 1994 at the 
              Pheasant Run Conference Center, near Chicago, Illinois.  The  localized site
              will enhance the interactions between the  established investigators and
              younger scientists, all of whom use  corn as an experimental organism
              regardless of their expertise and  interests.  Thus, many of these productive
              interactions would not  occur except for this meeting.  %%%%
