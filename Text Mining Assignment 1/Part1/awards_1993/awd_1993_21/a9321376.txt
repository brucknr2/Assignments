Abstract    :
              9321376  Waddington  This award is for support for a three year project to
              obtain temperature logs in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) and
              Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) boreholes at Summit, Greenland using the U.S.
              Geological Survey's (U.S.G.S.) high precision temperature logging system. 
              Temperatures will also be logged in several dry holes near GISP2 and GRIP,
              since the upper 100 meters in the main holes have been thermally disturbed by
              the drill domes and drilling activities.  The data are needed to derive surface
              paleotemperatures directly from the present-day temperature transients
              remaining at depth at these sites, and to better calibrate the isotope
              paleothermometer over the past 25,000 years.  Simultaneous inversion of high
              precision data from both deep holes will allow isolation of the paleoclimate
              signal from ice dynamics effects.  The temperature data may also allow
              detection of rapid shearing in the silty basal ice, thus providing a test
              independent of the borehole deformation.  ***
