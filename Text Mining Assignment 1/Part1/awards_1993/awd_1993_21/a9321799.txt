Abstract    :
              9321799  Dey  This project seeks to develop efficient algorithms for 
              triangulating spaces (polytopes, point sets), to design efficient  topological
              algorithms for triangulated spaces, and to understand  the combinatorial
              aspects of triangulated spaces.  Triangulated  spaces appear in many
              applications, and have immediate  theoretical interest as well.    The focus
              will first be on algorithms for polytope triangulations  and point set
              triangulations in higher dimensions.  Finite  element methods apply
              triangulations to decompose the domains,  while computer graphics and solid
              modeling use them to represent  objects with simpler components and to
              manipulate them  efficiently.    Next, the investigation will concentrate on 
              topological  algorithms with triangulated spaces for two problems: (i) 
              determining the homology groups of simplicial complexes in  arbitrary
              dimensions, (ii) detecting if two given cycles on a  simplicial complex can be
              continuously deformed to one another.  Computational topology, an emerging
              field, examines the  computational aspects of topological problems.  The
              constructive  approaches would inject algorithmic theories into topology, 
              making it more useful in practical applications.    To understand triangulated
              spaces, one needs to know more about  their combinatorial behavior.  The focus
              in the latter half of  the project will be on such combinatorial questions as
              counting  the number of crossings in a set of simplices and counting the 
              number of combinatorially different triangulations for a point  set.
