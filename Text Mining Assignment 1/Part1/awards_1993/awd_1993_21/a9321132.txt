Abstract    :
              Pittler  9321132    During development many different cell types are formed that
               must migrate to their proper locations in central nervous  system (CNS)
              tissues such as brain and retina.  It is during  this time that neural networks
              are formed that remain for  the life of the organism.  A pathway in the rat
              retina has  been identified that when perturbed leads to gross  morphological
              disruption of the distribution of retinal  cells with minimal degenerative
              changes.  It is hypothesized  that this pathway is involved in maintaining cell
               architecture and overall cell morphology of CNS tissue.  It  is also possible
              that this pathway functions to direct  migration of cells to their proper
              location during  development.  This pathway in the retina is being 
              characterized beginning with the identification of the  proteins involved.  The
              location of these proteins within  the retina will be analyzed and compared
              with the location  of the major structural elements that exist within cells. 
              From these results the proteins that mediate the observed  cell changes, their
              distribution within cells, and the major  structural elements that are affected
              can be determined.  This will contribute significantly to our understanding of 
              structure\function relationships in the CNS.
