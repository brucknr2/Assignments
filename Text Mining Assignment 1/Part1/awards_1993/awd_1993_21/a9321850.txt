Abstract    :
              9321850  Birge    Technical abstract:  The low temperature electrical properties
              of  mesoscopic metal samples will be studied in order to uncover new  physical
              phenomena that are unique to the mesoscopic regime.  The  specific problems to
              be studied include dissipative quantum  tunneling of single defects in
              disordered metals, modulation of  microscopic defect properties by externally
              applied electric and  strain fields, and the role of mesoscopic superconductors
              in  enhancing electronic quantum phase coherence.  Measurements of 1/f  noise
              in larger samples complement the mesoscopic measurements by  providing
              statistical information about defects in disordered  systems.    Non-technical
              abstract:  This proposal focuses on two areas of  study related to disordered
              metals.  The first is the study of  individual, atomic defects.  By carefully
              measuring the electrical  conductance of sub micrometer samples, one can detect
              the motion of  a single atom within the sample.  This type of study reveals 
              details about individual defects that are not obtainable from  studies of
              larger samples.  The second area of study is the  quantum-mechanical behavior
              of electrons in metals at low  temperature.  Due to their wave-like nature,
              electrons in metals  exhibit interference.  In sub micrometer samples of normal
              and  superconducting materials, this interference leads to a number of  new,
              intriguing electrical properties.  These effects can have  potential impact on
              the development of future mesoscopic devices.  ***
