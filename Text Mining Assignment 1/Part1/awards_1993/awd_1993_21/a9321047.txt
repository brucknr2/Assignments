Abstract    :
              9321047  Liebhaber  MCI will provide the NSFNET very high speed Backbone Network
               Service (vBNS) as defined in project solicitation NSF 93-52.  This  service
              will be operated from MCI's production telecommunications  infrastructure based
              on SONET technology.  Five supercomputer  center (SCCs) and the NSF designated
              Network Access Points (NAPs)  will be interconnected to the vBNS.  Access to
              the vBNS will  commence at SONET OC-3 data rates (155 Mbps) with Asynchronous 
              Transfer Mode (ATM) access and will increase to gigabit per second  rates over
              the 5 year award period.  OC-12 access (655 Mbps) is  estimated to be available
              by 1996.  By 1998 an OC-192 (9.6  Gbits/sec) SONET backbone with OC-48 (2.$
              GBits/sec) access to SCCs  is anticipated.  MCI will make a Testnet available
              in support of  experimentation with new telecommunications technologies.
