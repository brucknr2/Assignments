Abstract    :
              9321602  Muhleman    The Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) 5-element
              millimeter array  will be activated in July of 1994 to observe the Jovian
              atmospheric effects  of the impact of the fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. 
              The  instrument will be operated in the continuum mode near a wavelength of  3
              millimeter.  The primary atmospheric effect expected is a strong  disturbance
              in the ammonia layer within and above the ammonia ice  clouds on Jupiter.  The
              measurements offer a unique way to sense the  impacts and to estimate the
              energy release.
