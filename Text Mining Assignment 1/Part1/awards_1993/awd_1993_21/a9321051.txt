Abstract    :
              9321051  Bresnahan  The National Bureau of Economic Research - Conference on
              Research  on Income and Wealth - organizes research conferences on timely 
              topics emphasizing empirical issues.  The conferences bring  together empirical
              researchers from government, academia, and the  private sector.  The different
              researchers include economists and  statisticians with interests in
              methodology, statistics, economic  theory, and policy.  This particular
              conference will focus on  measurement, interpretative, and conceptual issues
              arising from  the economic importance of new goods and services.  It will 
              address current concerns associated with incorporating new  products and
              services into output and price indexes.  ***
