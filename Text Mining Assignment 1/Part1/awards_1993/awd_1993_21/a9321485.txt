Abstract    :
              9321485  Brandon  Dr. Brandon is examining the nature of experimentation in 
              population biology (ecology and evolution), and the relation  between theory
              and experiment in this field.  After years of  neglect, philosophers (as well
              as historians and sociologists) of  science are beginning to take
              experimentation seriously.  Much of  this attention focuses on physics and
              assumes that experiment is  subservient to theory.  Biology, rather than
              physics, is the focus  of this project, which also questions the assumption
              that theory  generally dominates experimentation.  Dr. Brandon's preliminary 
              work has already shown that population biology is importantly  distinct from
              physics with respect to experimentation (biologists  are much more concerned
              with what might be called the "realism" of  their experimental conditions).  In
              this study, he hopes to show,  by means of case studies, that there are various
              reasons why theory  and experiment fail to make contact and explore the
              ramifications  of this.  Dr. Brandon brings his skills in philosophical
              analysis  (e.g. in answering the question of what an experiment is and how 
              experiments contribute to scientific knowledge) and an intimate  acquaintance
              with largely contemporary experimental practice in  population biology.    ***
