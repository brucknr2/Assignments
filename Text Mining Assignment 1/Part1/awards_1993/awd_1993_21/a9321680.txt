Abstract    :
              9321680 Platt Mesic hardwood forests of the southeastern United States have two
              distinct strata with a rich mixture of evergreen and deciduous species of
              trees. Hurricanes are a major and common disturbance in these forest systems.
              Two contrasting theoretical models have been proposed: the cyclical succession
              model and the disturbance dynamics model. The PI's will test specific
              hypotheses derived from these contrasting models. The hypotheses focus on
              effects of large scale disturbances on the expected trend in populations of
              overstory species, specifically in reference to the impacts of Hurricane Kate
              which struck this area in the mid-1980's. The analyses will be based on data
              derived from a 4.5 ha permanent plot that was originally sampled and mapped in
              1978. The PI's will remap the plot and use the temporal data set to address a
              series of questions and predictions concerning patterns of species replacement
              and community dynamics over time in these forests.  %%% Although this project
              will focus on dynamics in southern coastal plain hardwood forests, these
              analyses address general problems and questions regarding the relative
              importance of autogenic and allogenic factors in the control of community
              dynamics and species diversity in forest ecosystems. ***
