Abstract    :
              9321392  Lund    This is a study of the zeolite ZSM-5 as a catalyst for the 
              chlorination of toluene.  Of the three possible monochlorination  products,
              p-chlorotoluene is the most valuable; in other reactions  involving
              alkylaromatics, ZSM-5 is selective for formation of the  para isomer.  In this
              work, a form of ZSM-5 in which iron cations  are present in ion-exchange
              positions of the zeolite is used.  The  first (chronologically) objective of
              the study is to determine  whether the catalyst deactivates under reaction
              conditions, and if  so, to measure the severity of the deactivation and
              determine its  origin.  The second objective is to probe the active site using 
              sorption capacity and selectivity, Mossbauer spectroscopy, infrared 
              spectroscopy of adsorbed species, transmission electron microscopy,  acidity
              measurements, chemical analysis, ion exchange, and other  techniques. 
              Catalysts are prepared with various degrees of  dehydration, location of iron,
              and silicon/aluminum ratios.   Reactor studies are performed to measure
              catalytic activity and  selectivity.  The third objective is to develop a
              mechanistic  microkinetic model of the reaction kinetics from steady-state and 
              transient kinetics measurements and temperature-programmed  desorption data. 
              The performance of ZSM-5 is compared  quantitatively to that of conventional
              Lewis-acid catalysts.    Chlorinations and related aromatic substitution
              reactions are  widely used in chemical manufacturing.  They are presently done 
              using relatively large amounts of inexpensive (and not very active)  catalysts
              that create large amounts of solid waste that is now  recognized to be an
              environmental problem.  This work aims to  replace such processes with ones
              that employ small amounts of more  active catalysts that are relatively benign
              environmentally.  ***
