Abstract    :
                 Affine scaling methods form an important class of   point  algorithms for
              solving a linear programming problem,   and there  have been  some major
              developments in the convergence and  convergence   rate theory of these 
              methods.  In particular, when  the problem may be degenerate,   if the step
              size  is less than  equal to two thirds of the distance to the   boundary, the
              primal  converges to the interior of the optimal face, while the dual   to  the
              analytic  center of the optimal dual face.  Also, by a step  selection  
              strategy, these  methods have been shown to converge  superlinearly. More  
              efficient variants have  also been developed.  Under this project, four
              different   aspects of these  methods are being studied: 1) study of their
              convergence   properties, convergence  rates and complexity; 2) study of stable
              implementations to    achieve these  higher rates of convergence in computer 
              implementations; 3)   study of their  connection to Kalman filter  and their
              application to solving   stochastic linear  programming  problems; and, 4)
              study of their efficient   implementations in  vector/parallel/distributed
              computing environments.
