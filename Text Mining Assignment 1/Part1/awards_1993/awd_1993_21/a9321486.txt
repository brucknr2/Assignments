Abstract    :
              9321486  Rockwell   The goal of this research is to develop phylogenies
              (genealogies) for the hawks, Falconiformes.  There are three major questions to
              be asked: 1) Is the group a natural one, that is, are the families within the
              group each others' closest relatives; 2) What are the relationships among the
              families within Falconiformes; 3) What are the relationships among the falcons
              (Falconidae)?   Sequence data will be collected from the mitochondrial genome. 
              The molecular phylogenies inferred from these data will be compared with
              morphological ones inferred from morphological data generated by Griffths, to
              see how well the results match.  The two data sets will then be combined for
              the final analyses.  %%%   This study will be one of the first to provide both
              morphological and molecular phylogenetic data by the same researcher.  The
              results of the analyses will provide a phylogenetic framework for a wide
              variety of research studies on hawks, including ecological and conservation
              studies.
