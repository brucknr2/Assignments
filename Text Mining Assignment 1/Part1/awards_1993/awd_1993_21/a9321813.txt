Abstract    :
              9321813  Tong       The objective of this research is to explore theoretical and
               practical issues of fast converging "blind" channel identification, 
              equalization, and sequence estimation schemes to combat multipath  fading and
              co-channel interference.  It aims to eliminate or  significantly reduce
              training signals for the equalization of time-  varying wireless communication
              channels.  The research exploits the  second -order (cyclostationary)
              statistical and algebraic  properties of communication signals and the
              communication channel;  it leads to a faster convergence rate than those of
              existing  methods using higher-order statistics.  By combining equalization 
              and coding techniques, the research identifies a frequency  selective fading
              channel and suppresses co-channel interference.   Using the so-called signal
              subspace concepts, an optimal blind  sequence estimation method via the Viterbi
              algorithm is  investigated; its structure is particularly attractive to time- 
              varying channels.  The research consists of theoretical  investigation,
              algorithm development, and experimental  verification.  The significance of the
              work is that it addresses  the two important limitations of TDMA and GDMA based
              systems: the  multipath interference and the multiuser interference.  It has
              the  potential to increase transmission capabilities by eliminating  training
              sequences.  The techniques developed in this research have  a wide range of
              applications including identification of periodic  systems and medical image
              processing.  ***
