Abstract    :
              9321048  Heckman    This project has four interrelated objectives: (1) To
              complete an  evaluation of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) begun under 
              the previous NSF grant.  The project studies the self-selection  bias (if any)
              that characterizes the differences in earnings,  employment and wages between
              participants and non-participants  with an eye toward developing rigorously,
              economically motivated  program evaluation strategies using readily available
              non-  experimental data.  (2)  The study exploits unique data to  develop
              empirically-based models of incentives in organizations  and the responses of
              organizations to externally mandated  performance standards.  This portion of
              the project provides new  information on the economics of bureaucracies and the
              responses  of program managers to incentives. (3)  The study develops and 
              applies econometric methods for estimating dynamic models of  choices among
              alternative possibilities, and the rewards from  these choices. (4)  The study
              considers the empirical, economic  and econometric foundations of the case for
              social experiments.   Both theoretical and empirical studies will be conducted
              on the  benefits and limitations of social experiments.  The responses of 
              training centers to randomization will be investigated.   One  goal of the
              project is to produce a book on the rigorous  evaluation of social programs
              with an emphasis on manpower  training programs.
