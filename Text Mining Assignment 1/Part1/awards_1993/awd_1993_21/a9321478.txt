Abstract    :
              9321478  Mosley-Thompson  This award is for support for a study to conduct anion
              and cation  analyses of samples from polar ice cores to establish an annually 
              resolved 800-year volcanic history for Greenland and a 4000-year  history from
              Antarctica.  The proposed 800-year Greenland record  will complement the
              existing 1000-year record from South Pole  Station and make detailed
              interhemispheric comparisons possible.   The proposed 4000-year Antarctic
              record will extend from the South  Pole volcanic record and ultimately
              complement the longer histories  expected from central Greenland cores. 
              Interhemispheric comparison  of these high resolution (annual to decadal) time
              series will allow  identification of those near-tropical eruptions which
              perturb the  sulfuric acid content of the global atmosphere.  ***
