Abstract    :
                  One of the significant problems in concurrent-software analysis research  is
              achieving a balance between general theoretical concepts and specific 
              practical techniques.  This is the motivation for this research.  The focus of
              the project is on applying and adapting Petri net theory for  solutions to
              pragmatic problems in concurrent-software analysis.  The specific  research
              topics addressed represent natural points of extension from previous  efforts. 
              The research explores Ada tasking analysis issues within the framework  of an
              existing experimental toolkit and also expands on research in analysis of 
              Petri nets using some new reachability concepts and techniques.  One area of 
              emphasis is in empirical studies of various deadlock detection techniques and 
              the applicability of these techniques to generic language structures beyond the
               example of Ada tasking.  A second emphasis is the investigation of a
              generalized  form of reachability graph and its construction.   This area of
              work  exploits some identified connections to recent research in use of
              Binary-Decision  Diagrams (BDDs) for representation of symbolic state spaces.
