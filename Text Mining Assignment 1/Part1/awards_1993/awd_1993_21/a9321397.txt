Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-21397    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V GYRE, a 172 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the
              University.  Instrumentation requested includes computer hardware for the
              shipboard computer system, an automated dissolved oxygen titration system, and
              a gyrocompass interface board for the ADCP. The instrumentation requested is
              required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the GYRE during 1994 and will
              enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
