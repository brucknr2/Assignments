Abstract    :
              9321314  KENNEY  This proposal will examine the administrative development of
              the  European Court of Justice, focusing on comparing the role and  power of
              legal secretaries at the ECJ with those of law clerks at  the U.S. Supreme
              Court.  Legal secretaries at the ECJ are  lawyers, judicial administrators, and
              legal academics, and they  perform many professional roles within the
              administrative  structure of the high court.  The bureaucratization of
              appellate  courts is an important aspect of their political power because it 
              increases staff, and therefore judicial, capacity and permits  judicial
              specialization.  This research is the first effort to  build an extensive data
              base on the workings of the ECJ, thereby  providing the basis for comparison
              with other high courts.    The Principal Investigator will interview a number
              of judges and  legal secretaries at the ECJ, observe the working interactions 
              between legal secretaries and judges, observe oral argument and  gather
              descriptive materials on other internal aspects of  judicial procedure.  ***
