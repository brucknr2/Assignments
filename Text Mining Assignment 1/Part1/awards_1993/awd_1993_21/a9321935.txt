Abstract    :
              Abstract - Dudukovic 9321935      This grant is awarded to provide partial
              support for the 13th International Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering
              (ISCRE-13) which will be held in Baltimore, Maryland, September 25-28, 1994. 
              The funds will be partially used for invited plenary speakers as well as for
              subsidizing the attendance of researchers in the field by lowering the
              registration fees.    Reaction Engineering is the discipline that quantifies
              the interactions of transport phenomena and kinetics in relating reactor
              performance to operating conditions and feed variables.  This quantification
              requires a thorough understanding of the micro-scale (molecular level),
              meso-scale (transport kinetic events on a catalyst particle level) and
              macro-scale (reactor design in the content of process and plant design).  It
              results in methodology that is useful in approaching a variety of systems
              including chemical, biological, biochemical, and electrochemical, where the
              cause and effect relations imparted by reactions and observed in small
              laboratory vessels need to be "scaled-up" to commercial production.  ISCRE
              conferences are unique in that they bring together internationally prominent
              researchers in reaction engineering in a small setting where there is an open
              atmosphere for the exchange of ideas.  This particular meeting has, as its
              underlying theme, the environment, including clean or environmentally benign 
              processing and emission control.
