Abstract    :
              9321892  Connell           The objectives of the present project are several:   
                   1)  To extend the detailed long-term monitoring of  ecological communities
              of corals and algae on the Great  Barrier Reef, Australia which has been
              carried on  continuously over the past 30 years, the longest such study  on any
              coral reef;  2) to expand the study to include sites  on two nearby reefs, and
              additional replicate sites on Heron  Reef;  3) to analyze spatial patterns and
              dynamics of corals  and algae at several scales, from centimeters to tens of 
              meters, both during the course of colonization of  patches  (opened by
              disturbances) and after most of the surface has  become crowded by many
              colonies.  These analyses should  reveal the long-term effects of interactions
              that may be  crucial in determining how natural communities are  structured; 
              4) to test with controlled field experiments  some hypotheses about mechanisms:
              a) that produce the unique  species composition of corals at the Inner Reef
              Flat site,  b) that cause contrasting patterns of algae after  disturbances,
              and c) that determine precisely how each  colony affects its neighbors;  5) to
              build mathematical  models and computer simulations of the dynamics of these 
              populations and communities of corals and algae: a) to  investigate the
              influence of past and present conditions on  future changes, b) to characterize
              temporal and spatial  dynamics, and c) to test hypotheses about the
              consequences  of these dynamics to the community.  The models will be also 
              used to asses the degree to which community structure and  dynamics may or may
              not be influenced by details of spatial  relationships.         The field
              methods will use the standard sampling  techniques used over the past 30 years,
              to assure continuity  in the long-term data base.  The experimental methods,
              using  coral  transplanting and cages to exclude larger herbivores,  have also
              been used before in this study and are well-  established.  Larval  choice
              experiments and new recruit  t ransplants have been carried out successfully by
              the co-  investigators elsewhere on the Great Barrier Reef.         The
              significance of this proposed research to the  advancement of knowledge is
              that: 1) it deepens the general  knowledge of how natural communities of corals
              and algae  (the dominant sessile organisms on tropical and sub-tropical 
              reefs), are assembled and structured in the face of changes  in their
              environment over extended periods of time; 2) it  reveals some of the
              mechanisms that link the environment  with these community changes, and how
              both vary over short  and long time periods and between small and larger
              spatial  scales; and 3) it helps to predict the effect of  environmental
              changes, including those caused by human  activity, on these natural
              communities.
