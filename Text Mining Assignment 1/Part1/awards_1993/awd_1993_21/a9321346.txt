Abstract    :
              9321346  Kangari  The objective of this research is to establish an innovative
              and  creative engineering solution to the existing construction by  exploring
              new ideas and developing a generic framework for  utilization of automation
              technology in flexible construction of an  automated building.  This allows for
              the identification of major  systems variables which must be considered.     
              The scope of the research is limited to: 1) Development and  investigation of
              innovative concepts for automated building  construction materials transfer
              operations, 2) Development and  investigation of new concepts for flexible
              automated building  construction resources.
