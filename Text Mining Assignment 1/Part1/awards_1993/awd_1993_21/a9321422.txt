Abstract    :
              9321422   Menoni      Fundamental materials research will be conducted to
              elucidate and  solve basic material problems which prevent the use of Indium 
              Gallium Aluminum Phosphide for short wavelength semiconductor  lasers.  Growth
              techniques will be developed to obtain highly  efficient multiple quantum well
              structures.  Characterization of  the relevant physical properties of these
              structures will involve  measurement of  carrier confinement, carrier lifetime
              and radiative  efficiency across the whole range of Aluminum composition.  
              These  studies will also evaluate the role of multiple quantum barriers to 
              increase carrier confinement.      %%%   Increased understanding of the
              physical properties of Indium  Gallium Aluminum Phosphide  heterostructures is
              expected to provide  the basis for the design of efficient semiconductor lasers
               operating in the green-to-red region of the visible spectrum.  An  important
              feature of the program is the training of graduate and  undergraduate students
              in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area of materials and
              processing research.  This  research will contribute to improving the general
              performance of  advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing, 
              information processing, and telecommunications.    ***
