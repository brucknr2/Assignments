Abstract    :
              9321733  Davis  This award is for support for a project to refine the glacial 
              chronology on southern Baffin Island by determining cosmogenic  exposure ages
              of polished and striated bedrock surfaces and  morainal boulders.  In order to
              estimate the timing of  deglaciation, the Beryllium-10 and Aluminum-26 in
              quartz separates  from:  1) polished and striated bedrock surfaces on valley
              bottoms  and along fjord sidewalls, and 2) boulders on nested sets of  moraines
              will be measured.  Preliminary results suggest that  deglaciation in the
              Pangnirtung area of southern Baffin Island  occurred around 7,500 years ago. 
              This work will provide  information to help resolve a long-standing controversy
              in  Quaternary science involving the extent of ice sheets in the  eastern
              Canadian Arctic during the late Wisconsinan.  ***
