              principal investigators;  to continue data handling and development of a
              "final" data set; to coordinate ice core collection activities in Denver at the
              National Ice Core Laboratory; to guide and organize statistical tools; to
              maintain current  ties with the European Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP); to
              include additional viewpoints and disciplines; to handle specific issues (e.g.
              dating and intercalibration); to coordinate workshops and meetings; to organize
              final products including a compendium volume and papers; and continued
              communications with principal investigators, other scientists, the National
              Science Foundation, GRIP, and the public.  ***
