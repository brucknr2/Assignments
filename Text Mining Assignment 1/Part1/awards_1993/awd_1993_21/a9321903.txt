Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-21903    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V ALPHA HELIX, a 133 foot vessel, which is owned by the NSF
              and operated by the University.  Instrumentation requested includes computer
              hardware, a water sampling rosette, fluorometers, an automated oxygen titration
              system, and a salinometer.  The requested instrumentation is necessary to
              support NSF funded cruises in 1994 and will enhance the scientific capabilities
              of the vessel in the future.
