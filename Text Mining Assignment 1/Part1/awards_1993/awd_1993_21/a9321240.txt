Abstract    :
              9321240  Martin  The  objective of the project is to harmonize six ASTM 
              composite  material  standards  with those developed  by  the  International 
              Organization for Standardization. (IOS)    The data is critically needed for
              composite materials in order to  have the United States industry improve the
              engineering design of  advanced composites and to be competitive in the world
              market.  ***
