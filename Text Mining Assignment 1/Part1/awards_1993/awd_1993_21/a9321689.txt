Abstract    :
              9321689  Goodnight       Inbreeding depression is potentially one of the most
              serious  genetic consequences of reduced population size.  This research is  an
              empirical study on selection for reduced inbreeding depression  among a
              subdivided population, using Tribolium castaneum as the  model system.  It will
              involve a comparison of two migration  schemes, random and differential, among
              a set of fifteen inbred  lineages derived from the same outbred stock
              population.  In the  differential migration scheme, migrants will be sent from
              lineages  suffering from less inbreeding depression to lineages suffering  from
              more inbreeding depression.  In the random migration scheme,  the rate of
              migration will be the same but migrants will be sent at  random with respect to
              levels of inbreeding depression.  A  significant response to selection will be
              evident by a significant  decrease in the level of inbreeding depression in the
              differential  migration scheme, relative to the random migration scheme.%%%    
                The significance of the research lies in its insight into the  quantitative
              aspects of gene flow within and between small,  subdivided populations, an
              issue of considerable significance to  basic population and conservation
              biology.***
