Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Continetti will study the dissociation dynamics of   small
              gas-phase radicals using a negative ion photodetachment apparatus.   
              Continetti will combine negative-ion photodetachment with   neutral-fragment
              translational energy spectroscopy.  Systems of interest   include HO2, CH3O2,
              C2O, and CH2CHO.  The results will provide insights   into the nature of
              dissociative states, decomposition pathways, and bond   dissociation energies
              of these species.    %%%  This research project will examine the molecular
              structure and electronic   composition of a number of unstable and transient
              molecules which are   difficult to study by other techniques.  Possible
              applications of   information obtained from this research include combustion
              chemistry,   atmospheric reactions, chemical vapor deposition, and
              supercritical water   reactors.
