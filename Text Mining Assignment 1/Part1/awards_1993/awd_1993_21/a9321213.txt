Abstract    :
              9321213  Calkin  This award is for a three year study to investigate the
              subarctic  climatic history as recorded largely in the tree-ring record and to 
              precisely date glacial fluctuations of ice tongues terminating in,  and
              occuring at, the margins of the deep, 50-km long fjords  of  Yakutat and Icy
              Bays of southeastern coastal Alaska.  Chronologies  drawn from 500 to 900 year
              old living trees cross-dated with logs  of buried forests at multiple sites in
              each of the fjords, will  provide the main basis for climatic reconstruction
              over the last  two millenia.  Climatic and glacial series together are expected
              to  yield the first sound basis for testing response of fjord glaciers  to
              climate change.  ***
