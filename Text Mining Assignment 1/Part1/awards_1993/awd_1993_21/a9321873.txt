Abstract    :
              9321873  Sengupta  This is an award to support research on a control method for 
              improving the stability of anaerobic biological processes used to  treat
              wastewaters.  The method is based on neutralizing the  effect that intermediate
              biorespiratory products have on the  alkalinity of the fluid being treated and
              providing for selective  removal of heavy metals that have a toxicity effect on
              the  biological species in the reactor.  The porous composite  membranes are
              suspended in the bioreactor.  The membranes consist  of entrapped, polymeric
              ion-exchange microbeads with covalently  attached functional groups having a
              high buffer capacity and  selectivity for heavy metals.    Results of this
              project are expected to provide the basis for  engineering design of anaerobic
              biological reactors that are  amenable for treatment of industrial wastewaters
              characterized by  large fluctuations of organic load, heavy metal content and 
              alkalinity.  Besides improved stability, the operating costs of  treatment
              plants are expected to be significantly reduced from  present levels by
              elimination of need for addition of buffer  salts and regeneration of the
              composite membrane.
