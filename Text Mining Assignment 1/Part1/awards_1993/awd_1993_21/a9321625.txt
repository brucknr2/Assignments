Abstract    :
              9321625  Cochrane       The evolution of insecticide resistance in insect
              populations  is a problem of agricultural, economic and environmental 
              significance.  Yet despite the increasing magnitude of this  problem, the
              genetic basis for the response of an insect population  to insecticides is not
              clearly understood.  Insect populations  exhibit different genetic responses
              under field and laboratory  conditions.  Furthermore, the effects of
              insecticide exposure on  closely related species are unknown.  The research
              will address the  evolution of insecticide resistance in field populations of
              two  closely related species of the fruitfly, Drosophila, which have a  20 year
              history of exposure to the insecticide malathion.  Despite  the close
              relationship of these species, one population is an  average of 10 times more
              resistant than the other.%%%       The immediate goal of the research is to
              determine the genetic  basis for the difference in resistance levels between
              these two  populations.  Classical genetic procedure will be coupled with 
              biochemical analysis of known detoxification systems to identify  major genes
              contributing to malathion resistance.  The basis of  resistance in these
              populations will thus be compared with those  from geographically distinct
              populations of both species to  determine the significance of the differences
              between the species.   This work will be of a direct benefit to agricultural
              pest  management strategies by determining the effect of insecticide  exposure
              on closely related species.  This knowledge may then be  directly used to
              influence the development of future pest  management programs.***
