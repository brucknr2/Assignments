Abstract    :
              93-21542  Smith, J.  Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory    The PI's request
              funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded
              research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V EWING, a 239 foot
              vessel, which is owned and operated by the Observatory.  Instrumentation to be
              purchased includes a continuous seawater analysis system, two EPC 9800 thermal
              recorders, depth transducers for airguns and seismic streamers, six seismic
              airguns and firing solenoid valves, and a set of meteorological sensors.  All
              of this equipment is required for successful scientific operation during
              NSF-funded cruises in 1994.  It will also increase the scientific capabilities
              of the R/V EWING for future cruises.
