Abstract    :
              9321864  Grofman    The multi-party negotiation process in South Africa has set
              a  date of April 27, 1994 for universal suffrage elections to a new 
              constituent assembly that will serve as an interim legislature  and as a
              constitutional drafting body for a new constitution.   The basic election
              mechanism will be list Proportional  Representation (PR) with both local
              constituencies and a national  list.  This investigation involves using a
              combination of hard  and soft data to test a number of specific hypotheses
              about party  strategies and voter choices in this important election - - 
              hypotheses with general implication for the study of the  influence of
              electoral systems on racial and ethnic conflict.    An investigator will spend
              two and one half months in South  Africa observing the campaigning in this
              critical election and  gathering an archive of campaign material and a data
              base about  candidates.  The investigator will remain for several weeks after 
              the election to conduct additional interviews of participants  (both winners
              and losers) and of academic and journalistic  sources and to collect a complete
              data set of election outcomes  at the magisterial district (precinct
              equivalent) level and data  sets from as many public opinion polls as are
              available.  These  data will also be used to generate simulations of the likely
               electoral consequences had alternative electoral systems been  used.  ***
