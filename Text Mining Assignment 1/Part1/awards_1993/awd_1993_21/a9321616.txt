Abstract    :
              9321616  Stuessy       The ornamental peonies and their wild relatives, placed
              in the  isolated genus Paeonia, have fascinated and puzzled botanists for  many
              years.  Combining primitive and advanced morphological  features, peonies have
              been related phylogenetically to numerous  disparate groups of dicots but their
              evolutionary relationships  remain unresolved.  Under the direction of faculty
              adviser Dr. Tod  Stuessy at Ohio State University, graduate student Tao Sang is
               conducting extensive field work in both the New and Old Worlds to  amass
              materials for detailed morphological and DNA-based analyses  of the ca. 30
              species in the genus.  New molecular data from  chloroplast DNA and nuclear
              ribosomal DNA promise to yield robust  characters for phylogenetic inference. 
              In turn, a rigorously  grounded phylogeny from morphological and molecular
              evidence will  permit the analysis of intriguing disjunct geographical ranges
              in  the present distribution of peonies in the northern hemisphere.       New
              molecular and morphological evidence will be collected to  study the phylogeny
              and biogeography of Paeonia, a fascinating  group of widely distributed shrubs,
              with ornamental and medicinal  properties.
