Abstract    :
              9321428  Mayewski  This award is for support to provide a high resolution
              paleoenvironmental record of major anions and cations in the Greenland Ice
              Sheet Program Two (GISP2) ice core.  The parameters to be measured include
              choride, nitrate, sulfate, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and ammonium. 
              The high quality, continuous, high resolution multivariate chemical series will
              be combined with mathematical and statistical techniques in order to examine
              the history and understand the causes of climate change.  This work will allow
              the characterization of the fundamental connections among the glaciochemical
              signals and the other parameters measured in the GISP2 core and will permit a
              comparison with other ice core records, instrumental records and other proxy
              records.  This study will also allow for the interpretation of changes in the
              sources and production rates of the chemical species recorded in the GISP2 ice
              and will permit an investigation into the causes of climate change on a variety
              of time scales.  ***
