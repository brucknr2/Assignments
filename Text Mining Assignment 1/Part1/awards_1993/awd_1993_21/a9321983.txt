Abstract    :
              9321983  Tyndall    This Americas Program award will support a collaboration 
              between Timothy Tyndall, Pacific Rim Network (PRN) of Santa  Barbara, CA, and
              the State Distance Learning University  (SDLU) of San Jose, Costa Rica.  The
              mission of the Pacific  Rim Network is to build an electronic bridge linking 
              research and development resources in the sciences,  technologies, education
              and business fields on countries  around the Pacific basin.  Working towards
              that goal, the  immediate objective of this proposal is to establish the 
              initial cooperative international site in Costa Rica, with  the SDLU serving as
              a Central American Hub.    The long-term significance of the Pacific Rim
              Network will  be to assist undeveloped regional areas in the attainment of 
              global networking self-sufficiency, and to improve the  overall Pacific Rim
              economy by promoting transnational  information and communication sharing
              unhindered by  geographic or cultural barriers. As a result, the level of 
              scientific knowledge and technological proficiency in  participating countries
              will improve.  ***
