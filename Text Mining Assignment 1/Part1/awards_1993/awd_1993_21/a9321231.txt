Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and   Facilities Program
              will help the Department of Chemistry at   Montana State University upgrade its
              x-ray diffraction laboratory.    Major projects supported by acquisition of
              this equipment will   include:  Organic Synthesis; Organometallic
              Transformations of   Organic Systems; Preferred Structures of Non-Rigid
              Molecules;   Rare Earth Doped Crystals for Laser Materials;   Characterizations
              of Bioactive Metabolites from Plant Microbes; Polynues;   Polynuclear Bridged
              Mixed Valence Platinum Compounds.    Single crystal x-ray crystallography is
              the most powerful   analytical method for structure determination of solids. 
              In   synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic   chemistry,
              single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable   tool to characterize
              molecular structure.  The information   gained from the knowledge of the
              molecular composition and   structure helps to develop new reactions of
              potentially general intereral   interest in catalysis or synthesis.
