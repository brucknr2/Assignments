Abstract    :
              9321852  SPOHN  The issue of whether racial discrimination occurs in criminal 
              sentencing has not yet been resolved.  Some studies have found  that blacks are
              sentenced more harshly than whites, but others  have found either that there
              are no differences or that blacks  are sentenced more leniently than whites. 
              Critics of this  research have suggested that these inconsistent findings
              reflect  an overly simplistic view of the relationship between race and 
              sentencing.  They have called for research designed to delineate  more
              precisely the conditions under which defendants' race  influences judges'
              sentencing decisions.  The proposed research  responds to this call for
              substantive and methodological  improvements in research on race and
              sentencing.    The PIs will conduct a multi-site study that (1) probes for 
              indirect as well as direct racial effects; (2) tests for  interactions between
              defendants' race, legal and extralegal  variables, and sentencing severity; (3)
              examines decisions made  prior to sentencing for evidence of racial bias; and
              (4) employs  qualitative as well as quantitative techniques.  They will 
              collect detailed data on defendant, victim and case  characteristics for a
              random sample of defendants convicted of  felonies in Cook County (Chicago)
              Circuit Court, Harris County  (Houston) District Court, and Douglas County
              (Omaha) District  Court.  In addition, interviews will be conducted with
              criminal  justice officials in each jurisdiction.    ***
