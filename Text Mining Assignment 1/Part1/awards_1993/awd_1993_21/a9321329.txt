Abstract    :
              9321329  Weisheit       The program focuses on a variety of atomic processes
              related  to ionization and recombination events in plasmas.  Emphasis is 
              placed on phenomena that occur in dense plasma environments, high  magnetic
              fields or intense radiation.  The research is relevant  to a better
              understanding of laboratory and cosmic plasmas, X-ray  lasers, quasars, stellar
              atmospheres and certain fusion  experiments.  ***
