Abstract    :
              9321986  Longo  This proposal is a request for support of a continuing program
              of  research in high energy physics which includes a test of the MAX  detector
              at Fermilab (T864); analysis and publication of data  from previous experiments
              at Fermilab (E683), E756, E800); and a  search for magnetic monopoles trapped
              in matter.  T864 is a test  for a detector that proposes to look in the very
              forward regions  of the highest energy collisions for unusual states of the
              'quark  gluon condensate'.  Hints of events in which all neutral states  that
              appear as large gaps in the rapidity distributions have been  reported in
              cosmic rays.  ***
