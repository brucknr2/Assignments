Abstract    :
              9321423  Schwartz    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for six
              undergraduate  students to conduct research on interface properties of
              advanced,  fiber-reinforced composites.  The research projects include 
              viscoelastic effects on interfacial shear stress in single fiber  composites,
              the effect of plasma surface treatment of graphite  fibers on torsional fatigue
              in composite strands, interfacial  shear strength measurement in
              environmentally friendly (e.g.,  "green") composites, and functional finishes
              for enhancing fiber-  matrix adhesion in arimid/epoxy composites.  %%%  The
              objectives of this program are (1) to enhance the  undergraduate experience,
              especially of students from four-year  colleges, by meaningful, hands-on
              research involvement promoting  independent thinking; (2) to attract potential
              U.S. graduate  students interested in fundamental research in fiber science, 
              with special emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities;  and (3) to
              motivate students to consider research careers in  academia, industry or
              government.  Students will work directly in  faculty research groups, and
              weekly research seminars will be  scheduled in which currently enrolled
              graduate students will  present in-progress results of thesis research.  At the
              end of  the ten week program, REU Site students will present their  research
              results in a university-wide forum, along with students  in similar programs in
              other colleges, at Cornell University.  It  is expected that these projects
              will contribute to publications  in major refereed journals, and will be
              co-authored by REU Site  students.
