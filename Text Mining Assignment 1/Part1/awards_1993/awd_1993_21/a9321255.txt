Abstract    :
              This research is on test paradigms for high-frequency, linear and  nonlinear
              mixed signal circuits and systems.  Issues in BIST  (Built-In Self-Test) and
              design for testability are being  addressed.  Fault models for hard faults
              (open or short circuits)  and for soft faults (deviations from nominal
              component values) are  being developed.  For BIST design, a high speed, low
              power, current  mode copier is employed as the sample/hold circuit to achieve
              10  ns/sample at 0.1% accuracy under 3.3V power supply.  Both CMOS and  BiCMOS
              technology are being used.  Design for testability work  focuses on properly
              selecting component values and topological  structure to increase testability
              and diagnosability.  The problem  of determining component values is formulated
              as an optimization  problem which includes testability strategy as a parameter.
               The  new methods are being tested on realistic circuits.
