Abstract    :
              9321741  POE    Assessing the frequency of occurrence of repression or state 
              terrorism within the world's sovereign states is an important,  difficult, and
              controversial task.  Yet, despite increased  worldwide interest in human rights
              and the regular publication of  profiles of national human rights situations,
              we still require  more systematic knowledge as to why regimes resort to
              repression.   This investigation seeks to develop a theory explaining why 
              regimes use state terrorism against citizens, to develop the data  necessary to
              test that theory, and to analyze the applicability  of that theory to the
              repression record of the world's nations  during the last two decades.  The
              theory will include the factors  previous research has linked to the use of
              state terrorism, but  it will also include new possible causes of repression
              not yet  analyzed using empirical data.  The investigators will test the 
              applicability of the theory for (1) the entire global sample, (2)  different
              regions and time frames, in order to judge whether the  determinants of
              repression vary across time, or differ depending  on the region of the world
              one examines.  This should allow the  researchers to develop better "causal"
              models of repression that  take into account both the direct and indirect
              effects of the  factors they find to be important in their earlier analyses.  
              When these analyses are completed, the investigators plan to work  toward a
              global human rights monitoring system based on a broad  base of empirical
              information and designed to help them foresee  positive and negative national
              trends in repression.   ***
