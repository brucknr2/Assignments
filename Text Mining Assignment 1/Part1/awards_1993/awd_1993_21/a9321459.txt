Abstract    :
              9321459  Wilkins  UC-Riverside  Dr. Charles L. Wilkins and other members of the
              Chemistry Department of the University of  California at Riverside are being
              funded for a  Research  Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)  site in
              Chemistry.  For the period 1994-6 , ten undergraduate students will spend ten
              weeks each  summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.  A
              unique feature of this program  will be the focus on bioanalytical an
              environmental analytical chemistry.
