Abstract    :
              9321913  Oka       This work continues the success efforts to observe and 
              analyze their strong infrared emissions of H3+ in planetary  ionospheres and
              possibly in supernova 1987A. The effort will be  continued to find the H3+
              spectrum in other astronomical objects,  especially in molecular clouds. The
              experimental and theoretical  studies will be attempted using hot laboratory
              plasmas and new  near infrared lasers along with midinfrared laser sources. Two
               new discharge cells will be used to identify novel spectra of  molecular ions.
              A determined effort will be made to identify  spectra of protonated methane and
              oxygen using a hollow cathode  discharge cell in a magnetic field. Furthermore,
              a new method of  ion spectroscopy will be introduced using ionized cryogenic 
              solids instead of hot plasmas. Gamma rays from 60Co will be used  to ionize
              para-hydrogen crystals to form atoms and ion clusters.  A Fourier transform
              spectrometer and possibly laser spectrometer  will be used to observe their
              infrared spectra. If successful,  the method will be extended to other cluster
              ions by introducing  other molecules in crystals as impurities.  ***
