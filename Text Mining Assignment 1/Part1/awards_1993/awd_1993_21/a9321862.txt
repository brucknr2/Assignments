Abstract    :
                9321862  Gurr    Since the end of the Cold War researchers and officials
              concerned  with humanitarian crises have called for development of early 
              warning systems to assist in planning for preventive diplomacy,  humanitarian
              assistance and peace-keeping.  But no one has yet  developed or tested models
              that can be used to analyze how  communal or other conflicts escalate into
              crises and violence.   This research develops a social scientific basis for
              doing so,  using results of the investigator's Minorities at Risk Project.   
              Three high-priority tasks for further research are being carried  out in this
              project:    1)  Updating the Minorities at Risk data set with new and more 
              precise information on about 280 politically-active communal  groups for
              1990-1993, including about 50 newly active groups not  included in the earlier
              study.    2)  Using the data to reestimate models of the cause s of  Communal
              Conflict in the 1980s and early 1990s, including new  measures of state
              coercion and international support, and  improved indicators of group
              mobilization.  These models will be  used to generate short-term forecasts or
              risk assessments about  which groups are likely to become involved in
              escalating  conflict.    3)  Identifying the conditions under which communal
              conflicts  lead to gross human rights violations.  This will be done by (1) 
              specifying a model of the causes of coercive regime responses to  communal
              challenges, and (2) testing it using data on three cases  of protracted
              conflict over a fifteen year period.  ***
