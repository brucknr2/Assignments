Abstract    :
              9321833  Dickison       Under the direction of faculty adviser Dr. William
              Dickison at  the University of North Carolina, graduate student Kenneth Cameron
               is conducting field work in South America and in the Far East to  collect
              materials of the orchid groups related to the genus  Vanilla.  Morphological
              and molecular analyses will then yield new  characters for comparative studies
              aimed at improving taxonomic  recognition of species and genera and for
              inferring phylogenetic  relationships among these plants.  New molecular data
              from  chloroplast DNA and from nuclear ribosomal DNA are likely to  provide
              strong hypotheses of evolutionary relationships.  In turn,  knowledge of the
              evolutionary patterns in these orchid groups will  help assess trends of
              evolutionary change in pollen and seeds,  which are distinctive in many of the
              vanilloid orchids.       The vanilloid orchids include the commercially
              important genus  Vanilla as well as several presumably derived genera that have
              lost  photosynthetic capabilities and exist as mycotrophic parasites,  feeding
              on soil fungi on the roots of tropical forest trees.  This  combined
              morphological and molecular study will help improve our  understanding of the
              evolution of these novel plant adaptations.
