Abstract    :
                9321150  Skitka  Should the government insure people who choose to live in
              high-risk areas such as in flood plains or near fault lines?  When is
              government assistance perceived to be humanitarian versus foolhardy by the
              public who ultimately pays for it?  Using the framework provided by the
              Contingency Model of Distributed Justice (Skitka & Tetlock, 1992). the author
              will explore willingness to provide help to victims of the Midwest floods of
              1993 as a function of whether the affected communities or individuals took
              measures to protect themselves (e.g., used community tax dollars to build
              levees, or as individuals purchased flood insurance).  A random-digit-dialed
              telephone survey of 1,000 adult members of households in the continental United
              States is proposed.  It is predicted that people will be willing to provide
              immediate humanitarian assistance, but willingness to help rebuild will vary as
              a function of perceived health of the U.S. economy, attributions of
              responsibility, and political orientation of the respondent.  ***
