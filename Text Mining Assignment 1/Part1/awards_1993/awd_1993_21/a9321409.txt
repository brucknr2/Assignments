Abstract    :
              9321409  KNOX  This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the 
              research vessels MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON, and R. G. SPROUL, operated  by the
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and dedicated to use in  support of ocean
              science research.    The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct  of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such 
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data 
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Robert Knox is fully qualified to
              direct  this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the 
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.    This project will allow
              the institution to modify the CTD winch,  and replace a searchlight, radar,
              fathometer, water evaporator and  outboard motor on the SPROUL; acquire P-code
              GPSs and replace fire  fighting suits on all three ships; and upgrade self
              contained  breathing devices on the MELVILLE.  ***
