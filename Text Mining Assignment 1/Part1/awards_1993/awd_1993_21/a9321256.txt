Abstract    :
              9321256  Posner  The focus of this research is the use of porous solids such as 
              silica ghel to catalyze 2 + 4 cycloadditions.  The methodology  will be used to
              promote asymmetric inverse electron demand  versions involving
              2-pyrone-3-carboxylate esters and  2-pyridones.  The resulting cyclohexene
              derivatives give the  promise of becoming versatile synthetic intermediates and
              have  the added advantage of being produced by environmentally benign 
              methodology.    With this award from the Chemically Benign Synthesis and 
              Processing Program, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research
              of Dr. Gary H. Posner of the Department of  Chemistry at Johns Hopkins
              University.  Dr. Posner, in  collaboration with W.R. Grace & Co., will focus
              his efforts on  using inexpensive, readily available, and environmentally safe 
              porous solids to catalyze cycloaddition reactions that could  lead to
              industrially important intermediates for the production  of high-value
              pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.  ***
