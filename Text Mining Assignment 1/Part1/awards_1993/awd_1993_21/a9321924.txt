Abstract    :
              Fisch  This research focusses on experimental investigations of strongly 
              interacting self-assembled systems.  Static and dynamic light  scattering
              techniques will be used, at atmospheric pressure and  at high pressures, to
              study the physical properties of semidilute  and concentrated bulk surfactant
              solutions. We intend to  investigate a wide variety of systems including
              zwitterionic  surfactant solutions, mixed surfactant solutions and solutions 
              that contain either rod-like or tubular micelles. The two  dimensional phase
              behavior of tubular aggregates on the surface  or an isotropic fluid will be
              studied both optically and through  direct physical measurements. Studies of
              model systems that  consist of small particles on a vibrating table will
              complement  these measurements. Overall, this program will provide essential 
              thermodynamic information and an improved microscopic  understanding of bulk
              semidilute and concentrated micellar  solutions and new insights and model
              systems for understanding  phase transitions in two dimensions.  %%%  The
              objectives of this research are: 1) to obtain a better  understanding of the
              properties of semidilute and concentrated  self-assembled systems by using
              optical and physical chemical  techniques; 2) to study the properties of these
              solutions when  the self-assembled aggregates form a 3-d solution and when they
               are confined to the surface of an isotropic fluid, thus forming a  2-d nematic
              phase. Overall, this program will provide essential  thermodynamic information
              and an improved microscopic  understanding of bulk semidilute and concentrated
              micellar  solutions and new insights and model systems for understanding  phase
              transitions in two dimensions.
