Abstract    :
              9321417  Shklovskii  This theoretical project will build a qualitative theory of
              the  quantum Hall effect including such characteristics as the widths of  the
              diagonal conductivity peaks and the depths of the corresponding  minima.  The
              basis for this work is the generally accepted idea  that the localization
              length diverges only at some isolated values  of the filling factor.  Thus, at
              almost all other filling factors  the low temperature conductivity is
              determined by hopping.  In the  present work the steps of the Hall conductivity
              will be studied.   The hopping corrections to the quantized values at the
              plateaus  will be calculated.  The prefactor of the hopping conductivity, 
              which is necessary for an understanding of the universal shapes and  heights of
              the peaks, will be investigated.  This approach will be  extended to the
              fractional quantum Hall effect including a theory  of hopping transport of
              fractional excitations.  %%%  The theoretical research will study the
              properties of the two-  dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong
              magnetic field  - a subject for which the Nobel prize was awarded a number of
              years  ago.  This Quantum Hall Effect has presented physicists with an 
              exciting new state of matter which is not yet fully understood.   The present
              research will explore a number of properties of the  Quantum Hall Effect by
              taking a different approach (hopping  conductivity) than others and for which
              the principal investigator  is an international expert.  ***
