Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-21466    The PI's request funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V WEATHERBIRD II, a 115 foot vessel, which is owned and
              operated by the Station.  Instrumentation requested includes  computer
              hardware, an environmental data collection system, a liquid scintillation
              counter and a reagent grade water system.  The instrumentation requested is
              required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the WEATHERBIRD II during
              1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
