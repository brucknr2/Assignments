Abstract    :
                Proposal #: 93-21540    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V CAPE HATTERAS, a 135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and
              operated by the University.  Instrumentation requested includes computer
              hardware for the shipboard computer, 10 liter and 30 liter Niskin bottles, an
              upgrade for the CTD, an underwater video camera, and an air compressor for
              seismic studies.  The instrumentation requested is required for support of
              NSF-funded cruises aboard the CAPE HATTERAS during 1994 and will enhance the
              scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
