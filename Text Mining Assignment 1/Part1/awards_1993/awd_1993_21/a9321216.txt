Abstract    :
              Interacting random systems (some of which are known as random  cellular
              automata) are random processes which describe the  collective behavior of many
              components, placed in a d-dimensional  discrete space and interacting with each
              other in a discrete or  continuous time.  This research will further develop
              the method  of branching contours in order to examine the asymptotic behavior 
              of interacting random systems, in which the set of states of a  single
              component is infinite (a line, a circle).  Computer  simulation of interacting
              random systems will be used as a  preliminary step for obtaining rigorous
              results.  Interacting random systems (some of which are known as random 
              cellular automata) are now often used now to simulate the  behavior and
              properties of those real objects whose  multi-component structure cannot be
              ignored.  They are used  extensively in mathematical modeling of physical,
              chemical,  biological and other systems.  The importance of interacting  random
              systems is widely acknowledged.  Computer simulations of  various kinds of
              interacting systems now abound around the world,  but rigorous results in this
              area are not so rich as in older  branches of mathematics, because
              straightforward application of  traditional mathematical methods brings only
              limited success in  this new field.  This research will investigate the
              mathematical  properties of interacting random systems, especially their 
              qualitative and asymptotic behavior using both classical methods  from
              different areas of mathematics and those newly developed.
