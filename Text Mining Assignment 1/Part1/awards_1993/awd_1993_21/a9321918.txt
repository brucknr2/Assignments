Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9321918  Bejan     The proposed research focuses on the
              determination of the optimal on/off sequence for defrosting refrigerators, in
              an effort to minimize the power requirement.  The results will include the
              optimal time intervals of continuous operation and defrosting, and the optimal
              way to divide a fixed amount of heat exchanger area between the evaporator and
              the condenser.  It is also proposed to optimize the ice making process by
              optimally selecting the on/off sequence of operation, i.e., the time intervals
              for freezing and ice removal.  Two manufacturing methods will be optimized, ice
              on tube and ice in tube.  The work will be performed analytically, numerically,
              and experimentally.
