Abstract    :
              9321100  Gubbins    Partial support is sought for invited speakers from the
              United  States to attend the Fourth Liblice Conference on the  Statistical
              Mechanics of Liquids, to be held at Lake Milovy,  Czech Republic on June 6-10,
              1994.  The Czech Academy of  Sciences is organizing and hosting the conference,
              and will  cover all local costs within the Czech Republic.  Unique  features of
              the conference will include:  (a) coverage of the  most recent molecular
              methods and results for complex liquids  and interfaces, including ionic and
              associated liquids, colloids  and micellar solutions, self-assembly, aqueous
              solutions,  surfactants and adsorbents, etc., (b) latest developments in 
              advanced molecular simulation techniques, including parallel and  distributed
              systems, (c) coverage of both applied and basic  aspects, and (d) an
              opportunity for U.S. researchers to become  familiar with leading research in
              this area by groups from East  and West Europe, Japan and Australia.  The
              invited speakers will  include many of the international experts from these
              countries.   Previous conferences were held in 1983, 1986, and 1990, and 
              received widespread acclaim from U.S. attendees.  ***
