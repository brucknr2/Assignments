Abstract    :
              9321896  Covert  The fungus Cronartium quercuum fusiforme causes fusiform rust
              in Southern pines.  The  fungus must grow in association with two different
              host trees, pine and oak, in order to  complete its life cycle.  This starter
              grant, based on Dr. Covert's NSF Plant Postdoctoral  Fellowship, is funding
              research aimed at the identification of genes involved with the  cause of galls
              on pines and the specificity of different spore forms for different hosts.  A 
              collection of genes from the fungus is being made, and techniques are being
              developed  to genetically transform the fungus.    %%%  Fusiform rust is the
              most economically significant tree disease in the Southern United  States. 
              These experiments will allow the techniques of molecular biology to be applied 
              to studies of how this fungus causes disease and how it propagates itself.
