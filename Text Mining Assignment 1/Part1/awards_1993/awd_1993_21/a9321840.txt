Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-21840    The PIx requests funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in  support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used  aboard the R/V THOMPSON, a 274 foot vessel, which is owned by the  Navy
              and operated by the University.  Instrumentation funded  includes fiber optic
              hubs for the computer network, a CTD  underwater unit, a 24-position rosette
              pylon, a thermosalinograph,  a Swath mapping workstation, and two altimeters. 
              The  instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-funded  cruises
              aboard the R/V THOMPSON during 1994 and will enhance the  scientific capability
              of the vessel in the future.
