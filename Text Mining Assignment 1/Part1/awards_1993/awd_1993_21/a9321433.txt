Abstract    :
              9321433  Stochaj    The objective of this Research Fellowship in Marine 
              biotechnology is to apply molecular techniques to the  investigation of
              interactions between host and endosymbiont  in a cnidarian/algal symbiosis. 
              Using the Aiptasia  pallida/Symbiodinium sp. symbiosis, this project will 
              examine interactions between the alga and the host at the  levels of controlled
              protein and RNA synthesis.  The project  represents  an interdisciplinary
              approach to further our  knowledge on interactions in cnidarian/algal
              symbioses.  Current physiological and biochemical knowledge suggests  that the
              host regulates growth, release of metabolites and  possibly the metabolism of
              the algal endosymbiont. The  interaction between the host and symbiont on the
              molecular  level will be examined on the molecular level in order to 
              understand what causes the physiological changes noted in  the algal
              endosymbiont and how the host may be involved in  regulating these changes.
