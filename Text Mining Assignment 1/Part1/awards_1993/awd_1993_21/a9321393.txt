Abstract    :
                9321393  Cruickshank    A Gordon Conference on the Chemistry of Electronic
              Materials  is  being held to address current topics in the chemistry of 
              synthesis, processing and use of semiconductors, dielectrics  and  metals in a
              wide variety of potential areas in the field of  electronics/photonics with a
              strong emphasis on fundamental  atomic level processes. Particular focus will
              be on critical  chemical issues in nanoscale technology.  Additionally there 
              will  be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties  between
              universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is  expected that top
              scientists in the field will attend, and  that  the Conference will provide an
              effective forum to discuss  and  delineate the critical scientific issues in
              this research  area,  and to consider and define the approaches and techniques 
              needed  to address them. Understanding and controlling processes at  the 
              atomic level are becoming increasingly important for  electronic  and photonic
              materials.  %%%   An evaluation of the status of Chemistry of Electronic 
              Materials, and especially the critical chemical issues in  nanoscale
              technology, and recommendations by the Conference  participants for the
              emphasis of future work, and their  assessment of the most important
              contemporary research  issues  will be of great value to the understanding and
              enhanced  utilization of chemical methodology in the field of 
              microelectronics.  ***
