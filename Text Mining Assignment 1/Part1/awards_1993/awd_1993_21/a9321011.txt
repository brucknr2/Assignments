Abstract    :
               This research project seeks to develop a new class of manufacturing
              decision-making methods based on machine learning, which refers to
              computational systems for deriving knowledge, strategies, or decision
              structures from such information as performance data, observations, or past
              experiences.   The proposed methodology will provide a framework for
              intelligent, adaptive manufacturing decision making with learning capabilities.
               It will also incorporate a general model for automating manufacturing decision
              support that is capable of progressive performance improvements.   Besides the
              development and analysis of the learning-based manufacturing decision
              methodology, the research plan also includes the validation of the methodology
              by simulation experiments and by testing it in real-world manufacturing
              environments.
