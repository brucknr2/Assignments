Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses three areas in the foundations of  quantum mechanics. 
              The first deals with coherence and  interference in processes involving three
              or more particles,  and builds upon previous examples for two particles.  The 
              second deals with aspects of non-locality for spatially  separated particles. 
              The third concerns the study of  stochastic variants of dynamics in quantum
              mechanics.  ***
