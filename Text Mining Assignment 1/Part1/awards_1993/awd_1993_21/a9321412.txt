Abstract    :
              9321412  JACKSON  One of the central concerns of urban planning is to direct and
               control private investment into communities, in part through  zoning and
              land-use regulations.  Public land planning, along  with federal housing
              programs such as government mortgage  insurance, increased the homeownership
              rate and helped create  middle class American suburbs, but they did not prevent
              and may  have exacerbated the decline of many inner-city areas.  This  proposal
              seeks to describe the impact of urban planning efforts  on private mortgage
              lending practices in inner-cities.    The project will examine inner-city
              community development lending  by private financial institutions since the
              urban riots of the  1960s.  It will use six case studies to address two
              questions: 1)  how can financial institutions change economic and social 
              conditions in low- and moderate-income urban neighborhoods?, and  2) what are
              the implications for urban planning, public policy,  and theories about the
              growth and decline of cities and  neighborhoods?  The PI will review both
              relevant public documents  and financial and and economic data on specific
              residential,  commercial real estate and business projects, in addition to 
              conducting interviews with those involved in urban planning in  these areas.
