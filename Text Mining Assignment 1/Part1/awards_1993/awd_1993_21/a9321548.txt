Abstract    :
              9321548  BUSS  The webs woven by orb-web spiders can be viewed as silken lines
              that record a series of spider movements.  Thus webs, which persist, have been
              a classic system for studies of behavior and the inheritance of particular
              patterns of web weaving.  However, a controversy still exists about whether all
              the orb-weavers are related in a single lineage or whether there are two
              lineages exhibiting this basic behavior with numerous modifications and losses
              within each.  This project will use DNA sequencing to address the relationships
              of orb-web spiders that have previously been based solely on morphological and
              behavioral evidence.  The resulting molecular based phylogeny or pattern of
              relationships can then be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin and
              diversification of web design.  %%%  Knowledge of spider relationships may be
              clarified by this project.  This information can be of value in conservation of
              biodiversity as well as in designing programs for natural control of pest
              insects with diminished use of pesticides.  ***
