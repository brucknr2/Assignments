Abstract    :
              9321461  Caporael  Most behavioral, social and biological science theories use 
              individuals as the basic unit of analysis and assume these units to  be more or
              less rationally self-interested.  The objective of Dr.  Caporael in this
              research is to challenge the adequacy of that  focus and assumption.  She is
              developing an hypothesis that humans  are adapted for small group living,
              resulting in adaptive  specializations for sociality that can be and have been
              extended  for constructing, identifying and solving problems in novel  domains.
               These domains include those associated with large-scale  social organization
              and nonsocial objects.  This perspective  predicts a tension between social
              construction of knowledge, which  facilitates coordination within groups, and
              the negotiation of the  habitat, which requires some correspondence with
              reality.  In this  research, Dr. Caporael is synthesizing theory and data in 
              evolutionary biology, psychology, and anthropology to develop a  general theory
              of sociality drawing on evidence for correspondences  between group
              configuration and psychological functioning.   Sociality theory provides a
              plausible reinterpretation of  traditional topics in human evolution, as well
              as a plausible  interpretation for folk psychology and evolutionary folk 
              psychology.  Dr. Caporael is also applying the theory to familiar  topics (the
              Turing test, technological innovation, and scientific  organization) in
              Science, Technology and Society (STS) research.   The results of this study
              should be of great interest to  psychologists, evolutionary scientists and STS
              researchers.  ***
