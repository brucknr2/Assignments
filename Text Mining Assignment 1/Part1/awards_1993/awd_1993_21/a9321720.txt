Abstract    :
               Mayaguez  Gustavo Lopez is supported by a Minority Research Initiation Research
                Planning grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program   to
              study the behavior of clusters adsorbed on surfaces.  Computer   simulations
              will be used to study the structural and thermodynamic   properties of various
              clusters adsorbed on model surfaces as a function   of temperature and cluster
              size.   Examination of free energies as a   function of cluster size will be
              used to determine whether "magic number"   clusters are to be expected. 
              Characterization of phase transitions will   be investigated by looking for
              heat capacity discontinuities as a   function of temperature.    Heterogeneous
              catalysis is a very important industrial process which   involves reactions of
              chemicals adsorbed on a catalytic surface.  A   number of physical processes
              are involved such as sticking probabilities,   surface diffusion and mobility,
              interaction of the adsorbates with the   surface, etc.  Computer simulations of
              clusters adsorbed on model   surfaces provide molecular level insight into
              processes which may have   important industrial catalytic significance.
