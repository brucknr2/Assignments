Abstract    :
              9321325  Manuelli  This project consists of three topics all concerned with the 
              relationship between public policy and economic growth.  The       first
              focuses on the effectiveness of collective choice  mechanisms in implementing
              policies that determine pollution in a  growth context.  At issue is whether or
              not the rising income  associated with the process of development will result
              in more  stringent environmental controls. In the process of analyzing  this
              issue, the consequences of the irreversibility of pollution  effects and the
              impact on the intergenerational distribution of  welfare are analyzed.  A
              related issue is the effect of free  trade both on the overall level of
              pollution, as well as its  allocation across countries.  Specific interest is
              focused on  understanding both the short-run effect of a switch to free trade 
              and the dynamic impact that the development process has on  "pollution trading"
                 The second topic concerns the effects of the design of systems to  protect
              property rights such as patents, copyrights, and trade  secret laws on the
              incentives to innovate and the consequences  for the overall rate of
              development of the economy.  The third  topic analyzes the effect of
              instability on the growth rate of  the economy.  Among the issues to be
              investigated is the impact  of volatile tax and spending policies on the
              average level of  growth through the effect on investment.  ***
