Abstract    :
              9321259  Wise    Technical abstract:  It is proposed to investigate the
              properties  of semiconductor nanocrystals which exhibit strong quantum 
              confinement of electrons, holes and excitons.  Nanocrystals of the 
              semiconducting lead chalcogenides provide unique access to the 
              strong-confinement regime.  The electronic structure, the  vibrational
              properties, and the coupling of the electronic and  vibrational states of these
              nanocrystals will be investigated with  Raman and far-infrared spectroscopies
              as well as continuous wave,  nanosecond and femtosecond optical techniques. 
              This research will  provide detailed information about the importance of
              Coulomb  interactions under conditions of strong confinement of charge 
              carriers.    Non-technical abstract:  Solid structures which confine electrons 
              to dimensions on the order of atomic sized dimensions have  properties which
              differ drastically from those of the corresponding  bulk crystals.  The goal of
              this project is to determine the  electronic and optical properties of
              nanostructures made of the  lead salts (such as lead sulfide), where the
              effects of confinement  should be greater than in most other materials.  The
              unique  features of the lead salts are expected to lead to nonlinear  optical
              properties approximately 1000 times stronger than those of  previously
              investigated nanostructures.  The potential applications  of such strongly
              optically nonlinear materials is in optical  information processing.  ***
