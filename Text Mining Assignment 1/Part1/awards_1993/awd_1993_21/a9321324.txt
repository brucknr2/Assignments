Abstract    :
              9321324  Lesser       Control, the intelligent selection of actions to execute,
              is  critical to the performance of knowledge-based systems such a  planners job
              shop schedulers, and speech understanding systems.   This is particularly true
              for parallel systems in which the  controlling agent has the additional goals
              of maximizing the  utilization of parallel resources.  The proposed research
              studies  the issues of control in parallel knowledge-based systems through  the
              development of a theory of control based o an analysis of task  interactions
              and the influence of the environment.  The theoretical  approach to control
              issues is based on the observation that control  is a knowledge-based on an
              understanding of the interactions  between the problem-solving process, the
              problem domain, and the  specific environment in which a problem-solving
              episode takes  place.  This effort will be an extension of previous efforts to 
              develop a formal model of how the structure of a domain influences  ad
              constrains the choice of methods used to develop solutions  within that domain
              and in developing stochastic models of  environments.  These efforts will be
              extended towards modeling  effects that are particularly significant in
              parallel computations.   Specifically, the nature of task interactions will be
              explored.
