Abstract    :
              9321506  Bekaert  Despite the importance of exchange rate movements in an 
              increasingly integrated world economy, we have not developed  good economic
              models that guide our understanding of the  behavior of exchange rates over
              time. This has lead to a  widespread belief that currency markets are
              inefficient.  This research develops several exchange rate models in an 
              attempt to explain various empirical regularties of exchange  rates without
              having to resort to market inefficiency  arguments. The models assume that
              markets are efficient and  the market participants are rational but risk
              averse.The  empirical part of the study examines how well the models fit 
              actual exchange rate data.       The first model concentrates on high
              variability of  exchange rates and how this variability changes over time.  The
              second model focusses on the predictability of  international asset returns. In
              an extension to this model,  the effect of the credibility of monetary policy
              on asset  markets is examined. The third model examines why, for  example, is
              the dollar amount to buy a comparable basket of  consumption goods in the
              United States versus Japan so  different?  Here, the study explores whether
              non-traded  goods, such as houses, and the existence of a sizable  government
              sector are the main source of the puzzling  behavior of exchange rates and
              consumption prices across  countries.  ***
