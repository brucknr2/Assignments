Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, James Lisy of the University of Illinois will study  
              isolated cation and anion clusters solvated in various solvents using  
              mass-selected tunable infrared spectroscopy.  A triple-quadrupole mass  
              spectrometer will be combined with tunable optical parametric oscillator  
              (OPO) or CO2 laser as the spectroscopic source in the infrared.    Molecular
              dynamics calculations are also planned for comparison with   experiment and to
              suggest new directions.  %%%  Interactions between electrically charged atoms
              or molecules, called   ions, and neutral molecules are of fundamental
              importance to a number of   areas of study, including the study of chemical
              processes going on in the   condensed phase  such as liquid or solid solutions.
               These studies could   thus contribute to understanding ion transport in
              biological systems.    Similarly, examining gas phase ion-molecule processes is
              important for   understanding chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere.
