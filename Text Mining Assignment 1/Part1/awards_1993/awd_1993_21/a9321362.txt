Abstract    :
              9321362  SIMS    The scarcity of black pearl oysters is the single greatest 
              constraint to expansion of this industry. Many Pacific atoll  lagoons are
              suitable for pearl farming, but simply lack the  oysters. The Hawaiian
              subspecies of black pearl oysters  (P.Margaritifera galtsoffi) was once common
              in the islands, but was  heavily overfished for pearl shell.  Only remnants of
              the  population remain. Re-establishment of pearl oyster stocks in  Hawaii
              could lead to a small commercial fishery for pearl shell.     The development
              of a commercial black pearl hatchery using the  local oysters is the necessary
              first step in developing and  implementing pearl culture in Hawaii. This
              research  will assess  the technical and financial feasibility of land-based as
              well as  ocean-based grow-out techniques designed to accommodate conditions 
              found in Hawaii and other S. Pacific Island groups. In addition,  the
              establishment of a quarantine hatchery to produce stock from  other S. Pacific
              Islands, e.g., Christmas Island, could lead to  joint venture farms with these
              various island groups. If  successful, this project would lead to a competitive
              pearl oyster  culture operation and enhance the economic status of the region.
