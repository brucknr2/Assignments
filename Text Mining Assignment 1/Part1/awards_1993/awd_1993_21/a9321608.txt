Abstract    :
              9321608  Heckel  Funding is for two separate experiments.  The first is an 
              experiment to measure the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the  neutron using
              ultracold neutrons stored in a bottle.  A non-zero  neutron EDM would be
              evidence for a breakdown of both Time  Reversal (T) and Parity (P) symmetries. 
              Limits on the neutron  EDM are crucial for determining which theoretical
              explanations  for T symmetry violation are correct.  The goal of the second 
              experiment is to measure the P violating weak interaction between  neutrons and
              helium nuclei.  This information complements other  measurements and will help
              fully parameterized the low energy  nucleon-nucleon weak interaction to provide
              a test of a standard  eletroweak theory.  We plan to measure the
              weak-interaction  induced rotation of the polarization vector of a transversely
               polarized cold neutron beam on propagation through 50 cm of  liquid helium. 
              The effect, expected to be of order 10-7 radians,  represents an unprecedented
              experimental sensitivity.
