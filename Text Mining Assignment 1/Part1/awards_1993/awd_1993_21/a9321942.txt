Abstract    :
              III-9321942  Wu    Consultare Group Incorporated   "A New Sequence Method for
              Low Cost Multiple Access Communications"  This project is funded under the
              National Science Foundation's  (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              program, which is  designed to provide an opportunity for small business,
              particularly  the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.  
              Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising  proposals
              and determine if the firm can do high quality research.   Phase II is the
              principal research project.  Phase III is the  conversion of the NSF-funded
              research into commercial applications  and technological innovation supported
              by follow-on private venture  capital or other non-federal financing.  This
              Phase II project  involves research in three areas related to new sequence
              generation  in multiple access applications:  theoretical, practical and 
              complementary.  The theoretical research plan consists of the  generalization
              of the {D}-sequence minimum distance properties, the  availability of mutually
              orthogonal Latin squares, derivation of  sequence length with respect to
              {D}-set parameters, and the  applicability of general symbol matrix size.  The
              practical  research plan addresses the computer programs to be established for 
              simulation and evaluations of Phase I tasks.  The complementary  research plan
              proposes the derivation and evaluation criteria of  {D}-sequence detection in
              interference environments, the  compatibility of sequence transmission through
              ATM cells, and the  error coding and ciphering problems and solutions for
              {D}-sequences  to be used with multimedia applications.  ***
