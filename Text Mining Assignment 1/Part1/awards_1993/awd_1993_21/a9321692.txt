Abstract    :
              9321692 Mendelssohn Global sea level rise is expected to result in severe
              impacts to coastal ecosystems. However, mechanisms affecting regeneration of
              vegetation following disturbances in low salinity marshes most susceptible to
              impacts are poorly understood. Disturbances that kill plants may result in
              different patterns of regeneration than non-killing disturbances, leading to
              differences in community structure. The objectives of this dissertation
              research are to: (1) examine the ability of vegetation to resist invasion by
              other species when affected by killing or non-killing disturbances, (2)
              investigate the role of salinity and disturbance in species dominance patterns
              in salt marsh vegetation. A series of field and greenhouse experiments will be
              employed.  %%% Detailed knowledge of mechanisms affecting regeneration of
              vegetation is crucial to out ability to predict the responses of plant
              communities in coastal marshes to global sea level rise. This research will
              contribute significantly to the growing body of knowledge regarding the effects
              of sea level rise on coastal wetlands, as well as further understanding of the
              role of changing environmental conditions in plant community dynamics. ***
