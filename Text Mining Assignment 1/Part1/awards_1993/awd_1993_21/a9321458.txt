Abstract    :
              9321458  Full    This project addresses a question of major interest to 
              physiological ecologists: does physiological capacity  reflect performance in
              nature? Precise measurements of  locomotion in nature will test predictions
              based on  laboratory measurements of the energetics underlying  endurance
              capacity in a nocturnal lizard, the banded gecko  (Coleonyx variegatus).
              Nocturnal lizards represent a  substantial evolutionary shift in environment.
              Nocturnality  imposes a thermal handicap, which constrains endurance  capacity
              to submaximal levels. Nocturnal geckos have evolved  excellent fuel economy,
              which partially offsets the thermal  handicap. In this dissertation research
              project, Mr. Autumn  will use infrared video motion analysis to obtain 
              quantitative measurements of frequency, speed, and duration  of locomotion of
              banded geckos in the field. He will test  the hypothesis that natural
              performance loads are limited by  nocturnality, yet exceed the capacity of
              comparable diurnal  lizards. This project will complete a picture that links
              (1)  effects of evolution of environment on physiological  capacity with (2)
              effects of evolution  of physiological  capacity on performance in nature.
