Abstract    :
              9321572  Hanken         This proposal outlines a series of descriptive and 
              experimental studies that examine the hormonal mediation of  embryonic
              development in direct-developing anurans. Precocious  activity of the thyroid
              axis is frequently cited as the mechanism  underlying direct development, but
              this has never been fully  examined. To test this hypothesis, initial
              appearance and  subsequent development of the thyroid axis in a
              direct-developing  frog will be compared to the patterns observed in
              metamorphosing  frogs. The role of thyroid hormones (TH) in mediating direct 
              development will also be evaluated experimentally by manipulating  endogenous
              hormone levels.       Methods include histology (to document thyroid gland and 
              median eminence formation), radioimmunoassay (to determine TH  levels through
              embryonic development), immunocytochemistry (to  examine the ontogeny of
              thyrotropic cells and TH receptor  expression), and hormone manipulation (to
              experimentally examine  the roles of TH in direct development). Analyses will
              focus on  embryos of the direct developing frog Eleutherodactylus coqui 
              (Leptodactylidae) derived from an established breeding colony.  For comparative
              purposes, analyses will also include several  metamorphosing species, including
              Leptodactylus albilabris  (Leptodactylidae), Bombina orientalis
              (Discoglossidae), and  Xenopus laevis (Pipidae).       Results will contribute
              to our understanding of the  endocrine mediation of direct development in
              amphibians. They  also will provide new information on the mechanistic basis 
              underlying life-history evolution. In addition, this study will  examine
              maternal provisioning of hormones in early embryogenesis  and development, a
              process relevant to understanding early  development in all classes of
              vertebrates.  ***
