Abstract    :
                      9321112  SHEEHAN  This archaeological project will recover data on
              prehistoric  and  historic  occupations  at Pingasagruk,  Point  Franklin, 
              once  a  whaling  village  on  Alaska's Chukchi  Sea  coast.  The  rapidly 
              eroding site will provide comparative data on differential access  to  trade 
              and resources in the region, and provide a  background  for  interpreting the
              well-documented aboriginal warfare  of  the  past. In addition to analyzing
              settlement abandonment phases, and  the  hiatus  between the historic and
              prehistoric  settlement  at  Pingasagruk,  poorly documented outlying sites
              will  be  recorded  using  spatial domain radar (SDR). Information on house pit
              reuse  and the vertical and historical extents of middens can be used to 
              refine    population   estimates   and   patterns   of   resource 
              exploitation. The project will be carried out in cooperation with  Wainwright 
              village residents and the North Slope  Borough.  Both  students and elders will
              participate.  ***
