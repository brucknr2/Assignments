Abstract    :
              Many imaging systems use arrays of individual elements to sense the  propagating
              field produced by an object.  Through signal processing  techniques such as
              beamforming, an image of the object may then be  formed.  In addition to such
              passive arrays, imaging systems may  use active arrays to both illuminate an
              object with a radiated  field and to record the reflected field.  Examples of
              imaging array  systems occur in radio astronomy, sonar, microwave imaging and 
              ultrasound imaging.    This research is aimed at developing fundamental new
              results for  array design and associated signal processing, based on recent 
              developments on the characterization of array performance in linear  imaging. 
              Active imaging systems (e.g. ultrasound imaging arrays)  are a particular focus
              of this investigation, although some of the  proposed work also addresses
              passive arrays.  Using the idea of the  "coarray", this work will consider how
              to deploy array elements  (and associated hardware) in the most efficient way
              to obtain large  array apertures and high resolutions.  The results will allow 
              minimum redundancy active arrays and minimum complexity active  arrays to be
              specified.  This research on arrays includes a study  of their characteristics
              under real operating conditions, under  real operating conditions, and will
              extend to some experimental  work with an acoustic array system.
