Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-21732    The PI's request funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V POINT SUR, a 135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and
              operated by the University.  Instrumentation requested includes two dissolved
              oxygen sensors and a fluorometer for use with the CTD and a new printer for use
              with scientific data acquisition aboard the ship.  The instrumentation
              requested is required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the POINT SUR
              during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the
              future.
