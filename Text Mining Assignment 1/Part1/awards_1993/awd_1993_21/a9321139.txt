Abstract    :
              9321139  Scott  Theoretical studies of low pressure diamond film growth by
              chemical  vapor deposition and combustion methods will be undertaken.  The 
              project has two parts.  In the first part investigations of  individual
              chemical reactions involving gas phase hydrogen,  acetylene and associated
              radical with the diamond surface will be  done.  These studies will be done
              using molecular dynamics and  trajectory methods.  The reaction rate constants
              and probabilities  will feed into the second part of the project - kinetic
              Monte Carlo  simulation of the film deposition process.  These results will be 
              compared to ongoing experimental work.  %%%  This multidisciplinary project
              between chemistry and physics aims  at developing a better understanding of the
              growth of diamond  films.  These films are of great current interest since
              diamond is  the hardest known material and has other unique properties. 
              Interest in these materials has evolved rapidly since an  inexpensive method
              was discovered to produce these materials.  The  present project will determine
              the most likely chemical reactions  for the gas-phase precursors for diamond
              deposition and then use  these to simulate film growth.  Results will be
              compared to  experiments.  ***
