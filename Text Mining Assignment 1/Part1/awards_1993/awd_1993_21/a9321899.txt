Abstract    :
              9321899  Rabalais  This research project, which is focussed on the development
              of  a new method for the structural analysis of solid surfaces, is  supported
              by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Scattering and Recoiling
              Imaging Spectrometry (SARIS) will be  developed as a method for providing
              structural information  about solid surfaces on a time scale consistent with
              some  important dynamic processes.  This method is based on the  shadow cone
              techniques previously developed in the Rabalais  laboratory, and the primary
              goal of the research project is the  design and construction of an instrument
              which can be used for  SARIS studies.  The technique will then be applied to a
              number  of important thin film growth and surface reaction processes,  with
              impact on the understanding of electronic materials  chemistry.  %%%  The
              ability to obtain surface structural information on a time  scale compatible
              with electronic device growth and processing  is a crucial ability for the
              semiconductor industry.  The  results of this research project will enable the
              development of  analytical instrumenation and methodology which will address 
              this need.  ***
