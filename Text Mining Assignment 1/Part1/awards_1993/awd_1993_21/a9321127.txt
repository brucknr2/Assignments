Abstract    :
              9321127  Naik    Technical abstract:  The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) method
              will  be used to probe the magnetic anisotropies of epitaxial magnetic 
              multilayered films.  <100> oriented Ni-Cu and Co-Cu superlattices  will be
              grown using a molecular beam deposition system on a Cu  (100) seed layer
              deposited on hydrogen terminated Si (100)  substrates.  Reflection high energy
              electron diffraction and x-ray  diffraction studies will be used to determine
              the preferred  orientation, strains and periodicity of the superlattice.  
              Evolution of FMR as a function of the number of periods and also as  a function
              of the thickness of the magnetic and nonmagnetic layers  will be studied to
              seek an insight into the origin of multiple  resonances observed in the
              multilayered structures.    Non-technical abstract:  There is much interest in
              the growth and  study of magnetic multilayered films due to their potential for
               application in magnetic recording and reading (conventional and 
              magneto-optic) and also in sensor devices (magnetoresistive and 
              magnetostrictive).  Magnetic multilayered structures provide more  freedom to
              tailor desirable magnetic properties.  The proposed  research deals with the
              fabrication of single crystal magnetic  multilayers of Ni-Cu and Co-Cu and
              study of their magnetic  properties.  Magnetic properties of the superlattices
              will be  studied as function of the thickness of the magnetic and  nonmagnetic
              layers as well as the number of their repetitions.  ***
