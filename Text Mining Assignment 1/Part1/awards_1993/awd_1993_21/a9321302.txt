Abstract    :
              This research explores adaptive methods for high performance, lossy  signal
              compression, and in particular, focuses on a variety of  methods that rely on
              signal expansions.  Among these are: (1)  signal adaptive expansions that
              include quantization and entropy  coding.  These are generalizations of
              transform or subband/wavelet  and wavelet packet schemes.  In particular,
              adaptive wavelet  packets are being studied, both from the point of a view of 
              constructing bases and that of finding good and efficient  algorithms to find
              the best bases.  (2) Overcomplete expansions or  frames.  The focus is on
              quantization performance and computational  complexity.  (3) The class of
              compression algorithms that use  successive approximation.  A rage-distortion
              version of matching  pursuit is being developed; generalizations of
              hierarchical methods  based on wavelets and wavelet packers are being
              investigated.  (4)  Adaptive schemes for compression, including adaptive
              transforms and  quantization.  Goals include a lossy equivalent of arithmetic 
              coding, and a lossy dictionary based predictive compression scheme  that
              resembles a lossy Lempel-Ziv algorithm.
