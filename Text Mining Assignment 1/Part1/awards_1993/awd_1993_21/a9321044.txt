Abstract    :
              9321044  Manski  For almost 50 years, national consumer surveys have elicited 
              subjective reports of economic expectations.  Although consumer  confidence
              indexes are widely employed as leading indicators of  aggregate economic
              activity, subjective expectations data are not  looked upon favorably by most
              economic researchers.  The  rejection of these data can be partially attributed
              to the  qualitative nature of the survey questions.  The purpose of this 
              project is to collect and analyze quantitative expectations data  in order to
              open up new avenues of research on consumer behavior  under uncertainty.  The
              new survey questions were included in a  national telephone survey of 617
              households.  Preliminary data  analysis and interviewer comments suggest that
              respondents  willingly provide sensible responses to these questions.  These 
              households will be re-interviewed and their responses will be  analyzed to
              assess the predictive value of this information.   This project is important
              because it will provide new data on the  process of expectation formation and
              the predictive content of  these forecasts.  ***
