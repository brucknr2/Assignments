Abstract    :
              9321262  Yau,S. S-T       The research entails several problems in
              complex-analytic  geometry. One problem relates to the topology and
              combinatorial  aspects of certain linear configurations in complex projective 
              spaces. This research has applications to algebraic geometry and  number
              theory. Another topic involves studying the invariants of  the embedding
              problem for CR-manifolds.  ***
