Abstract    :
              9321839  Dwoskin  This action if for continued partial support of the National 
              Academy of Sciences/ National Research Council Committee on  Seismology.    The
              activities of the Committee on Seismology consist of : (1)  conducting two
              meetings of the committee each year; (2) convening  a panel and conducting a
              workshop to develop a plan for handling  strong motion data; (3) convening a
              panel to review the  methodology of deriving probabilistic earthquake
              estimates; (4)  convening a workshop to address high-performance computing
              needs  in seismology; and (5) initiating a review of the science of 
              seismology.  ***
