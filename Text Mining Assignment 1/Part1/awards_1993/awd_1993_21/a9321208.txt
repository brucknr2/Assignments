Abstract    :
              This grant, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program of the   Chemistry
              Division, supports the work of Professor Fred Lytle on the   development of
              two-photon fluorescence spectroscopy for analytical   microbiological
              applications.  Several avenues of research are being   pursued, including
              instrumentation developments to enhance two photon   fluorescence detection
              limits, characterization of two-photon   fluorophors, microbiological
              applications involving the identification of   bacteria, and the
              characterization of enzyme release from cells.  Two   photon fluorescence
              methods allow essentially background-free   measurements to be made on complex
              biological samples.    This work involves the use of laser induced fluorescence
              to detect small   concentrations of chemically tagged molecules in biological
              samples.  The   two photon spectroscopic technique developed in this work will
              allow the   targeted molecules to be detected without interference from the
              myriad of   other species present in biological specimens.  This work has  
              implications for a broad range of biotechnology research and   applications.
