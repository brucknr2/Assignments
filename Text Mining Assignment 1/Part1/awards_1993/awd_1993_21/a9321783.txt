Abstract    :
              9321783  Lange    This Doctoral Dissertation Research award provides support to 
              test a comparative theory of the institutional structure of the  legislature
              based on the strategic interaction of the executive  and policy agents
              independent from the central government in  parliamentary systems.  The
              investigator constructs a new  institutional model of the legislature which can
              be tested in a  cross-national context, relating the interests and bargaining 
              strategies of the executive and policy agents to the influence of  legislative
              committees in the policy-making process.  The  researcher will conduct detailed
              case studies of legislative  influence over policy-making in Germany and the
              United Kingdom to  test the implications of the model in three policy areas: 
              1)  budget and appropriations; 2) education and training; and, 3)  industrial
              relations.    This study promises to enhance our understanding of the topic in 
              a potentially important way.  ***
