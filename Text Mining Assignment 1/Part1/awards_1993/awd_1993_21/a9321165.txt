Abstract    :
              This proposal has two distinct parts.  The first part  concerns the evaluation
              of item and temperature dependent  correlation functions in the one-dimensional
              Heisenberg  model.  The second is a study of  SO (4) symmetry in the  Hubbard
              model, its implications for spectral properties,  correlation functions, and
              thermodynamical and transport  properties.  ***
