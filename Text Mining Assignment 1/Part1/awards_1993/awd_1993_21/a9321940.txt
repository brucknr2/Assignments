Abstract    :
              9321940  Tigyi    This project continues to research a novel and yet not fully 
              identified class of lipid mediators with growth factor-like  properties
              generated during blood clotting.  These  phospholipid mediators display
              functions similar to those of  the more delicate and complicated growth factor
              proteins.  The simple structure of the phospholipid mediators permits  their
              easy chemical synthesis on an industrial scale, at a  cost hundreds of times
              less than that of protein growth  factors.  These naturally occurring molecules
              are generated  in response to injury, not only in the blood, but also in  the
              nervous system; and experiments indicate that they are  likely to play a
              physiological role in the initiation of  regeneration and wound healing.  The
              current project sets  two goals:  1) determine the structure of the
              phospholipid  mediators generated during blood clotting, and 2) establish  the
              main biochemical pathways leading to the production of  growth factor-like
              lipid mediators in activated cells.  It  is anticipated that learning more
              about these factors can  ultimately lead to the design and synthesis of new
              drugs to  prevent secondary neuronal death and the ensuing paralysis.    ***
