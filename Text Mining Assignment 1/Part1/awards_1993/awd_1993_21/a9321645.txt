Abstract    :
              9321645  Ruby  Bioluminescent marine bacteria of the species,  Vibrio  fischeri,
              are the light organ symbionts of the sepiolid  squid genera Euprymna, and
              Sepiola.  Bacterial colonization  of the developing light organ results in the
              establishment  of a successful association by one specific subset (or 
              subspecies) of Vibrio fischeri strains.  This project will  examine populations
              of V. Fischeri in several overlapping  species of sepiolid squid from two
              locations, and will  determine whether these populations of V. fischeri are
              host  specific.  Through the use of PCR amplification, restriction  fragment
              length polymorphism (RFLP), and sequence analysis  of both host and symbiont
              DNA, the phylogenetic  relationships both among various strains of  V. fischeri
               and among sepiolid squid species will be inferred.    Along with the molecular
              phylogenetic analysis, cross-  colonization experiments will be completed to
              determine  whether the symbiotic bacteria are able to initiate any 
              colonization in other host species of squid.  Strains that  colonize animals
              other than their host species, will be  tested for the degree, success, and
              competitive dominance  with the natural symbiotic strain.  This model is the
              only  known type of animal/bacterial symbioses where both host and  symbiont
              can be cultured successfully and independently from  one another, and provides
              a unique experimental system to  address the role of evolution in symbioses.
