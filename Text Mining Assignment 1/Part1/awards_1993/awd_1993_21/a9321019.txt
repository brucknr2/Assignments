Abstract    :
              9321019  Jasso         This project is part of a program of theoretical
              research,  with a substantive focus on social comparison theory and a 
              methodological focus on the mathematical and statistical  techniques of
              theoretical work.  There are two overarching goals.   The first goal is to
              extend and refine comparison theory and  prepare it for empirical test, by
              renewed scrutiny of its  postulates, continued derivation of implications for
              varied  domains.  The second goal is to systematize and sharpen the  methods
              employed in the development of comparison theory,  especially through computer
              simulation, so that they can be used  in the development of other theories. 
              %%%       Social comparison theory is one of the chief contenders for  a
              scientific model of how people decide whether they have been  treated justly in
              social exchanges, and thus it offers a  theoretical basis for explanations of
              many forms of human  behavior in situations marked by competition.  This
              abstract  theoretical work lays the intellectual basis for empirical  research
              applied to human problems.    ***
