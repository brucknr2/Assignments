Abstract    :
              9321204  Clark  This award supports a study of Paleozoic conodonts from cores
              collected on the  Northwind Ridge in the Arctic Ocean.  The conodonts include
              both Permian and either  Ordovician or Silurian forms and were derived from
              submarine weathering of Paleozoic  rocks underlying Northwind Ridge.  Study of
              these conodonts is expected to lead to  fingerprinting of the Paleozoic
              stratigraphic units.  This information will provide  constraints for the
              original location of the crustal block represented by the Northwind  Ridge and
              this, in turn, will help to constrain models of the tectonic evolution of the 
              Amerasian Basin portion of the Arctic Ocean basin.  ***
