Abstract    :
              9321224  Gleason    Fundamental materials science issues related to the chemical
               passivation of electronically active states on porous silicon  surfaces will
              be investigated for the first time by H,F, and Si  NMR.  The approach pursued
              will allow unique, quantitative, and  non-destructive chemical information to
              be obtained.  Effects of  anodization conditions, substrate doping and
              orientation, thermal  treatments in a variety of ambients, additional etching,
              and film  growth on top of porous silicon layers will be studied.  
              Photoluminescence measurements will directly link surface  composition to
              optical properties.  the goal is to produce stable  surfaces with low defect
              densities and enhanced photoluminescence  and electroluminescence properties.  
               %%%%    Microscopic spacings in porous silicon may provide unique quantum- 
              confinement effects giving rise to very desirable optoelectronic  properties. 
              This material can be readily produced by anodizing  single-crystal silicon
              wafers in concentrated HF, and research of  this type has potential to provide
              the fundamental basis for  development of inexpensive optical devices which are
              compatible and  useful for enhancing the capabilities of silicon-based
              integrated  circuitry used in computers, information processing, and display 
              technologies.  ***
