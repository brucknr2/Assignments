                    ABSTRACT  CTS-9321876  Pennsylvania State University  P. I.:  Gita Talmage
                   This work consists of numerical and analytical research on the effect of
              magnetic fields on the Czochralski crystal-growth process.  The unique feature
              rests with the examination of magnet fields flow instabilities that affect
              crystal growth.  There are two principal problems to be examined.  The first
              consists of the transition from steady laminar to unsteady, periodic laminar
              flow within an interior.  The second focuses on flow instabilities due to
              thermocapillary effects.  These problems are posed in terms of the equations of
              magnetohydrodynamics in which added to the usual Navier-Stokes equations are
              terms that model the production of momentum due to the electromagnetic filed. 
              Czochralski crystal-growth is a widely used microelectronics.  The melt is an
              electrically conducting fluid and, is often in the presence of a magnet field
              which strongly influence the bulk flows and hence the quality of the final
              product.
