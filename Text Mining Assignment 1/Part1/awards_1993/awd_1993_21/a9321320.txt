Abstract    :
                  The project proposes to coordinate continuing U.S. activities that have   
              resulted in improved access to polar bibliographic information resources.   
              Publication of research results by the polar scientific community continues   
              to increase rapidly with 15,000 to 20,000 new papers being indexed annually.   
              It is essential to deliver access to these research results to  the desktop   
              of every potential user of polar regions information in the most ,user-friendly
              manner possible. This project provides funding for three    annual meetings of
              a polar information working group, in 1994, 1995 and 1996, to be held in
              Cambridge, UK, Washington, DC, and Anchorage, Alaska. Individuals representing
              U.S. bodies that provide polar information and/or information services will
              participate in each meeting.    Effective dissemination of polar regions
              information is necessary for the    United States to carry out research and
              management activities provided for    in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of
              1984 (amended 1990), the U.S.    Arctic Research Plan and its revisions, and
              the U.S. Antarctic Program    (USAP).
