Abstract    :
              9321162  Marcus  This dissertation research project will examine the role of 
              economists in Slovenia's transition from socialist to capitalist  market
              systems.  Formerly Yugoslavia's frontier with the West,  Slovenia declared its
              autonomy on June 26, 1991.  Economists have  been working throughout Eastern
              Europe to advance democracy and  market reforms, and in Slovenia the role of
              economists has risen  to prominence in unexpected ways.  The importance
              accorded to  these reforms and to the specialized knowledge used to define 
              them has allowed economists in Slovenia to emerge as a powerful  intellectual
              elite accorded a crucial role in the construction of  an independent and stable
              nation.  This study will examine their  role and analyze how their activities
              influence other spheres of  change.      Slovenia's transition has been
              considered thus far a success, due  to its relatively peaceful independence
              form Yugoslavia, its  successful preliminary economic reforms, and its current 
              political and economic stability.  This study will provide a rare  opportunity
              to probe the political and cultural aspects of the  construction and
              implementation of economic reforms, allowing for  a better understanding of the
              political, economic and cultural  changes redefining nations across Eastern
              Europe and the former  Soviet Bloc.  Preliminary research has been done to
              develop  contacts and arrangements in Ljubljana, and to review relevant 
              documents and conduct interviews at the World Bank and other  sources in
              Washington DC.  These funds will allow research in  Ljubljana, the capital of
              Slovenia, for a year, beginning in  March 1994.  ***
