Abstract    :
              9321385  Zimmer       Zimmer will investigate several questions concerning  the 
              actions of semisimple Lie groups and their discrete  subgroups on  manifolds. 
              This will include the topological, geometric,  and  analytic features of the
              spaces on which these groups act,  and  the corresponding features of the
              actions themselves.  He  will  also study application of these questions to
              ergodic theory  and  differential geometry.       This project involves
              research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic  theory in general concerns understanding
              the average  behavior of  systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic
              to be  followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics  can  be
              placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract  transformations act on
              smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic  theory  makes contact with geometry in its
              quest to classify flows  on  homogeneous spaces.  ***
