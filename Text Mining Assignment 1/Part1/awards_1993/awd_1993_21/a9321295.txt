Abstract    :
              9321295  Poulter  This award from the Synthetic Organic Program will support a 
              series of three annual "Workshops on Organic Synthesis and  Natural Products
              Chemistry."  These workshops have the dual  purpose of (1) providing an
              effective forum for informal  discussion among young scientists on current
              research in  topical areas of organic synthesis and natural products, and  (2)
              assisting the Program staff in identifying emerging areas  and researchers. 
              This process, in turn, will aid the Program  in long-range planning.    The
              specific goals of the workshops include:    1) Providing an environment for the
              dynamic exchange of ideas  in organic synthesis and natural products chemistry
              among a  small group (about 20) of active young researchers in these  fields.  
               2) Encouraging an attitude of cooperation amoung individuals  working in
              related areas, and thereby, avoiding duplicative  efforts.    3) Stimulating
              participants to study new problems and methods  in syntheic and natural
              products chemistry.    4) Creating an atmosphere in which the scientific and
              social  interaction among participants will be both stimulating and  pleasant.
