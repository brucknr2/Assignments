Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-21456    The grant supplies funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/Vs MELVILLE, a 279 foot vessel, NEW HORIZON, a 170 foot
              vessel, and the SPROUL, a 125 foot vessel.  The MELVILLE is owned by the Navy,
              but the NEW HORIZON and the SPROUL are owned by the University.  All the ships
              are operated by the Institute in support of oceanographic research funded by a
              variety of Federal, state and private organizations.  Instrumentation requested
              includes both shared-use equipment for specific ships and shared-use
              instrumentation that will be maintained by the central Ocean Data Facility
              (ODF) and used aboard a variety of ships.  The instrumentation requested is
              required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON and
              SPROUL during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in
              the future.  Some of the equipment will also be used aboard the R/V KNORR, a
              vessel operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, during WOCE cruises in
              the Arabian Sea.
