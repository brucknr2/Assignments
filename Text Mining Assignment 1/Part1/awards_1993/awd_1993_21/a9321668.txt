Abstract    :
              9321668  Barrett           This proposal has two main thrusts.  The first  is a
              continuation of the study of the microscopic  effective interaction in nuclei,
              taking advantage of  new theoretical insights on the effective interaction, 
              along with better  computing capability, with  applications to a variety of
              spectral and reaction  problems.  The second centers on the use of the 
              Interacting Boson Model for the study of nuclear  deformations, as well as the
              identical-band problem.  ***
