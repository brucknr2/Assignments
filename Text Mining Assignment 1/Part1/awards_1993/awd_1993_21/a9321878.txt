Abstract    :
              9321878  Alexander       This award supports mathematical research on problems 
              arising in the theory of several complex variables.  Four primary  areas will
              be consider in this project.  The first concerns  polyharmonic interpolations
              continuous functions on C-1 curves in  the boundary of the unit ball.  The
              second area focuses on a  unique continuation property and weak Hopf lemma for
              holomorphic  mappings from the plane to higher dimensional spaces.  Also, work 
              will be done on an extremal problems about hulls and spheres in  complex
              two-dimensional space.  Finally, an investigation of  the disc-hull and other
              properties of hulls which arise by a  linking process will be taken up. 
              Special emphasis will be  placed on studying the ball of the Lagrangian disc of
               Duval.Several complex variables arose at the beginning of  the century as a
              natural outgrowth of studies of functions of  one complex variable.  It became
              clear early on that the  theory differed widely from it predecessor.  The
              underlying  geometry was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory 
              had far more affinity with partial differential operators of  first order.  It
              thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep  characteristics of differential
              geometry and differential  equations.  Many of the fundamental structures were
              defined in  the last three decades.  Current studies still concentrate on 
              understanding these basic mathematical forms.  ***
