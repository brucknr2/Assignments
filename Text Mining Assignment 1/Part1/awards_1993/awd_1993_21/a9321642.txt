Abstract    :
              9321642  Davidson  This project is the continuation of an investigation of the 
              transport of chemical trace elements and species from source  regions through
              the atmosphere to the Greenland ice sheet.  Its  goal is to provide information
              for the interpretation of the trace  element distribution in a long ice core
              being obtained through the  Greenland Ice Sheet Program (GISP-2) drilling
              effort.  The ice core  is expected to provide a detailed record spanning
              200,000 years.    The project has three specific objectives: (1) the
              identification  of source regions and atmospheric pathways for the chemical 
              constituents reaching the drill site, including the possible  changes in air
              mass characteristics during transit, (2) the study  of the wet and dry
              deposition mechanisms and rates of incorporation  of chemical species into
              precipitating snow, and (3) the  development of methods of interpreting the
              deep ice core data.   Prior field work has resulted in the collecting of air,
              aerosol,  precipitation, and deposited snow samples, which will be analyzed 
              for various anions and cations, trace elements, carbon compounds,  and trace
              gases.  This project will emphasize the deposition  mechanisms.  ***
