Abstract    :
              9321964  Zhu        This award supports mathematical research on problems 
              related to the modern theory of functions of a complex variable  and operator
              theory for operators defined on spaces of such  functions.  The primary
              objective of the work focuses on the  structure of Bergman spaces of analytic
              function defined in a  disc.  Recent results have established a factorization
              of  functions in the Bergman spaces similar to that found in the  classic Hardy
              spaces.  With this new development arises the  possibility that a
              classification of the subspaces invariant  under multiplication by the identity
              function will be possible.   Work will be done on this question.  A second,
              related line of  investigation concerns Toeplitz operators arising from
              projection  of functions into the Bergman space.  One question of particular 
              interest is the identification of those Toeplitz operators which  are
              hyponormal.  Finally, work will be done on Bergman spaces in  several complex
              variables to study those domains for which the  Bergman projection of the
              Lp-functions is surjective onto the  space of Lp-holomorphic functions.       
              Studies in complex analysis combine the regularity of  analytic functions, the
              geometry of complex domains and the  subtleties of boundary characteristics to
              provide a basis for  deep and powerful ideas relating many different areas of 
              mathematics.  The application have ranged from partial  differential equations
              and harmonic analysis to the geometry of  circle packing.   ***
