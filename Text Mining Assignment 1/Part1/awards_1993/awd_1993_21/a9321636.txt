Abstract    :
              9321636     Hunt  The project compares seabirds and zooplankton populations in
              the  St. Lawrence Island Polynya (SLIP) and in the Gulf of Anadyr  Polynya
              (GAP).  The SLIP is shallow (30-40m) and is expected to  have a sluggish water
              circulation when compared to the strongly  advective regime expected for the
              deeper (50-200m) GAP.   Scientists predict that the ocean zooplankton community
              of the  GAP will be dominated by pelagic Neocalanus species that have  been
              advected from the slope region of the Bering Sea.  Whereas  in the SLIP,  small
              coastal species will probably dominate but  not until late in the season.  The
              premise of the project is that  seabird communities occupying the open ocean
              polynyas will  reflect the relative abundance of pelagic food web and that 
              zooplanktivorous auklets will be more abundant in the GAP than in  the SLIP. 
              It's expected that SLIP seabird diets will reflect an  epibenthic dominated
              food web and carbon fixed in previous season  contrary to that in GAP, where
              carbon from the current year's  production may be advected from the slope in
              growing copepods.  This integrated study will provide a first order estimate of
              the  potential influence of seabirds on polynya carbon budgets, and  the first
              accounts of zooplankton and seabirds in western Arctic  polynyas with differing
              advective regimes and presumed carbon  cycling pathways.  ***
