Abstract    :
                               LBP:\A9321194            Park              This project
              supports the dissertation research of an            anthropology student from
              the University of Arizona, studying the            impact of ethnicity and
              state intervention on small-scale,            intensive irrigated agriculture
              in Morocco.  Using a combination            of archival and ethnographic
              research, the student will study two            villages, one with a sure
              source of irrigation water from a water            control project, and one
              with the traditional insecure sources of            water.  The student will
              interview members of the three dominant            ethnic groups in these
              villages to investigate how social class,            ethnicity, and access to
              development programs interact to affect            the productivity of
              small-holder farming.             This research is important because
              traditional farmers in many            parts of the world are involved with
              state irrigation programs.            Increased understanding of local cases
              such as this one, of how            ethnic differences and social-economic
              class position within the            village affect the farmers' ability to
              take advantage of state-            sponsored programs, and whether these
              programs actually increase            productivity, will provide valuable
              information to economic            development planners.             ***
