Abstract    :
              9321043  USC  Postel    The major project elements for the routing arbiter
              include  advancement of Internet routing algorithms with respect to scaling 
              and stability issues, routing information registration and  dissemination for
              the network service providers serving the  Internet, deployment of route
              servers to aid in the dissemination  and real time maintenance of the global
              Internet routing system,  and coordination and sharing of technical information
              in support of  the Internet operations community.  A key task for the routing 
              arbiter will be to enhance the use of new switched services offered  by the
              telecommunications carriers, sucy as ATM, in place of  dedicated point to point
              technology that is widely deployed in wide  area internets.    This proposal is
              a part of a collaborative effort with Merit.   Although both Merit and USC
              teams will collaborate in all areas,  USC will take the lead with the route
              servers, advanced routing  development, provision of a testbed and routing
              engineering and  Merit will take the lead for management and coordination, 
              transition, and operations.  While Merit will take the lead in  overall
              coordination, USC will see that apprpriate collaboration is  accomplished in
              research and development.
