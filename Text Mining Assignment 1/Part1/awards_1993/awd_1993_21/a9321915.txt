Abstract    :
              9321915  Givental       The research entails studies of the mirror symmetry 
              conjecture for Calabi-Yau manifolds and related problems. The  conjecture is
              viewed in terms of classes of differential  equations having hypergeometric
              solutions. Techniques from  conformal field theory, topology and symplectic
              geometry will be  implemented approaching these problems. The research has 
              potential applications to string theory in mathematical physics.  ***
