Abstract    :
              9321977  Stermitz  The focus of this research will be the study of the 
              biosynthesis of 2,6-disubstituted piperidine alkaloids in  Ponderosa pine and
              Colorado blue spruce.  Further, the  bioactivity testing of the alkaloids
              should define the  importance of these compounds in plant/herbivore
              interactions.  Research on plant/insect interactions center on the study of 
              iridoid glycosides from Scrophulariaceae and the specialist  lepodoptera whose
              larva feed on the plants.  It is anticipated  that free-flying butterflies can
              be used to help identify  larval food plants.  %%%  With this renewal award,
              the Synthetic Organic Program is  supporting the research of Dr. Frank R.
              Stermitz of the  Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University.
              Professor  Stermitz will focus his work on the isolation, stucture, 
              biosynthesis and ecological role piperidine alkaloids in  conifer species and
              in the isolation and structural  characterization of iridoid glycosides and the
              importance of  these compounds in plant/insect interactions.  ***
