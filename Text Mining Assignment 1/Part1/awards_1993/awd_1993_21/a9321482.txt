Abstract    :
               9321482  McClearn   This is a proposal to use anatomical features of the
              primitive eutherian (placental) mammals to generate hypotheses about the
              phylogenetic (genealogical) relationships of these animals.  These hypotheses
              will be used as the framework for a study of the unusual feeding mechanisms of
              primitive eutherians.  Many of these creatures, which include armadillos,
              sloths, anteaters and pangolins, are specialized for feeding on ants, and the
              various peculiarities of the tongue and digestive tract may have been developed
              independently in some of these mammalian lines.  Little is known about the
              comparability of the anatomical features among these mammals.  %%%   This study
              will yield much useful information about relationships among early mammals and
              their specializations for myrmecophagy (ant-eating).  This mammalian group has
              received little recent attention in phylogenetic research and this study will
              allow resolution of questions about transformations in the musculature of the
              tongue, palate and pharynx and the innervation of these structures in early
              mammals.
