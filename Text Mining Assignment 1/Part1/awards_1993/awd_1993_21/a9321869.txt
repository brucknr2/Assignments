Abstract    :
              9321869  Shenai  Description:  This proposal requests INT travel  support for US
              participation at an  international conference to initiate US-Indo 
              collaborative research in advanced  optoelectronic systems.  Professor Krishna 
              Shenai of the University of Wisconsin-Madison  is the principal US organizer
              for the  "Conference on Emerging Optoelectronic  Technologies (CEOT)" that will
              be held at the  Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, July  18-22, 1994.  The
              first CEOT-91 was highly  successful and resulted in the publication of  four
              major archival works and the  identification of four optoelectronic thrust 
              areas for possible collaboration.  At CEOT-94,  US delegates will visit two of
              India's leading  industrial laboratories, the Bharat Electronics  Laboratories
              and Indian Telephone Industries,  in Bangalore.  Continued advances in 
              information processing can not be achieved  using electronics alone.  Optical
              computing,  optical communication, and optically triggered  microelectronics
              are expected to revolutionize  advanced systems.  Major innovations in 
              material technologies, micro-electronics,  interconnect technologies, and
              system  architecture will be required to achieve these  objectives.    Scope: 
              India is a leading developing country  that has  significant potential for the 
              implementation and manufacture of low-cost  technologies.  This is based on an
              enormous  pool of  engineering talent, low costs for  labor, and access to
              global markets.  Recent  technological and economic advances in India  affirm
              the expectation of continued growth.   Increased scientific exchange between
              India and  the US is important to intelligently tap the  resources available
              there and to maintain a  long term healthy relationship between the  countries.
               Non-Resident Indian scientists are  a readily available resource in the US to 
              catalyze this activity and to provide the  synergism needed for establish-ing
              an active  interface for long term technical exchange.   ***
