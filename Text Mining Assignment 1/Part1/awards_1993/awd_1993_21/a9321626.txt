Abstract    :
              9321626     Oberbauer  Global warming will substantially increase the length of
              the  active season for high latitude ecosystems, but many plant  species in
              these areas have phenological patterns adapted to  short growing seasons. 
              Some, but not all, of the factors that  affect phenological stages will change
              with global warming.   Those species constrained by cues that will be unchanged
              with  global warming, such as photoperiod, will be unable to respond to 
              extended season length.  As a result, species composition,  productivity, and
              carbon fluxes from these ecosystems will change  substantially.  Using Alaskan
              tundra as a model system, this  project addresses the questions: 1) What are
              the constraints on  phenological patterns for the dominant species? 2) What 
              physiological adjustments will species make in response to an  extended period
              of resource availability? 3) How will growth of  the dominant species,
              ecosystem productivity, and ecosystem  carbon fluxes change under
              field-simulated extended seasons?   These questions will be addressed using a
              combination of  controlled-environment studies and field manipulations of
              season  length.  Growth chamber studies will examine the effects of 
              photoperiod, soil and air temperature, and leaf age on  phenological patterns
              and carbon gain of selected species of the  dominant growth forms.  Field
              studies will examine the effects of  extended active period on phenology,
              growth, productivity, and  ecosystem carbon balance.  Results from this study
              will be used  to develop a model of phenological patterns of tundra plants that
               can be used to evaluate species' responses to extended growing  season.  ***
