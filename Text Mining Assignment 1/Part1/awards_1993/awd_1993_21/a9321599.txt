Abstract    :
              9321599  Gensel       Under the direction of faculty adviser Dr. Patricia Gensel
              at  the University of North Carolina, graduate student Douglas Jensen  is
              studying fossil materials of the extinct group of early land  plants known as
              zosterophylls, which are thought to be related to  the extant genus Lycopodium.
               Specimens from numerous museum  collections are to be examined in an effort to
              amass data on  comparable features of the stem, root, and spore-bearing
              structures  of these primitive plants, in order to improve delimitation of 
              recognizable species and genera and to infer phylogenetic  relationships among
              the taxa.  Of theoretical interest, the study  will also include an
              investigation of how fragmentary fossil  materials may be used in compiling
              data matrices for phylogenetic  inference.       New collections of fossil
              zosterophylls from around the world  provide new sources of data for improved
              taxonomic discrimination  in this group of primitive land plants and for
              rigorous hypotheses  of phylogenetic relationship.
