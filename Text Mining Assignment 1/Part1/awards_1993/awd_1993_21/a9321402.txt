Abstract    :
              9321402  Schaffer       The project is to learn about how statisticians would
              tackle  the problems that serve as a central testbed for machine learning 
              research (e.g., the UCI repositioning).  In particular, the  proposed work will
              be concerned with the following four questions:   (1)  What model classes and
              fitting procedures do statisticians  choose when faced with supervised learning
              problems drawn from the  UCI repository?  (2)  On what basis do they make their
              choices?   (3)  How are results of data analysis interpreted to make 
              predictions?  (4)  How accurate are these predictions?
