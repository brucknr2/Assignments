Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT      The  National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) proposes an
               ARCSS (Arctic System Science) Data Coordination Center at  NSIDC to integrate
              management of data for LAII, OAII, GISP2.  PALE, and the emerging Arctic
              Archaeology component.  In  this three-year view, NSIDC envisions a distributed
              set of  ARCSS data archives with data sets held in appropriate  centers
              (including NSIDC), linked by NSIDC's  "front end"  coordination to ensure  that
              ARCSS-funded researchers can  easily obtain required data, and to guarantee
              archival of  data they collect during ARCSS.  The "front end", or Data 
              Coordination Center, will produce these results:   a.  ARCSS  and other Arctic
              data sets and products of importance  to  ARCSS science priorities will be
              catalogued and described in  a published ARCSS Catalog and  in the Global
              Change Master  Directory;  b.  ARCSS and other Arctic data  sets and  products
              will be easy to access and to use for research;  c.  ARCSS  data sets will be
              coordinated and managed within the  framework of established and emerging U.S.
              and international  data systems and centers;  d.  A data accession and archival
               system for ARCSS data sets and products will be established  at NSIDC;  e. 
              Guidelines for data formats and documents,  including GIS and model output data
              sets, will be developed  and promulgated within the ARCSS aommunity;  f. 
              Tailored  data products, on CD-ROM, diskette, and via electronic file  transfer
               will be delivered to ARCSS investigators;  g.  NSIDC will work with the ARCSS
              Data  Management Working  Group, ARCSS Modeling Working Group, and ARCSS
              Science  Steering Committees to identify data priorities for ARCSS-  funded
              research;  h.  Exchange of information about data  sets and data-related
              activities among members of the ARCSS  community will be facilitated by an
              electronic bulletin  board, newsletter, and information clearinghouse at NSIDC;
               and  i.  Initiate work on a geocryological database by  capitalizing on recent
              opportunities to obtain da ta from the  former Soviet Union.
