Abstract    :
              9321727  Merz    U.S.-Japan Collaborative Project in Quantum  Transitions in
              Nanostructures    This is a cooperative project between the NSF  Center for
              Quantized Electronic Structures  (QUEST), University of California, Santa 
              Barbara and the University of Tokyo.  The  Japanese portion of the project is
              supported by  the Research Development Corporation of Japan  (JRDC).  The
              principal investigators are James  L. Merz, Center Director, and Professor 
              Hiroyuki Sakaki, University of Tokyo.    Through an exchange of personnel,
              specifically  postdoctoral fellows and senior investigators,  the two groups
              will carry out research in four  different but related experimental areas, with
               an effort in fundamental theory of quantum  transitions overlaying these four
              areas:  (1)  optical and far infrared transitions in quantum  wells, quantum
              wires, and other nanostructures,  and their infrared and photo-conductive 
              responses; (2) relaxation and scattering  processes involving electrons and/or
              holes,  both within the quantum states and between  them; (3) periodic alloys
              and their  fluctuations of alloy composition in quantum  wells, including their
              effect on optical and  electronic transitions; and (4) advanced growth  and
              processing technology and material science  for novel nanostructure formation,
              with  emphasis on the in-situ study of grown  structures and surfaces to expand
              the  controllability of the perfection of  nanostructures.  It is expected that
              the  project will generate considerable new and  important information
              concerning both the  growth process and the nature of the surfaces  that result
              from this growth process.  ***
