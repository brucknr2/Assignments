                      9321193 MERRIFIELD        &  ABSTRACT   Palantla Chinantec is an
              Otomanguean language spoken by over 10,000 residents, primarily rural farmers,
              of the State of Oaxaca, Mexico. The primary research objective of this project
              is to complete the development of a cross indexed Chinantec Spanish English
              lexical database and to produce from it (a) a published bilingual Chinantec
              Spanish Spanish Chinantec dictionary, for use by both the Palantla Chinantec
              speaking and academic communities, and (b) a trilingual, Chinantec Spanish
              English electronic version specifically designed for the academic community.
              The completed trilingual version of the lexicon will be made available to
              language database distribution systems such as are being developed at various
              Universities. The provisional markup conventions now being used by the PI will
              be made to conform to standard guidelines for lexical markup currently being
              designed by the Text Encoding Initiative when they are ready.           From
              the point of view of scholarship, this research should be done to provide a
              complete and well rounded recorded record of an important Native American
              language. A considerable quantity of documentation of the language and culture
              has been assembled, but lexical information remains scanty. It is important
              that several of the extant Chinantec languages receive such documentation while
              the languages are viable and experienced scholars are available to assist in
              documentation . From a humanitarian point of view, the scholarly community has
              an obligation to share its resources in ways that benefit the human subjects
              they depend upon in the pursuit of the academic objectives. The provision of a
              document as valuable as a bilingual dictionary to a marginalized community such
              as the Palantla Chinantec, is in its own right ample motivation to do this
              work.
