Abstract    :
              9223752  MENZEL    This proposal requests support for shipboard scientific
              support   equipment for the research vessel BLUE FIN, operated by the   
              Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, and dedicated to use in    support of ocean
              science research.      The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct  of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such 
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data 
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Dr. David Menzel is fully qualified
              to direct  this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the 
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.      This project will
              allow the institution to acquire a GPS and  fathometer and to replace the
              ship's defective steering system.  ***
