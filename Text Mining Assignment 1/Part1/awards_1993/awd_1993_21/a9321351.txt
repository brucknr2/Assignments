Abstract    :
              9321351  Drukier    The goal of the proposed research is to develop low cost
              desktop and portable systems with very high computational capabilities for both
              scientific and applied engineering applications.  In Phase I we developed a
              transputer-based hardware platform coupled with a very powerful analytical
              tool, the wavelet transform.  We demonstrated that with appropriate coding the
              wavelet algorithm allows almost perfect parallelization, i.e. the computational
              speed is practically proportional to the number of transputers used.  The Phase
              I results demonstrate that the hardware/software system we developed is
              scalable over two orders of magnitude in speed and memory.      The Phase II
              effort will consist of software development for two-dimensional wavelet
              transforms and its implementation on next-generation HTRAM transputers.  The 2D
              algorithms will be optimized for high efficiency (25:1 or better) real time
              image compression as well as for a number of other applications.  These include
              analysis of destructive wave propagation in complex mechanical structures,
              properties of nonlinear dynamical systems, and the properties of stochastic
              webs and percolation clusters.  These analyses have important applications in
              turbulent diffusion, transport properties in plasma physics, hydrodynamics, and
              magnetic field generation.  ***
