Abstract    :
              9321811  Hammer    This three-year award will support a U.S.-Belgium 
              collaboration in applied mathematics and operations  research.  The
              investigators are Peter L. Hammer and Endre  Boros of Rutgers University and
              Yves Crama of the University  of Liege. The objective of their research is to
              conduct a  systematic study of discrete optimization and its  application to
              planning and scheduling models for automated  manufacturing systems.  They will
              investigate problems in  local optimization and local optima; nonlinear
              inequalities  in 0-1 variables; and occurring nonlinear 0-1 models.  They  will
              develop algorithms, based on this research, for some  specific problems in
              operations research.  The project takes  advantage of U.S. expertise in
              nonlinear 0-1 optimization  and combinatorial operations research.  This is
              complemented  by Belgium expertise in planning and scheduling models for 
              automated manufacturing systems.    Discrete optimization is one of the most
              rapidly developing  fields in  mathematical sciences.  Current research
              literature in this  field focuses on "linear" models in 0-1 variables.  This 
              proposal addresses new problems in nonlinear models.   Such  models have
              applications in production management, VLSO  design, theoretical physics,
              finance and statistics for  example.  This project will advance understanding
              of  discrete optimization and nonlinear models and their  applications in
              science and engineering.  ***
