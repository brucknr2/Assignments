              Abstract  ATM-9321838  Kenny, Ray  New Mexico Highlands University  Title:
              Multivariate Paleoclimatic Analysis in Southern South  America with Emphasis on
              Transitional Periods    This award supports a multivariate paleoclimate study,
              using pollen  and stable isotope analyses, of peat cores from southern South 
              America.  These cores  are believed to contain a continuous record  since the
              last glacial/interglacial transition.  Results obtained  to date from the
              combined high resolution analyses of one peat  core, at latitude 55o in the
              Beagle Channel, indicate that the  pollen stratigraphy provides the perspective
              against which stable  isotope ratios can be better evaluated and that the
              combined  approach greatly augments the paleoclimatic information.  The goal 
              of the present effort is threefold: 1) refine the calibration of  the stable
              isotope data by both experimental laboratory studies  with mosses and indepth
              field studies of modern bogs; 2) confirm  the history of paleoclimatic change
              by analyzing other records from  the same general climatic region using the
              same approach; and 3)  confirm record of past changes in pCO2 by analyzing
              other records  from different regions in southern South America and also from
              the  northern hemisphere.  The combination of records of paleoclimatic  and
              paleo-carbon dioxide concentrations from several cores will  lead to a better
              understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of  abrupt climate change events.
