Abstract    :
              9321491  Oliver  New studies of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere by the 
              incoherent scatter technique with the MU (Middle and Upper  atmosphere) radar
              in Shigaraki, Japan are conducted in  collaboration with the Radio Atmospheric
              Science Center of Kyoto  University.  Prior studies have focussed largely
              either on short-  term climatology, or on the morphology of local ionospheric
              wave  propagation and tilts.  This award extends the climatology to the  better
              part of a solar cycle, and these results will form the  primary Asian-sector
              contribution to global models of electric  fields, neutral winds, and case
              studies.  New gravity-wave studies  exploit recent advances in identifying
              individual wave packets and  in measuring the dispersion relation for gravity
              waves and  simultaneous measurements with a new co-located passive meteor 
              radar.  Several recent advances in radar data reduction and  analysis have made
              some of these studies more feasible and all of  them more potentially
              productive.    ***
