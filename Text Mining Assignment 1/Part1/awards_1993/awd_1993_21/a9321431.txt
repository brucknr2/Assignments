Abstract    :
              This grant from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will support  
              Professor Novotny's investigations of the applications of pulsed-field  
              capillary electrophoresis (CE) in the separation and characterization of  
              polysaccharides and proteoglycans.  The goal  is to extend CE technology   to
              high molecular weight biopolymers in the range of 100,000 to   100,000,000
              Daltons. The materials to be investigated will include large   proteins, DNA
              molecules with unusual shapes, polysaccharides,   proteoglycans, and other
              biomolecules.  In addition, a  fundamental   investigation of the factors which
              control the rate of migration of large   molecules in pulsed electric fields
              will be carried out by Professor   Novotny and his students.      This research
              will extend the capabilities of capillary electrophoresis,   a method that
              allows the separation of charged components present in   complex macromolecular
              mixtures.  The goal is to be able to separate   large biomolecules with 
              molecular weights up to 100,000,000 Daltons.    Pulsed electric fields will be
              investigated in order to overcome many of   the problems encountered in the
              fractionation of mixtures of large   molecules by conventional capillary
              electrophoresis methods.  The   materials to be investigated include
              polysaccharides, carbohydrates, and   proteoglycans.  The  techniques developed
              in this project will be used to   separate large molecules of biochemical and
              technological significance
