Abstract    :
              9321673  Murty       This grant will support an International Symposium on  
              Mathematical Programming.  It is expected to draw over fifteen   hundred
              participants from all over the world.  This is the   fifteenth such meeting and
              will bring together researchers in all   facets of Mathematical Programming and
              its applications.  It is   expected that over twelve hundred talks will be
              presented at the   symposium.       The symposium is particularly important in
              that it will   facilitate the exchange of new theory and technology between  
              American scientists and scientists from other countries about   technology
              which is not well known in the United States.  It will   also include support
              and participation from industry.
