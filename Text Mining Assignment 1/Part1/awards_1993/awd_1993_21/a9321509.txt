              operations  (SCALOP).  The COMNAP secretariat is situated at the American 
              Geophysical Union in Washington, D.C.    The membership of COMNAP and SCALOP
              includes the representatives of  countries doing scientific research in
              Antarctica.  They have  consistently agreed on the necessity of an effective
              secretariat.   The Council members have declared the principle of membership
              and  support on an equal share basis, support comes form contributions  of 18
              national programs.    COMNAP has achieved maturity as an element of the
              Antarctic Treaty  System.  The report of the XVIIth Antarctic Treaty
              Consultative  Meeting, called for ".... full and continuing participation by 
              COMNAP at future ATCMs to provide advice and assistance on issues  relating to
              Antarctic operations."
