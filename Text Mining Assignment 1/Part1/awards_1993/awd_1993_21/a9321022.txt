Abstract    :
                  9321022  Shannon  The importance of market imperfections such as
              externalities in  both theoretical and policy-oriented research can hardly be 
              overstated.  Many of the most important questions in  macroeconomics, such as
              determining the factors that affect long-  term growth or explaining observed
              differences in growth and  development rates across countries, either could not
              be  meaningfully posed or could not be satisfactorily answered until  market
              imperfections such as externalities in production and  capital accumulation or
              distortionary government taxing and  spending were incorporated into growth
              theory.  However, most of  this work addresses these issues in highly
              specialized models  such as representative agent models, or models with
              parametricly  specified time separable preferences and technologies.  If these 
              models are perturbed to allow for more interaction across periods  in
              preferences of technologies, is an entirely new analysis  necessary?  Are
              conclusions of this new analysis radically  different?  The purpose of this
              project is to obtain robust  answers to these same questions which depend as
              little as  possible on assumptions about preferences or production 
              technologies.  This is done by studying the existence,  comparative statistics,
              and determinacy of equilibria in general  equilibrium models with externalities
              and an infinite number of  commodities.  The project also develops new methods
              for  comparative statics analysis in problems with potential market 
              distortions or imperfections.
