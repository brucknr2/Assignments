Abstract    :
              9321032  Enchautequi  Despite the fact that women in the United States have
              migration  rates comparable to those of men and that women comprise about  half
              of the moves, there is a dearth of research on women  migrants.  The purpose of
              this research is to analyze female  migration in the United States and to begin
              filling this gap in  our understanding of the decision of women to migrate and
              the  consequences for them of migration.  This research will also  contribute
              to the theory of household migration decision making  by extending bargaining
              models to the case of family migration   decision-making.  To carry out this
              study, the investigator will  use the Public Use Micro Files of the 1990 Census
              data and the  Panel Study of Income Dynamics.  From a policy point of view, 
              results from this project will illuminate debates of gender  inequality,
              affirmative action, and welfare migration.  ***
