Abstract    :
              9321930  TOBIN  Major disasters focus attention on the need for a better 
              understanding of the ways that individuals and communities assess  threats
              beforehand and react to events after catastrophic events.  Geographers and
              other social scientists have been concerned with  a variety of factors that
              affect underlying attitudes, reactions,  and behaviors associated with living
              in a hazardous area and/or  experiencing a catastophic event. This Small Grant
              for  Exploratory Research will provide support for a team of  experienced
              scientists to explore the psychological impact of the  massive flooding in the
              Midwest during the summer of 1993 on  residents of two different communities,
              one urban (Des Moines,  Iowa) and the other rural (Hartsburg, Missouri). The
              researchers  will be able to modify a survey form that has already proven 
              successful in a similar investigation of elderly residents near  the Trinity
              River in Texas, thus providing an excellent point of  comparison. The
              questionnaire also includes key questions that  were asked of Des Moines
              residents before the flooding. The study  will focus on three levels of factors
              influencing stress: the  primary level, including individual characteristics;
              the  secondary level, focussing on the degree of homogeneity within  the
              neighborhood; and the tertiary level, mainly the distinction  between urban and
              rural communities.       This project will provide new insights into the
              general  principles governing human attitudes and behaviors in hazardous 
              environments. It should prove especially useful to policy efforts  that attempt
              to institute pre-event mitigation as well as those  efforts designed to help
              victims cope after disastrous events.  The research will clarify the special
              roles which might be played  by the different types of communities in shaping
              the attitudes of  residents towards the hazard potential and in responding to 
              specific disasters.  ***
