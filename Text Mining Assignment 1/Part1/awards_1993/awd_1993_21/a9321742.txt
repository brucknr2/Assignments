Abstract    :
              Analysis of solid surfaces with high sensitivity, and with a broad   dynamic
              range, is important to a number of technologies, including   semiconductor
              processing and heterogeneous catalysis. In this research   project supported by
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, a   picosecond laser will be used
              to ionize species directly above a solid   surface, and then analyze them by
              time of flight mass spectrometry.    These species will be desorbed by ion beam
              or laser beam interaction with   the surface being analyzed.  The objectives of
              this research program are   to develop this surface analysis method by
              carefully characterizing the   photoionization process, measuring velocity and
              angular distributions of   sputtered particles, and by determining detection
              sensitivity factors and   relative neutral and ion fraction sputtering yields. 
                  In order to detect low levels of contaminants on semiconductor surfaces,  
              or to identify low coverage species in catalytic systems, it is necessary   to
              have available very sensitive surface analytical tools.  This research  
              program is designed to develop and perfect a very sensitive   photoionization
              probe of surface composition.  A fast laser pulse will be   used to ionize ion
              or laser desorbed species, and mass spectrometry will   be used to detect and
              identify the ions. This approach promises a   significant increase in surface
              analytical sensitivity over presently   available methods.
