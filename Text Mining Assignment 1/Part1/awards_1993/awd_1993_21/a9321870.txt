Abstract    :
              9321870  Hovy       This project supports a group of American researchers and 
              students in the area of natural language generation to attend a  workshop on
              that subject.  The objectives of the project include  but are not limited to
              those aspects of natural language generation  involving systems and
              applications that are relevant to technology  transfer, that have an
              international and multi-lingual orientation,  and that consider text planning
              as it influences automated  generation, database description, automated
              documentation, and  other aspects related to machine translation from the
              language  generation point of view.
