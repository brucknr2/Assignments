Abstract    :
               the major Siberian rivers in influencing physical, biological, and chemical
              mixing processes.  The chemical behavior of the radioisotopes selected for
              study will permit a "fingerprint" identification of the provenance of
              contaminants due to the variability in isotope or elemental ratios in each
              potential source.  The parallel use of other radioisotope, conservative tracer
              (delta^18O and delta D), and biologically modified tracer distributions
              (nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and by extension, NO and PO), will contribute to
              defining particle transport and water mixing mechanisms, in addition to
              describing the propagation patterns of contaminants.  ***
