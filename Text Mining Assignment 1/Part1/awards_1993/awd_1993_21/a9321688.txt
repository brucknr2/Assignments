Abstract    :
              INT 93-21688  Hyden    This dissertation enhancement grant supports a U.S.
              graduate student enrolled at the University of Florida, Ms. Kimberly Lanegran, 
              working under the guidance of Dr. Goran Hyden, Professor of Political Science,
              to do field research in South Africa.  The project will study  the role that
              South Africa's Civic Association movement has played in hastening political
              reform and  nurturing norms of civic participation among previously
              disenfranchised black South Africans.  The research will focus case studies on
              three communities (Lawaaikamp, Port Elizabeth, and Grahamstown)  in the Eastern
              Cape, an area with the longest history of politicization, which, however, has
              been relatively neglected in research.  The principal methods used will be
              interviews, participant observation, and archival research.  The candidate's
              research will be linked to ongoing projects on Civic Associations that are
              being conducted at two universities in other regions of the country.  She will
              participate in workshops organized by Dr. Tom Lodge at the University of
              Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg,  and will also be associated with Dr. Thomazile
              Botha's Local Government and Planning Policy Research Project at the University
              of the Western Cape, in Capetown.    This study by a promising young researcher
              will be a valuable contribution to comparative studies as well as to
              scholarship on South Africa.  It would illuminate the role that organizations
              of civil society play in the emergence of democratic states in developing
              countries.  The collaboration with South African scholars will build
              professional relationships that can be expect ed to endure throughout the
              individuals' careers.  ***
