Abstract    :
              9321420  Albert  The proposed project is a field study of the physical processes
               that affect the manner in which atmospheric constituents are  incorporated
              into polar snow and firn at the surface of the  Greenland ice sheet.  These
              processes are an important component in  reconstructing the characteristics of
              paleoatmospheres from the  observation of inclusions in deep ice cores, and
              consist of the  direct transport by the flow of air within the snow
              (advection),  the molecular scale dispersion (diffusion), and the effects of 
              solar radiation penetrating into the snow.  The air-to-snow  transfer of
              atmospheric constituents is filtered and potentially  altered by such
              processes.    The objectives are to define the magnitude and extent in space
              and  time of these transfer processes, and to develop a process-level 
              understanding and a capability to model these processes.  Field  studies will
              be conducted in central Greenland in the summer of  1994 to determine the
              spatial and temporal variability of key  parameters, and to observe boundary
              conditions needed to constrain  the model.  An existing multidimensional
              numerical model will be  extended and verified to simulate the advection,
              diffusion, and  radiation transmission/absorption processes.  ***
