Abstract    :
              9321557  Washburn    Technical abstract:  This Small Grants for Exploratory
              Research  project is a study of new nanostructures in silicon-germanium 
              alloys.  The structures include small point contacts, lateral  resonant
              tunneling devices and interferometers.  Three kinds of  devices will be
              fabricated:  (1) split-gate and shallow etched  point contacts and ballistic
              wires, (2) interferometers, and (3)  compound gate, lateral, one-dimensional
              resonant tunneling  structures and interferometers.  The experiments will
              extend the  study of quantum interference to a new materials system and provide
               the first controlled system for testing recent predictions of  conductance
              quantization in a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid.    Non-technical abstract: 
              New electronic devices depend on  increasingly smaller physical structures,
              so-called nanostructures.   One promising nanostructure material is gallium
              arsenide.  However,  it is more expensive to fabricate than traditional
              silicon.  This  Small Grants for Exploratory Research project is a university- 
              industry (IBM) collaboration which will explore nanostructures made  from
              silicon-germanium alloys.  The latter material can be  fabricated by
              traditional silicon technology.  The research will  explore the physics of
              these materials and determine their quantum  electronic properties in order to
              assess their potential as device  materials.  ***
