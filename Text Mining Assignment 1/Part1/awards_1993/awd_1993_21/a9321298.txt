Abstract    :
              9321298  Cozzens  This dissertation research explores the roles of interest
              groups in  agenda setting for federally supported research.  The focus is the 
              case of environmental research on global warming.  Unlike the  active
              involvement of voluntary organizations in policy making for  biomedical
              research, voluntary organizations in the environmental  arena have concentrated
              on regulatory rather than research policy.   The goal of the dissertation is to
              help to answer the questions of  whether and to what extent, and why this is
              so.   Currently, elite  and technical groups dominate in many science policy
              arenas.   Voluntary organizations that specialize in particular substantive 
              areas can play an important role in these arenas, by organizing  expertise and
              performing a boundary-spanning, translator role  between the broader public
              concerns and the concerns of the  scientific and technical communities.  While
              the role of voluntary  organizations in regulatory policy has been studied,
              their role in  longer-term goal-setting has not.  This study can therefore
              extend  our understanding of the role of voluntary organizations and  provide a
              step towards increasing democratic participation in  setting science agendas. 
              After he completes a review of archival  and other documents, the award allows
              the student to conduct  approximately 100 interviews with representatives from
              government  agencies, environmental organizations, and other groups that have 
              been involved in setting environmental research agendas.  The final  product of
              this research is a doctoral dissertation, associated  articles and
              presentations, and an executive summary for  interviewees and others from
              nonprofit voluntary organizations who  request it.  ***
