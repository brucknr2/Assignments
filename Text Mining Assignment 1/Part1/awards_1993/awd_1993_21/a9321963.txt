Abstract    :
              Professor Friedman is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on developing  
              statistical mechanical theories for ionic solutions.  Friedman uses   formal
              theory based on an integral equation treatment of a rigid,   nonpolarizable
              interaction site model (ISM) Hamiltonian.  Using this   theoretical model, he
              seeks to explain: 1) non-equilibrium solvation   dynamics, 2) dielectric and
              charge transfer phenomena, and 3)   thermodynamic, structure and transport
              phenomena in electrolyte   solutions.  Results are to be compared with computer
              simulations and   experiments.      The aim of this research project is to
              improve the way the measurable   properties of solutions are interpreted in
              terms of the interactions   among the molecular constituents.  This is
              particularly a challenge for   ionic solutions; the long range of the forces
              between the ionic charges   strongly affect both the measurable properties and
              the mathematical tools   needed to relate them to the molecular models.
