Abstract    :
                   This research project is focused on the measurement of  stable isotope
              ratios in several important atmospheric gases,  that is, ozone (O3), carbon
              dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO),  and water (H2O) vapor.  The previous
              NSF-supported project  demonstrated from precise isotopic measurements of
              oxygen-17 and  oxygen-18 in stratospheric ozone samples that a chemical link 
              exists between stratospheric ozone and carbon dioxide.  In  addition, the
              results from this prior research revealed that  stratospheric ozone is enriched
              in the two oxygen isotopes of O-  17 and O-18, and that this isotopic
              enrichment is transferred to  CO2 by its reaction with excited oxygen atoms 
              O(1D)  derived  from the photolysis of this isotopically enriched ozone.       
               During the next three years this same research team will  continue to expand
              their isotopic measurement program so as to  isotopically analyze air samples
              collected from ground level to  30 km and from 68oN to the south pole.  These
              measurements will  address the questions of the global and altitudinal
              variations of  the CO2-O3 interactions; the chemical and dynamical processes 
              responsible for the observed isotopic fractionations of molecular  oxygen (O2),
              O3, CO2, CO, nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor;  the possibility of an
              unknown stratospheric source of N2O; and  the potential utility of CO2 with its
              unique stratospheric  isotopic signature for quantification of
              mesosphere-stratosphere-  troposphere mixing.  The gas samples will be
              collected in  collaboration with a number of national and international 
              scientists who are performing vertical atmospheric measurements  with aircraft
              and balloon platforms,  The samples will be  analyzed with the isotope ratio
              mass spectrometers that are  available in the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of  California--San Diego.  Two graduate students will participate
              in  this research under the direct supervision of the senior  scientist.
