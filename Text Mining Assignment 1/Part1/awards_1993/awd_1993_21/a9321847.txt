Abstract    :
              9321847  Elitzur    Dr. Elitzur will continue theoretical research under the
              common theme of  application of radiative transfer techniques for spectral line
              analysis and  infrared emission in various astronomical environments.  Those
              environments  include star forming regions, the envelopes of late-type stars,
              and external  galaxies.
