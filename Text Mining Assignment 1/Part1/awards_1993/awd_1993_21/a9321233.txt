Abstract    :
              9321233  Toogood          The focus of this research wil be to determine the
              biosynthesis   of lanthionine and to synthesize the two natural products  
              motuporin and keramamide F.  The research will lead to a better   understanding
              of the function of didehydropeptides in natural   products.  %%%  With this
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. Peter
              L. Toogood of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of Michigan. 
              Professor Toogood   will focus his work on the synthesis and structure of
              several   didehydropeptide natural products and study the possibility of  
              building these residues into synthetic peptides and peptide   mimics.     ***
