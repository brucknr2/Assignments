Abstract    :
              Wieman  This proposal provides partial support for the Fourteenth  International
              Conference on Atomic Physics (ICAP XIV) to be held  July 31-August 5, 1994, on
              the campus of the University of  Colorado.  This biennial series is firmly
              established as the  principal international forum for the presentation and
              discussion  of fundamental advances in atomic physics.  It is the only 
              international meeting devoted to the full range of activity in  atomic physics.
               The conference program will be built around a  series of invited papers by
              scientists responsible for the most  significant recent developments.  Other
              speakers will present  overviews of selected subfields, or will discuss 
              interdisciplinary and technological impacts and opportunities.  Two large
              poster sessions will provide the format for one-on-one  scientific discussions.
