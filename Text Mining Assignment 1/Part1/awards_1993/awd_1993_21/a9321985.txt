Abstract    :
              9321985  Beaton    Under the direction of Dr. John Beaton, Mr. Douglas Bird will
               collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue his  research
              among Australian Aborigines who live along the shoreline  of the Torres
              Straits. Although these groups no longer follow a  strictly traditional hunting
              and gathering way of life and have  been partially integrated into the larger
              Australian economy,  they still rely heavily on shellfish which they gather
              from reefs  in the region. Mr. Beaton will use models based on optimal 
              foraging strategy and analyze subsistence practices. He and his  associate will
              observe foragers during the entire yearly round  and determine what factors
              govern shellfish collecting behavior.  This will involve intensive sampling and
              observation of  individual collectors. Activity diaries will be kept and the 
              amount of food per species and associated processing activities  will be noted.
                 Because food is essential for life and food collecting strategies  are
              behaviorally determined, both biologists and anthropologists  wish to
              understand subsistence strategies which different species  follow. When
              multiple kinds of resources of varying nutritional  value are unevenly
              distributed across a landscape, how do  foragers determine where to go and how
              to focus their efforts?  Because shellfish are sessile and their distribution
              is easy to  determine, they provide an excellent context in which to study 
              this issue.     This research is important because it will offer insight into 
              human foraging behavior. It will provide data of interest to both  cultural
              anthropologists and archaeologists and will also assist  in the training of a
              promising young scientist.  ***
