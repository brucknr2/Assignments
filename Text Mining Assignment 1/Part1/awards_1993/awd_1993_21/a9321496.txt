Abstract    :
              9321496  Davis       Oxidation products of organics in the atmosphere can be 
              expected to affect the thermodynamics of cloud droplets and the  rates of
              droplet growth and evaporation.  Automobile emissions of  olefins yield
              secondary organic aerosols such as glutaric, adipic  and phthalic acids, and
              a-pinene emissions from tree foliage  produce pinonaldehyde and pinonic acid
              upon oxidation.  Recent  experiments in this laboratory indicate that such
              difunctional  organic oxygenates are surface active and significantly alter the
               physical and chemical properties of the surface on an aqueous  solution
              droplet.  This proposal addresses the surface chemistry  and the effects of the
              surface chemistry on  evaporation/condensation rate processes of aerosol
              droplets  containing organic solutes.       Preliminary experiments with
              aqueous solution droplets of  adipic and phthalic acids show that evaporation
              rates are lowered  by more than an order of magnitude eompared with water
              droplets at  the same ambient conditions of temperature and relative humidity. 
               These large effects have not been explored before, but their impact  on cloud
              physics can be expected to be significant.       The work plan includes surface
              tension measurements of aqueous  solutions for a wide range of concentrations
              and  evaporation/condensation rate measurements of electrodynamically  trapped
              aerosol droplets.  The droplet size will be measured as a  function of time by
              light-scattering techniques, and the light-  scattering data will be analyzed
              to determine the refractive index  of the droplet.  Facilities are also
              available to Measure inelastic  scattering (Raman scattering) by the droplets,
              which can be used to  chemically characterize the droplets.  ***
