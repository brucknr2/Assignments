Abstract    :
              9321361  Rutledge       Collections of thunderstorms known as mesoscale
              convective  systems (MCS) are of scientific interest for a variety of reasons. 
               MCSs are a major source of rainfall and severe weather (including  lightning).
               In addition, they are believed to be important to the  vertical redistribution
              of atmospheric heating which is important  to global dynamics.  This research
              will focus on studying the  dynamical, thermodynamical and electrical
              properties of deep  convection. Both mid-latitude and tropical convection will
              be  studied using data from previously completed field campaigns.   Results of
              this research will increase knowledge of storm  electrification, especially the
              linkages between electrification,  cloud dynamics and mircrophysics.  The
              Principal Investigator will  continue ongoing studies on the structure of
              (MCSs) in both the  mid-latitudes and tropics.  Data from the new National
              Weather  Service Doppler Radars (WSR-88D) will be used to study the  structure
              and evolution of mid-latitude MCSs.
