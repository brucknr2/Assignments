Abstract    :
              9321821  Fan    This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research 
              in adaptive signal processing between Hong Fan of the University  of Cincinnati
              and Erlendur Karlsson of Uppsala University,  Uppsala, Sweden.  The objective
              of their research is to develop  and analyze adaptive filter algorithms based
              on the so-called  delta operator.  This "operator" is used in the fields of
              control  and system identification.    The delta operator or the difference
              operator has been introduced  to the field of automatic control.  It has
              numerical advantages  that have been observed in its implementation. The
              researchers  are proposing to apply it to adaptive signal processing. The U.S. 
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in adaptive  filtering. 
              This is complemented by the Swedish investigator's  considerable expertise in
              automatic control. His research group  is renown for their excellence in this
              field.  Their joint effort  will result in high performance adaptive filtering
              algorithms  which are useful for signal processing applications.   ***
