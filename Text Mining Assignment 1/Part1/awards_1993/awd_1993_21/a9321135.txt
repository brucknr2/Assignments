Abstract    :
              9321135  Andrews  This award is for support for a study to continue development
              of a  chronology, reconstruct paleoenvironments, and understand the  processes
              associated with major ice sheet instability (Heinrich  events) of the eastern
              sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet over the  last glacial cycle.  During the
              continental glaciation of North  America, Hudson Strait drained a quarter to a
              third of the  Laurentide Ice Sheet and was the major conduit for the transport
              of  water, sediment, and icebergs from the ice sheet into the North  Atlantic. 
              The fluxes of these materials into the Labrador Sea and  North Atlantic would
              have had a dramatic effect on the global  climate system.  A number of cores
              have been identified for study  that will provide high-resolution records of
              ice sheet (Heinrich)  events on centuries to decadal time scales.  ***
