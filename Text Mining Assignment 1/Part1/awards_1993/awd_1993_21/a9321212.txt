Abstract    :
              9321212  King    Located at the Harvard Government Data Center is an extremely
              detailed and extensive set of election data from numerous offices in electoral
              precincts in every state and the District of Columbia.  This project will make
              these data useful for academic purposes; specifically, the data will be cleaned
              and documented, supplemented with variables from the U.S. Census (such as race,
              income, occupation and education), and then made generally available to the
              scholarly community.  In addition, these data will be used to help solve an
              important problem in generalizing individual-level behavior from aggregate
              data.  ***
