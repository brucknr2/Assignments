Abstract    :
              9321261  Alley  This award is for support for a three year program to continue
              the physical properties measurements and dating of the Greenland Ice Sheet
              Project Two (GISP2) ice core, reconstruct accumulation rates, and jointly
              interpret the accumulation rate, contaminant and isotopic records.  Dating of
              the GISP2 ice core has relied most heavily on visible strata, although other
              indicators have been critical.  Flow discontinuities in the deeper part of the
              GISP2 core could invalidate the climate record obtained there.  It is thus
              critical to know at what depth the climate record becomes suspect. 
              Fortunately, flow discontinuities have a physical signature that may be
              detected by study of the size, shape, and arrangement of grains and their c
              axes using optical and sonic techniques.  Physical data are also important in
              ice flow modeling for dating of the deep ice core and for understanding any
              past and future changes in the ice sheet.  ***
