Abstract    :
              9321087  Durrett       This award will support the development of software for 
              simulating stochastic spatial models, such as those found in  ecology. 
              Interacting particle systems, a vigorous area in  probability theory, have a
              structure that makes them appropriate  to the development of ecosystems.  Their
              use as models is impeded  by the fact that the mathematical theory is not easy
              to read and  understand.  To bridge the gap between theory and applications 
              the project will develop software to allow biologist interested  in using these
              models to learn about existing results and to  simulate and analyze their own
              models.  ***
