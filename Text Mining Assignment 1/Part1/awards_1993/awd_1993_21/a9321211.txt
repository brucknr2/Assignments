Abstract    :
                      9321211  Rodman    Animal vocalizations (growls, screeches, grunts, and
              so forth) have been studied by scientists from two perspectives - 1) regarding
              them as manifestations of emotional arousal of an animal that at best convey a
              notion of what the animal might do, and 2) seeing them as communicating
              specific information about 'objects' in the environment, and hence functionally
              equivalent to some human words (warning calls, "here's the food", etc.). 
              Virtually absent, however, has been the consideration of vocalizations as
              functioning to communicate information about the identity of the animal, or
              what linguists refer to as the indexical function of language.  It is clear
              that non-vocal identifiers are important, such as olfactory cues.  For
              primates, however, except for long-distance chimpanzee calls, there has been
              very little study in this area.    This 14 month field study will investigate
              the ability of rhesus macaques to recognize each other's vocalizations on the
              island of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico.  The research is designed to test
              explicit hypotheses concerning the presence and nature of unique vocal 
              'signatures', and the level at whcih they facilitate vocal recognition of group
              members.          The results of this study will contribute to an understanding
              of the social functions of primate vocal communication.  They will also yield
              insight into the cognitive processes by which primates recognize conspecifics
              and group them into meaningful social categories that can guide behavioral
              decision-making.  ***
