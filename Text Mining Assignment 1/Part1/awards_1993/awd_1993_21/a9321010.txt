Abstract    :
              9321010  McKibbin  The purpose of this project is to extend and refine a 
              multicountry economic model to explore the consequences of  regional and global
              environmental policies that might be used to  control global climate change. 
              This model will be extended in  several ways.  First, greater attention will be
              paid to the  treatment of developing countries.  Second, the model will be 
              improved by moving to a more flexible econometric specification.   Third, a
              wide range of unilateral and multilateral global warming  control policies will
              be analyzed, with particular emphasis on  the effect of policies such as trade
              in carbon intensive goods.   Forth, China will be treated in greater detail,
              separate from  other developing countries.  Fifth, a general framework for 
              modeling non-renewable resources will be developed in order to  analyze how
              constraints on the availability of fossil fuels would  affect carbon emissions
              and the development of alternative energy  sources.  Sixth, a set of baseline
              forecasts will be generated  regarding carbon dioxide emissions under a variety
              of alternative  assumptions such as population growth and technological change
              in  different regions.  ***
