Abstract    :
              9321407  Nishiizumi  This award supports a program to measure Beryllium-10,
              Aluminum-26, and Chlorine-36 in samples from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project
              Two (GISP2) ice core.  A continuous profile of cosmogenic nuclide
              concentrations from the surface to the bottom of the core will be measured and
              the resulting time series of nuclide concentrations will be applied to deducing
              the history of solar activity, deducing the history of variations in the
              geomagnetic field and dating of ice cores.  The time series will also be used
              to study climatic history through the effects of atmospheric circulation and of
              atmospheric chemistry on nuclide deposition.  The successful coring of the
              sub-ice bedrock has also provided the opportunity of studying the exposure age
              of the sub-ice surface.  ***
