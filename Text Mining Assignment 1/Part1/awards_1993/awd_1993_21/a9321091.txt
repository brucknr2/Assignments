Abstract    :
              Expected utility (EU) models are the cornerstone of the economic  approach to
              modeling decision making under uncertainty.  These  models perform poorly,
              however, in describing decision making  under a number of real-world
              conditions.  Non-expected utility  models have been developed to address the
              shortcomings of the  conventional approach.  Modeling and empirical use of
              non-EU  models are currently constrained because it is believed these  models
              violate desirable behavioral properties.  This research  will analyze the
              validity of those beliefs.  Non-EU models will  be applied to dynamic choice
              situations.  The investigators will  explore families of non-EU models that
              maintain the property of  dynamic consistency in these situations.  The results
              are  expected to broaden the application of non-EU models to a wide  range of
              modeling environments.
