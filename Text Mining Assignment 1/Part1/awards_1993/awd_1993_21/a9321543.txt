Abstract    :
              This research, funded by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry  
              Program, treats two topics in the theory of state-to-state reaction   dynamics.
               First, hydrogen atom exchange in heavy-light-heavy-atom   systems is treated
              by quantum or semi-classical (phase space) dynamics.    Second, scattering
              resonances will be computed by Fourier analysis of   high energy quantum
              wavepackets evolving in the transition state region.    A complex gas phase
              reaction consists of many elementary steps such as   O+HCl = OH+Cl occurring
              sequentially or in parallel. The first research   topic is the development of
              mathematical methods for predicting the rate   of such an elementary reaction,
              in particular, one involving the transfer   of a hydrogen atom from one heavy
              atom to another.  The theory treats the   dependence of the reaction rate upon
              the initial relative translational   energy of the reactants and the
              vibrational and rotational quantum states   of the reactants and products.  In
              the course of a chemical reaction the   molecular system usually passes through
              a high energy configuration known   as the transition state.  The second
              research topic attempts to follow   the behavior of a molecular system which
              starts out in the transition   state region.  One way to prepare molecules in
              this initial condition in   the laboratory is to first generate a stable
              negative complex ion having   (approximately) the appropriate geometry, and
              then suddenly remove one   electron by laser excitation (photodetachment).  One
               goal of this   research project is to develop the theory of these
              photodetachment   experiments.
