Abstract    :
              9321929  Scott  This action concerns the use of scale models to investigate the 
              response of geotechnical structures (earth dams, embankments,  building
              foundations, etc.) to earthquake-induced strong-ground  motions.  In
              particular, the possibility of using a scale model  mounted on a shake table to
              simulate the earthquake response of a  full-scale geotechnical structure is
              being investigated through  this exploratory study.    If this 1g (normal
              gravity loading) experimental technique  fulfills its promise, it will effect
              two areas.  First, the  potential impact is large for industry, because the
              lower cost of  1g tests in comparison with experiments performed on a 
              geotechnical centrifuge (approximately 25% to 40% lower) will  improve the
              access to physical modeling by practicing  geotechnical earthquake engineers;
              resulting in a substantial  advance in industry practice.  The second impact is
              to centrifuge  experiments.  The new scaling relations will permit the current 
              maximum capacities of centrifuges to be overcome to that the need  for larger
              and more costly centrifuges is reduced.    This research program combines
              experiments and analytical studies  to compare with the experiments, in order
              to investigate scaling  relations.  Particular emphasis is placed on pore
              fluids and the  dynamic environment, motivated by the need to resolve some 
              concerns regarding the appropriateness of the scaling relations  currently used
              for centrifuge studies.  ***
