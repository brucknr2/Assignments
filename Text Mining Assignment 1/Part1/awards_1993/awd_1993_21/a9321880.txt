Abstract    :
              9321930  BRANSCOMB  This project is Phase 2 of a three-phase project to study
              the  science and technology policy support available to state  legislatures
              and, in cooperation with legislators, to explore  alternative models for
              meeting their needs.  In Phase 1 (not  supported by NSF) of this study,
              conducted during the spring of  1993 at the John F. Kennedy School of
              Government, the investigators  surveyed 50 state legislatures and received 100
              percent response.   This high level of interest suggests that the issue is both
               important and timely; it does not suggest that the state  legislative bodies
              are well supported and do not need to be  exploring affordable and practical
              alternatives for improving their  capabilities.  At stake is the legitimacy of
              state government and  the accountability of technical experts who may be
              advocates,  critics, or advisors.  Phase 2 involves the on-site study of 6 to 
              10 selected states to provide a valid basis for evaluation of the  need for S&T
              support and the adequacy of current resources.  A  conference will be convened
              to review recommendations from which  one or more model legislative-support
              structures will be designed.   The final stage, which the investigators will
              fund from non-NSf  sources, will be the implementation of the model in one or
              more  states.
