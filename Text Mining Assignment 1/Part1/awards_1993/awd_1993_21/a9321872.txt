Abstract    :
              9321872  Phillips  The overall objective of the project is the successful use of
              detectors for x ray crystallography. This will be accomplished by (a) the
              development of a modular CCD based x ray detector designed to collect data from
              protein crystals at wiggler beam lines at the National Synchrotron Light
              Source, and (b) research on detector technology for x ray crystallography. This
              project has four main components: (1 ) design and construction of the detector,
              (2) characterization of the performance of the detector, (3) installation of
              the detector and data collection at beamlines X21 and/or X25, and (4) research
              on detector hardware and on methods for using detectors for x ray diffraction. 
                This detector will be capable of recording diffraction patterns accurately at
              the highest fluxes available at synchrotron beam lines. The detector includes
              software for control and data analysis. Major features of the detector include:
                  SYMBOL 215 \f "Symbol"  A Modular Design: The detector is assembled from an
              array of 4 modular units. Each unit has an active area of ~100x100mm square.
              The 4 modules form an area of 200x200 mm with ~2000x2000 pixels.     SYMBOL 215
              \f "Symbol"  Interchangeable Modules: Modules can be quickly interchanged,
              allowing the rapid replacement of a defective module with a minimum loss of
              beam time.     SYMBOL 215 \f "Symbol"  High Performance: The dynamic range is
              >4x104; and the DQE ~0.7.     SYMBOL 215 \f "Symbol"  Optimization for
              Synchrotron Operation: The dead time between successive images (readout time)
              is 0.8 seconds. Pixel binning can be used for faster readout and/or more
              efficient data r educ tion and data storage.     SYMBOL 215 \f "Symbol"  High
              Reliability and Stability: The x ray converter and CCD sensor are directly
              coupled using a fib eroptic taper demagnifier, eliminating the need for image
              intensifiers and lenses.     SYMBOL 215 \f "Symbol"  Fabrication from Multi
              Sourced Components: The programmable, low noise electronics are capa ble of
              operating with many types of CCDs; the fiberoptic tapers and CCDs are available
              from sever al sources; a VME system and a UNlX based computer will be used for
              data acquisition and detec tor control.     SYMBOL 215 \f "Symbol"  Software;
              All routines necessary for detector calibration and control will be integrated
              into a graphi cally oriented package. A modified version of MADNES will be used
              for oscillation data collection.    An extensive characterization of the
              detector's performance will be carried out in order to deter mine (a) how best
              to use the detector for data collection and (b) how to advance detector
              technolo gy. The characteristics of each of the components used, and of new
              components, will be studied in order to enhance the performance of this
              detector and future detectors. Studies will be carried out to determine how
              measurements made with this type of detector influence the molecular struc
              tures derived from the detector data. Mathematical methods for deconvoluting
              data will be developed in order to improve the accuracy of intensity
              measurements made with x ray crystallography detectors.    This project will
              complement a proposal that has been submitted to the Department of Energy,
              Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) by the Brookhaven National
              Laboratory Biology Department. The Brookhaven proposal will provide ancillary
              hardware to complete a working beamline data collection facility for protein
              crystallography at the National Laboratory National Syn chrotron Light Source.
              The OHER project will provide a diffractometer on which to mount the detector,
              a motorized lift table for alignment of the diffractomet er, control
              instruments for these components, data reduction computers and substantial mass
              storage devices, and sufficient per sonnel to operate the instrument as a
              facility for inexperienced outside users. The detector will be installed as the
              principal instrument of the facility. The facility will be built to be mobile
              so that it can be used with any of the wiggler or dipole beamlines at the
              National Synchrotron Light Source. A goal will be to provide projects of
              sufficient scientific quality that the instrument will be in use for a major
              fraction of the time.           ~CRD3809TMP           YMx       ~CAL165BTMP
