Abstract    :
              9321294  Jewitt    Dr. Jewitt will conduct a concentrated program of direct and 
              coronagraphic imaging of the split comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 prior to and  during
              its encounter with Jupiter in July 1994.  Optical images of the  comet will be
              used to study the morphological and photometric changes  induced by
              gravitational stresses from Jupiter, as well as changes caused  by passage
              through the inner magnetosphere.  Images of the sunlit face  of the planet will
              be used to record changes produced there by the  impacts.  The observations
              exploit the fine-seeing, low-scattering optical  environment on Mauna Kea,
              Hawaii, and utilize an existing  coronagraphic/CCD system.
