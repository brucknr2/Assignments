Abstract    :
              Within a democratic society, risk management policies need to be  guided by
              public attitudes, perceptions, and preferences.  A  national survey effort can
              play a crucial role in helping  decision makers in government and industry
              understand and  appreciate citizens' views.  Toward the objective, the project 
              will design a prototype for a national survey covering a wide  range of
              risk-related topics including risk perceptions,  comparative evaluations of
              societal, technological,  environmental, and health risks, and attitudes and
              opinions about  risk management policies and strategies.  The research will 
              address questions about demographic characteristics, economic  status,
              worldviews, and political values.  The design of the  prototype instrument will
              be the responsibility of Decision  Research with the assistance of personnel
              from the Survey  Research Center of the University of Maryland and an Advisory 
              Committee.  The survey instrument will be designed to allow  researchers to
              develop and test theories and models of decision  making pertaining to a wide
              range of societal risk issues, public  policy formulation, and analysis.
