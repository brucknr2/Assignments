Abstract    :
              9321065  Krugman  This research will develop models on the spatial structure  of
              urban systems, with the emphasis on the forces leading to  uneven development;
              and the role of the geographic  clustering of industries in trade. The
              theoretical work  builds on models of imperfectly competitive markets to draw 
              out the tensions between the set of attractive forces that  lead to the
              clustering of particular industries at regional  centers, and the repulsive
              forces that limit the size of  such concentrations. It is expected that the
              modeling would  explain the hierarchial structure of cities with higher-  order
              cities engaged in the production of goods and services  that reflect greater
              economies of scale or lower transport  costs. The empirical research will use
              data on Mexican  manufacturing to test the effects of, for example, NAFTA on 
              Mexican urban systems. The models on industry clustering are  used to study
              whether regional economic integration in  Europe will promote a greater degree
              of industrial  concentration.  This project is of significant interest because
              it attempts  to link international trade and interregional development 
              patterns. The results from the study promise to give us a  better understanding
              of the internal geography of major  urban areas as well as the adjustment
              issues raised by  economic integration prospects in Europe.  ***
