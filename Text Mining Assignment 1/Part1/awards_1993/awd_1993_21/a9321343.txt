Abstract    :
              The Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) has recovered an ice  core from
              central Greenland covering a time that extends at least  100,000 years before
              present.  The high accumulation rate at the  site makes it an ideal record for
              studying climate mechanisms and  variability.  The electrical conductivity,
              which is a function of  the acid/base balance of the ice, has been measured
              continuously  along the core and provides the highest time resolution of the 
              many measurements which have been made on the core. The existing  conductivity
              record will be interpreted in conjunction with other  records.  Specific goals
              are; 1) Investigation of decadal and  century scale climate change, 2) Develop
              a chronology of volcanic  activity record in the GISP2 core, 3) Improve the
              understanding  of ice flow in the Summit region, 4) Improve the dating and 
              accumulation record of the GISP2 core, and 5) Develop a  chronology of northern
              hemisphere biomass burning as recorded by  the GISP2 core.  The GISP2 is a
              component of the NSF Arctic  System Science Program.
