Abstract    :
              9321573  Ober  Thermotropic main-chain polyethers will be prepared in both 
              deuterated and undeuterated forms as model polymers for the  investigation of
              diffusion behavior in liquid crystalline (LC)  polymer melts.  The target
              polymers will be prepared with a range  of persistence lengths with
              sufficiently high molecular weights  to form entangled melts in the isotropic
              state.  The mesophase  properties of these polymers will be evaluated.  Forward
              recoil  spectrometry (FRES) will be sued to determine the concentration 
              profiles of these interdiffusing LC polymer chains.  Small-angle  neutron
              scattering will be used to determine the anisotropy ratio  of the radius of
              gyration and the persistence length.  Branched  LC polymers will be prepared by
              endlinking chains.  Collaborations with industrial scientists are planned,
              which will  further characterize these thermotropic polymers using  rheological
              measurements.  The fundamental information derived  from these studies will be
              useful for providing a better  fundamental understanding of the melt properties
              of LC polymers.  ***
