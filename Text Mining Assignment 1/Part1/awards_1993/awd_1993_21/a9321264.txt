Abstract    :
              9321264  Saeks  This project will develop a hybrid frequency domain/neurocontrol
              algorithm by using neural network techniques to adjust the "Youla design
              parameter."  This yields a controller which is guaranteed to be stable and can
              implement any of and /or distrubance rejection, pole placement, robust tracking
              and/or disturbance rejection, simultaneous design, initial value design, etc. 
              The adaptivity and robustness intrinsic to neurocontrol is integerated into the
               frequency domain controller.  Powerful (ontogenic) neural network training
              techniques may be brought to bare on the control system design problem allowing
              one to design a controller without a prior restrictions on its order.  A
              reconfigurable control architecture is developed where the controller is
              trained to deal with multiple scenarios; alternative trajectories for a flight
              controller, varying loads on a robot arm, alternative current waveshapes in a
              power supply, etc; generaliziang to new scencarios byond the training set where
              necessary.  The approach is directly applicable to linear multivariate systems
              and extendable, via the vairous generalizations of the Youla parameterization
              to the nonlinear case.   ***   v       s  t
