Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Michigan State U in the purchase of
              a quantum chemical  visualization system.  Specific areas of research include: 
              (1)  Simulations of Excess Electrons  in Condensed Matter; (2) Modeling the
              Structure and Properties of Complex Biological  Membrane Systems; (3) Magnetic
              Materials from Ionophoric Organic Radicals; (4) The  Electronic and Geometric
              Structure of Diatomic and Small Polyatomic Molecules  Containing a First
              Transition Series Element; and (5) Structure and Properties of 
              Lipopolysaccharides.    The computer hardware and software in the quantum
              mechanical visualization system allows one  to simulate interactions that take
              place in molecules in a real laboratory environment and to  present these
              interactions in a visual manner.
