Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a two year continuing grant to  study the
              cosmogenic in-situ carbon-14  trapped in the GISP2  core.  Total amounts of
              carbon-14 activities in the carbon  monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2)
              phases will be  studied using previously developed techniques.  New  techniques
              will be developed for the measurements of carbon  dioxide concentrations in ice
              using wet and dry extraction  methods and of carbon-14 activities using a dry
              extraction  procedure.  By studying the total carbon-14 activities in  ice
              samples of known age information on the dependence of  retention of both
              atmospheric carbon dioxide and in-situ  carbon-14 activities on the ambient
              temperatures will be  determined.  The proposed studies will provide an
              algorithm  for using the hybrid carbon-14 chronometer (hybrid because 
              carbon-14 is derived from two sources), and should allow  accurate carbon-14
              dating of other ice cores.
