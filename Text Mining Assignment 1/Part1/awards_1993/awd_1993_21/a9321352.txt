Abstract    :
                    PANEL SUMMARY  CTS-9411588  University of South Carolina at Columbia  P.
              I.:  Michael A. Mathews      The goals for each project were unclear.  The
              proposal was oriented too much towards words the equipment and not enough
              towards the breakthroughs which may result from                                
                          the projects themselves.  The Instrument is innovative and
              relatively uncommon.  The PI has good experience with this type of equipment.  
               The educational component was exceptional, probably the best of all the
              proposals in the competition.    There is a lot of promise here and this could
              be funded in the future if the projects could be explained in more detail. 
              Explain breakthroughs that could result.
