Abstract    :
              9321424  Hummel  This Research Planning Grant (RPG) proposal seeks funding for
              the  preliminary investigation and initial performance data collection  of the
              PI's approach to dynamic loop scheduling on multiprocessor  system, termed as
              "fractiling".  The approach combines  "factoring", based on workload
              distribution of each loop  iteration with tiling which distributes loop
              iterations to  available processor resources.  Each processor executes its
              local  tile in subtiles, whose sizes are globally determined by  factoring
              rules.  The simplicity of the factoring rule used  allows the common tiling
              rules to be applied recursively to  locally selected shapes (tiles).  If a
              processor finishes its  tile early, the processor obtains additional tiles. 
              This  techniques retains the load balancing properties of factoring and  the
              data reuse properties of tiling.    During the RPG, the PI proposes to develop
              and implement a simple  prototype of fractiling technique on two parallel
              machines, BBN  GP100 and CM5.  ***
