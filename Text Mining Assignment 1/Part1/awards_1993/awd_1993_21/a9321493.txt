Abstract    :
                Proposal #: 93-21493    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V MOANA WAVE, a 213 foot vessel, which is owned by the Navy
              and operated by the University in support of oceanographic research. 
              Instrumentation requested includes a water sampling rosette system, an ARGOS
              receiver, two transmissometers, refubishment of two gyroscopes, a pinger, an
              altimeter, computer hardware, and a radioisotope van.  The instrumentation
              requested is required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the MOANA WAVE
              during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the
              future.
