Abstract    :
              9321164  Stuiver  This award is for support to complete the oxygen isotope
              determinations of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core at 1.0
              meter and 0.2 meter resolution.  The relative importance of central Greenland
              temperature change versus ocean source temperature change will be investigated
              (in cooperation with J.W.C. White, University of Colorado, Boulder) by
              calculating the deuterium excess of these samples.  In addition, the phase
              relationships between oxygen isotope patterns and changes in accumulation rate,
              ice chemistry, dust content, and atmospheric trace gases will be determined. 
              The climatic and environmental significance of the ice core record will be
              assessed and the spatial and temporal variability of the isotope record will
              determined.  ***
