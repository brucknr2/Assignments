Abstract    :
              9321667  Chronwall    The purpose of the Fifteenth Winter Neuropeptide
              Conference is to  encourage experts and young scientists in the expanding field
              of  peptide research to discuss recent findings related to "Models of  Peptide
              Action."  The topics range from behavioral aspects to basic  mechanisms of
              action, passage of peptide across the brain blood  barrier,cytokines,
              neurotrophism and development.  In addition, a  plenary presentation and a
              poster session will be included.  It is  anticipated that 80-120 participants
              from all over the US as well  as Europe and Japan will attend.  ***
