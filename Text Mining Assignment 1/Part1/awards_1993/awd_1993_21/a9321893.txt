Abstract    :
              9321893  Hartzell  The carbon source requirements of all known methanogens are
              limited to simple C1 and C2 compounds such as CO2, methanol, formate, and
              acetate despite the fact that methanogenesis from higher molecular weight
              carbon sources would be sufficiently exergonic for growth.  Current anaerobic
              digestion processes for methane production involve three basic steps:
              solubilization, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis.  These processes are carried
              out by different microbial consortia with different pH optima.  The goal of
              this project is to engineer a microbe capable of methanogenesis from complex
              substrates.  This will improve the rate and efficiency of anaerobic digestion
              processes for methane production.  The organism, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, is an
              extremely thermophilic (83 degrees C) sulfate-reducing Archaeon that grows on a
              broad range of carbon sources including peptone, starch, and gelatin.  A.
              fulgidus has been referred to as "the evolutionary missing link" between the
              methanogens and the sulfate metabolizers as it utilizes all but the final
              enzymes involved in methanogenesis. In this exploratory project, both
              mutation/selection strategies and gene transfer techniques are being used to
              create a broad-substrate-range methanogen from A. fulgidus.  %%%  Success in
              genetically engineering Archaeolglobus should lead to a major improvement in
              the rate and efficiency of production of methane, a desirable energy source.
