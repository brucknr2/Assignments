Abstract    :
              9321363  Kossler    Technical abstract:  Static and dynamic fields in high
              temperature  superconductors (HTS) will be studied both theoretically and 
              experimentally by new extension of muon spin rotation (muonSR)  techniques. 
              Nearly all muonSR work in HTS to date has focused on  transverse magnetic field
              measurements.  The new development in  this work will allow use of the
              longitudinal field technique even  though the average internal field is neither
              along nor  perpendicular to the beam axis.  This technique will be used to 
              detect small internal fields, which are perpendicular to the  average magnetic
              field.  Experiments will be compared to the  theoretically determined tilt
              disorder induced by the transverse  field distributions.  Data on internal
              field correlation times will  be used to develop models for this motion which
              will aid to  understand the disordered vortex lattice melting process.   
              Non-technical abstract:  Magnetic fields enter high temperature 
              superconductors along axes of vortices.  Ideally these vortices are  straight
              and arranged in regular patterns.  However, in reality  these vortices tilt,
              flex, and move out of regular positions.  The  static and dynamic disorder of
              these vortices needs to be  understood because they contribute to energy losses
              in these  superconductors.  Such losses in turn have detrimental effects on 
              potential superconducting devices such as high field magnets or  electrical
              transmission lines.  The nature of the vortex order,  tilt, and motion will be
              studied both theoretically and  experimentally.  The experimental technique
              uses the elementary  particle called a muon to sense the local magnetic
              environment in  the superconductor.  ***
