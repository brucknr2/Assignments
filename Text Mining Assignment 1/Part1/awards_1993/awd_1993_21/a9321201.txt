Abstract    :
              9321201  Liu  The proposal is to explore experimentally the rich phase behavior 
              exhibited in a confined colloidal suspension, a monodisperse  ferrofluid
              (oil-in-water) emulsion.  An externally applied magnetic  field induces a large
              magnetic moment in each droplet, leading to  a transition of the suspension
              from a fluid-like phase to a more  ordered phase.  The various phases can
              consist of separated chains,  ordered columns, or a complex labyrinthine
              pattern.  The evolution  of the structure that forms, and its dependence on
              various key  parameters will be investigated.  These field induced structures 
              dramatically modify the viscosity of the fluid, making this system  an ideal
              model for a magnetorheological fluid.  Thus the results  are expected to lead
              to new insight into the fascinating phase  behavior of these systems and
              provide guidelines for making  technologically important materials with
              fundamentally new  properties.  %%%  The proposal is to experimentally explore
              the phase behavior of a  suspension of small droplets of oil immersed in water.
               Each oil  droplet is uniform in size and contains thousands of tiny floating 
              magnets.  An externally applied magnetic field reorients the tiny  magnets so
              that each droplet acts like a big magnet.  This causes  the droplets to line up
              into chains such that the suspension  undergoes a phase transition.  These
              field-induced new phases  modify the viscosity of the fluid dramatically,
              turning the liquid  into a solid which may lead to the development of actively 
              controlled shock absorbers and clutches for cars or robotic joint  controls. 
              This research is to study the field-induced structural  change of these systems
              and to provide guidelines for making  technologically important materials with
              fundamentally new  properties.  ***
