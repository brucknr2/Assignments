Abstract    :
              9321556  Van der Veen  This award is for support for a study on the mechanics of
              Columbia  Glacier, Alaska, USA during its current rapid retreat.  The 
              extensive data set of surface elevations and velocities obtained  from many
              repeat aerial photogrammetries of the glacier will be  analyzed in order to
              identify the sites of, and magnitudes of  mechanical controls on the lower part
              of the glacier.  This data  will also provide information to help determine
              whether the ongoing  retreat is associated with a major change in flow style,
              and to  test various calving relations at each phase of retreat of the ice 
              front.  The understanding of the controls of the collapse of the  Columbia
              Glacier, obtained from these data, will be very helpful in  understanding major
              collapses of other glaciers.  ***
