Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry
              Program, extends the principal investigator's recent   development of
              semiclassical approximations to treat the time evolution   of quantum
              mechanical systems such as tunneling and other classically   forbidden
              processes.   A large sample of classical trajectories is   generated and used
              to compute the Van Vleck-Gutwiller propagator by   integrating over initial
              momenta by the cellular method.  Four specific   topics will be studied:  (1)
              fundamental aspects of the theory, (2)   applications to atomic and molecular
              scattering, spectroscopy, and   reactive scattering, (3) processes governed by
              small Franck-Condon   factors, and (4) multiple scattering of electrons off
              surfaces with   applications to the theory of scanning tunneling microscopy.   
              This fundamental theoretical research project attempts to incorporate the  
              essential quantum mechanical features of molecular dynamics into a   simpler
              classical mechanical formalism.  The theory, still in the early   stages of
              development, has a very wide range of potential application.    This project
              further develops fundamental aspects of the theory, and   explores applications
              to molecular spectroscopy, elementary chemical   reactions, and to the theory
              of scanning tunneling microscopy.
