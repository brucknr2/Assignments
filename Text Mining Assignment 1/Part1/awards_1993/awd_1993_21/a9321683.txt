This project involves a cultural anthropologist
              studying the changing relationship between Islamic legal institutions, civil
              courts, and customary law procedures in Indonesia. Indonesia is the largest
              Muslim society in the world. Using ethnographic techniques of intensive
              interviews and participant observation as well as reviewing court cases, the
              project will study the shift away from local customary law procedures towards
              more universalist Islamic legal code. The universalist rules clash with local
              values around the important theme of inheritance, and this brief project will
              focus on a community first studied by the anthropologist in 1978 to see how
              local authorities deal with the problem. By understanding how the local
              community reacts to the religious-legal proscriptions of the central national
              authorities, this project will provide important information about the
              abilities of Islamic society to adapt to changing local circumstances.
              Increased understanding of Islamic local diversity and reactions to change will
              better enable our society to deal with Muslims.
