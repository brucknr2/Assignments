Abstract    :
              9321388  Greenberg  This research seeks to determine good interconnection
              networks and routing schemes for massively parallel computers of the future. 
              Such networks must have modestly increasing hardware requirements as the number
              of processors increases but also must efficiently support general patterns of
              communication.  Hardware cost will be measured by using models that account for
              real-world constraints such as pin-out and wiring area rather than more naive
              component counting.  Particular attention will be given to ensuring that
              general-purpose communication capabilities hold up even when interprocessor
              distances are large and when faults are introduced.  This work will employ both
              mathematical proof and simulation of proposed networks.  The identification of
              a superior interconnection network can increase the programmer's flexibility. 
              On one hand, machine-independent programs should be fairly efficiently
              executable.  On the other hand,  programs that choose to exploit specifics of
              the interconnection network will be more portable and scalable given a robust
              interconnection scheme that can be retained as the number of processors grows.
