Abstract    :
              This proposed research represents an effort to understand  methods in
              nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in terms of  ergodic theory and dynamical
              systems theory.  This  connection will be studied using model systems which are
               sufficiently complex to be ergodic and mixing but  sufficiently simple to
              permit an analytic treatment,  supplemented by computer studies, when
              necessary.  ***
