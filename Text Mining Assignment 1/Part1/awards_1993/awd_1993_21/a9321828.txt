Abstract    :
              9321828  Vilgalys  It has been suggested that mutualistic associations between
              distantly related organisms can lead to the beginning of new phyla and may have
              been instrumental in the colonization of land by plants.  The highly
              speculative content of the arguments supporting these hypotheses has led to
              much controversy.  This project will undertake empirical studies of the
              evolutionary role of mutualism by studying a group of basidiomycete fungi,
              species in the genus Omphalina and its relatives.  This group is well suited
              for evolutionary studies of mutualistic associations because it includes
              closely related saprophytic (i.e. non-mutualistic) and mutualistic species
              (those associating with algae to form lichens), suggesting that the transition
              to a mutualistic state might be relatively recent (Lutzoni and Vilgalys, 1993).
              In this study, both morphological and molecular characters will be utilized to
              infer the phylogeny or relationships of species of Omphalina to each other, as
              well as investigating the relationships of this genus to other groups.  These
              first results will be utilized to test hypotheses concerning features involved
              in changing to a mutualistic/lichen forming life style.  %%%  This model system
              will address important questions concerning the possible mutualistic
              association of different organisms (in this case, fungi with algae to form
              lichens) leading to new life forms.
