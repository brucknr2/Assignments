Abstract    :
              9321943  Jones    The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Research Experiences
              for  Undergraduates (REU) Program offers talented undergraduate  students,
              interested in a career in the physical sciences, the  opportunity to work with
              a scientist for ten weeks during the  summer at the Center for Astrophysics
              (CfA) in Cambridge,  Massachusetts.  Approximately one dozen students are
              recruited  nationally with emphasis on encouraging women, minority students 
              and students from colleges where research opportunities are  limited, to apply.
                 Student research projects will be designed by CfA scientists in  nearly
              every branch of astro-physics.  Program activities also  include field trips to
              nearby observatories, informal get-togethers  to discuss projects, social
              events, lunch time seminars on general  astronomical topics and a symposium at
              the end of the summer where  students will give a short talk about their
              research project.
