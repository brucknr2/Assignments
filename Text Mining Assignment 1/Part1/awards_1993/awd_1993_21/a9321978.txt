Abstract    :
              9321978  Debenedetti    The supercritical fluid antisolvent (SAS) technique is a
              novel  and promising method of forming small particles of polymeric and 
              biological materials.  We propose to explore the direct  microencapsulation of
              protein particles in a bioerodible  polymeric matrix by SAS processing.  These
              composite  microparticles can be ideal vehicles for the controlled release  of
              peptides and proteins.  We have recently demonstrated the  viability of
              producing dry, pure, and biologically-active  polypeptide microparticles by
              SAS.  We now propose to study the  feasibility of incorporating these
              polypeptides directly into a  bioerodible polymer matrix using SAS processing. 
              Model systems  to be tested are insulin and leutinising hormone - releasing 
              hormone (proteins), dimethylsulfoxide (organic solvent),  supercritical CO2
              (antisolvent), and bioerodible polyesters  (polymer matrix).  The biological
              activity, peptide release  rate, and peptide conformation will be investigated
              as a  function processing condition.  Changes in SAS processing  conditions
              will be investigated so as to fine-tune the size and  distribution of these
              microparticles for specific drug delivery  systems.  If successful, the
              proposed research can lead to  solvent-free, biologically active composite
              microparticles in a  single processing step.  This would represent a
              breakthrough in  the quest for efficient means of delivering therapeutic
              peptides  and proteins.  ***
