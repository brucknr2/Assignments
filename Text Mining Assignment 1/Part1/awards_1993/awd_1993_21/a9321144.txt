Abstract    :
              Tekalp  9321144      This award will support collaborative research between the 
              University of Rochester and Bilkent University, Ankara,  Turkey.  The
              investigators will study novel techniques for  model-based very low bit rate
              digital video compression.  They propose to concentrate on the model-based
              paradigm of 3-  D flexible object models and 3-D motion, using a flexible 
              generic wireframe model as a structural constraint for head  and shoulder type
              scenes which are common in videophone  applications.  Due to the ill-posed
              nature of 3-D motion and  structure estimation in the case of monocular
              imaging, they  also propose to investigate the feasibility of stereo  imaging
              in videophone applications where stereo imaging  techniques can be used to
              estimate 3-D motion and structure  parameters for model-based coding.  This
              project coincides  with international standardization activities.    The
              proposed research project forms part of the fabric of  current scientific
              interest in video compression and the  successful completion of this
              international collaboration  will benefit the electrical engineering
              communities in both  the U.S. and Turkey.  ***      I:eom\abstekalp.eom
