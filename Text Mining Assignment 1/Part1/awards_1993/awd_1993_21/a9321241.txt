Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to examine a series of disjoint biradicals   by
              chemical and spectroscopic methods. Molecular orbital calculations   have
              predicted that disjoint biradicals will possess a singlet ground   state.
              Previous work from this laboratory has resulted in finding a   triplet ground
              state disjoint biradical. This contradiction of theory   will be pursued
              further with new examples which have rigidly defined   structures for
              comparison to theoretical calculations. Non-alternant   biradicals will be
              explored, which contain in some fashion,   cyclopentadiene rings. The interplay
              between structure and multiplicity   of these biradicals will be explored,
              where lower membered systems are   expected to be singlets and higher membered
              systems triplets.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
              continuing work   of Professor Paul Dowd at the University of Pittsburgh. The
              chemical and   spectroscopic properties of a novel series of reactive
              intermediates   known as biradicals will be examined. Biradicals are molecules
              where   there are an odd number of electron at two sites. For example, in a  
              hydrocarbon biradical, two carbon atoms will each be bonded to three   other
              carbon atoms and have one unbonded electron.  The two odd electrons   may have
              spins paired (a singlet) or unpaired (a triplet). The lowest   energy states
              (singlet or triplet) of the biradicals will be determined   experimentally as a
              function of structure. These results will be compared   to theoretical
              calculations.
