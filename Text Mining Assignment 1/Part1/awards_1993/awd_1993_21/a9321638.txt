Abstract    :
              9321638  Bramble    This is a comparative morphological study that addresses the
               functional relationships between thoracic design and locomotor  behavior among
              highly cursorial, moderately cursorial, and non-  cursorial members of the
              order Lagomorpha (hares, cottontails,  and pikas). A novel approach will be
              take to understand the  functional morphology of the thoracic complex: the
              mechanical  role of the lungs and the interaction of lungs, heart, and ribs, 
              during locomotion will be examined. A previously unexplored  function of the
              lungs within the thorax will be modeled:  pneumatic stabilization. This study
              will test the hypothesis that  lungs, in addition to their role as gas
              exchangers, may act as  pneumatic stabilizers of the chest walls and heart and
              that this  mechanism will be positively correlated with running ability. A 
              model will be developed which describes the integrated function  of the
              mammalian thoracic complex during exercise based on the  morphology, material
              properties, and mechanical interactions of  its constituent elements. High
              speed cineradiographic analysis  will be used in dynamic tests of both cadavers
              and live rabbits  in order to describe the interactions of elements of the
              thoracic  complex and to test essential predictions of the pneumatic 
              stabilization model.  ***
