Abstract    :
                       9321094       Shellhamer            This grant from the Organic
              Dynamics program supports the   work of Professor Dale Shellhamer at Point Loma
              Nazarene   College who will involve undergraduate students in the study   of
              interhalogens XF (X= I,Br,Cl)  synthesized from a   combination of various
              electrophilic reagents. The resulting   interhalogens will be added to a
              variety of unsaturated   hydrocarbons with the goal of elucidating the
              versatility   and utility for XF in synthesis. Evidence for the elusive  
              cationic form of Xe-O will be sought. The synthesis of    reagents containing
              N-F bonds as mild fluorination reagents   will be studied.  This research will
              enhance the    understanding of species that are selective in fluorination  
              reactions.    %%%  In this project Professor Dale Shellhamer will explore the  
              unique behavior of fluorine containing compounds so that the   very high
              reactivity of fluorine can be moderated. The   results from these studies will
              develop utilitarian uses of   specially designed fluorine reagents so that
              fluorine can be   introduced into organic compounds under controlled  
              conditions.  ***
