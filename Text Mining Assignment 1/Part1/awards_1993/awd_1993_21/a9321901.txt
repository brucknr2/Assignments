Abstract    :
              9321901  Dunlap         This is a study of global perceptions of environmental 
              problems.  Results from a 1992 international survey of  representative samples
              of adults in 24 economically and  geographically diverse nations will be
              analyzed in detail.    Three broad types of investigation will be conducted: 1)
              Various  analyses of individual-level survey data will be conducted to  test
              models of the nature and sources of environmental concern  within nations, as
              well as across nations;  2) Results from the  foregoing analyses will be used
              to create aggregate-level  measures of public perceptions for each nation, and
              these will be  combined with existing data on the economic, social, political 
              and environmental characteristics of these same nations to allow 
              aggregate-level model testing at the national and regional  levels;  3)
              Potential links between national-level  characteristics and individual-level
              perceptions will be  investigated using a variety of contextual analysis
              techniques.   In all of these analyses, special attention will be paid to how 
              perceptions of global change are interrelated with perceptions of  a wide range
              of environmental phenomena.  %%%       In addition to providing unprecedented
              information on public  perceptions related to global environmental change that
              will be  of value to research and policy-making communities, this study  offers
              an opportunity to test general theories and extend  existing social science
              research on the nature and sources of  environmental awareness and concern.
