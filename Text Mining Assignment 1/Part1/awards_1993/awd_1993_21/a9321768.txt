Abstract    :
              9321768  Koel  Studies of the structure and reactivity of thin Pd overlayers  on
              refractory metal substrates forms the focus of the research  supported in this
              project.  By combining ion scattering,  scanning tunneling microscopy, and
              kinetic studies using  thermal desorption spectroscopy, the differences between
               surface and bulk reactivity of Pd will be probed.  The results  of this
              investigation, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, will
              impact on our understanding of  bimetallic catalytic systems.  Chemisorption
              and reaction  properties will be correlated with geometric and electronic 
              effects measured spectroscopically.  %%%  The interaction between a
              catalytically active transition metal  and an unreactive substrate underlies
              widely used bimetallic  catalyst systems.  This research project probes the
              geometric  and electronic effects in bimetallic systems which control the 
              catalytic chemistry.  Information from studies of this sort  provide the
              knowledge base for the design and manipulation of  heterogeneous catalytic
              materials.  ***
