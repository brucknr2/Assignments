Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Michael Pietrusewsky/M. Douglas  SBR-9321152    Extensive
              archaeological research among peoples living around the Mediterranean and in
              prehistoric America has been conducted in an attempt to document the transition
              to agriculture and its subsequent effects on human health.  One very common new
              hypothesis is that the transition to dependence on one or a few agricultural
              crops   from gathering a large number of wild fruits and vegetables had a
              number of detrimental effects on the health of early agricultural populations. 
              However, very little attention has been given to these same issues in human
              populations found living in the unique tropical monsoon enviornment of
              Southeast Asia, where the domestication and early intensification of rice
              agriculture is believed to have occurred.  It may well be, for example, that
              dependence on rice, rather than maize, may not have been so detrimental to the
              health of the population.     Through a study of human skeletal remains from
              northern Thailand, this dissertation research project will address the health
              status of the ancient inhabitants of this critical comparative area of early
              agriculture, from the beginnings of rice cultivation through its
              intensification and population dependence.  ***  P\anthro\jfried\9321152.abs
