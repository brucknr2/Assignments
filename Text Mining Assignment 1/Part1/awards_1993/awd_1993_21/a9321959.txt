Abstract    :
              The PI has recently demonstrated that stretch and preferential diffusion can
              have a significant effect on laminar burning velocities and consequently on
              turbulent flame speeds in practical applications.  This proposal is an
              extension of this work and will include some measurements of laminar burning
              velocities under low-gravity conditions in order to minimize the effects of
              buoyancy.  The PI proposes to use an outwardly-propagating spherical laminar
              flame technique and a short drop tower (test time ~ 500 ms) to carry out these
              measurements.  Specific objectives will include:  (1) New measurements of
              unstretched laminar burning velocities and preferential-diffusion/stretch
              interactions (or Markstein numbers), using various fuels, oxidant/diluent
              mixtures and pressures.  (2) Numerical simulation of both unstretched and
              stretched premixed flames including detailed models of chemical kinetics and
              multicomponent diffusion.  (3) Use of these results to evaluate theoretical
              predictions, and to help diagnose the mechanism of
              preferential-diffusion/stretch interactions and estimate flame behavior under
              negative stretch conditions.
