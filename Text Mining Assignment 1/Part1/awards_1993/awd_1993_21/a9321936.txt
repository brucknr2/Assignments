Abstract    :
              9321936  McCarthy       This project refines the design tools and trains
              industry and   academia to use them, and to expand this design technology to  
              include spatial 4C mechanisms.  These latter mechanisms retain the   simplicity
              of four links and hinges, with the bearings that slide   as well as rotate, and
              have a complexity of movement similar to   general robot manipulators.  With
              these design tools engineers will   be able to invent completely new, simple,
              reliable, and cost-   effective systems to guide a prescribed spatial movement.
               This   capability will result in new commercial products and components   for
              manufacturing automation.       Spatial mechanisms provide simple elegant
              solutions to the   need for prescribed spatial movement.  Unfortunately, the
              three   dimensionality of their construction and movement is difficult for   a
              designer to visualize, and they are rarely employed in industry.   Previous
              research has used visualization tools to design and build   the simplest
              spatial mechanism, the spherical 4R linkage.  Open-   ended projects have
              resulted in a wide-range of ideas for new   products and new components for
              automation systems all based on   spherical mechanisms.
