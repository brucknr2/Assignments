Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9321441  Antonucci    This research will involve studies of the
              nature of active galactic nuclei, quasars, and primeval galaxies. A new
              technique of spectropolarimetry  will be used to obtain multidirectional views
              of active nuclei, and to capitalize on the results with certain observations at
              other wavelengths.  There will be studies of radio-quiet quasars.  Optical
              broadband and near-IR narrow-and broadband imaging will be used to test whether
              certain specially-selected very faint radio sources, unidentified on deep
              optical CCD images, could be at ultra-high redshifts (6{SYMBOL 163 \f "Symbol"}
              Z {SYMBOL 163 \f "Symbol"} 20).  ***
