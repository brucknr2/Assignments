Abstract    :
              9321407  Wahlen  This award is for support to investigate, in detail, the timing
              between changes in temperature (indicated by the isotopes of oxygen and
              hydrogen in the ice, as well as the accumulation rate) and atmospheric carbon
              dioxide (from measurements of occluded air) in the high resolution Greenland
              Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core from central Greenland.  The carbon
              dioxide measurements will be performed over periods of rapid climate change,
              such as the last glacial to interglacial transition and during the glacial
              interstadials, the Eemian and the previous glacial.  The determination of leads
              or lags between temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide will help to
              understand the interplay of carbon dioxide and climate.  The carbon isotope
              composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide will also be analyzed for these
              periods in order to gain more information about the mechanisms and processes
              responsible for carbon dioxide and climate variations.  ***
