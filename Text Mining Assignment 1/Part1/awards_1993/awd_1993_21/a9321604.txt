Abstract    :
              9321604  Stephan/Glenn   The whooping crane is a well known endangered species
              that is successfully recovering from a severe reduction in population size (a
              population size bottleneck).  Whooping cranes were reduced to one wild
              population with 14 adults in 1941, but now number more than 300 individuals.
              Additionally there are large numbers of whooping cranes in museum collections
              from previous historical populations.  Because it is now possible to obtain
              genetic information from museum specimens, whooping cranes represent an
              opportunity to measure directly the loss of genetic variation in an uniquely
              well studied species that has experienced a population bottleneck.   Stephan
              and Glenn propose to sequence and analyze mitochondrial and nuclear DNA loci of
              the whooping cranes.  By obtaining genetic information from individuals that
              lived prior to, during, and following the most severe portion of the
              bottleneck, they will be able to compare the level of the genetic variation in
              whooping cranes with that predicted by population genetic models.  Based on
              these comparisons, they will have the opportunity to assess the accuracy of
              theoretical models and to suggest the reintroduction strategy that most closely
              mimics the historical pattern of genetic variation among the populations of
              whooping cranes.
