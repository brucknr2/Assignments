Abstract    :
              9321057  Simchon   This SBIR Phase II project addresses a modified, augmented 
              hydrostatic extrusion process for production of very fine wire.   Such wire is
              used as bonding wire in microchips.  With the advent of modern
              micro-electronics, the need for gold and  aluminum wire of fine diameter has
              continuously increased.  In the  fabrication of very fine wire, severe limits
              exist on the speed,  reduction per mass, and thinness of the emerging wire.  In
              the Phase I study of the processes of wire drawing and augmented  hydrostatic
              extrusion (hydraw) of very fine wire, root causes and  the nature of these
              limitations were studied, both analytically and  experimentally.  A modified
              process for Phase II was designed  according to criteria developed in this
              study.  Wire of 0.5 mil (0.0125 mm) was produced, and experimental quantities
              of wire were  made on laboratory equipment and tested.     The Phase II goal is
              a production prototype hydraw unit for 0.5 mil  gold and aluminum wire.  The
              prototype machine will be used to  study the reliability and quality of the
              wire product and economic  parameters of the modified hydraw concept.
