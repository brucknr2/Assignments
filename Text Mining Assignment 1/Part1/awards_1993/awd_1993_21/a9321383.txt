Abstract    :
              9321383  Glassey        This award supports research on systems of nonlinear 
              partial differential equations and applications to plasma theory.  The work
              involves both analytical and numerical points of view.   The emphasis is on
              collisional effects in problems arising in  plasma physics.  This involves the
              modification of the Vlasov-  Maxwell systems through the addition of collision
              operators of  Boltzmann- and Landau-type.  The major thrust of this effort is 
              dedicated to the study of Landau damping, in which the long time  behavior the
              initial value problem for the linearized Vlasov  equation is prescribed.  Work
              has already been done on finding  optimal decay rates in the relativistic case,
              in which the range  of validity is restricted by the fact that collisional
              effects  are neglected.  Emphasis will now be placed on understanding  decay in
              the nonrelativistic setting.  Studies will also be made  on the Vlasov-Einstein
              system to include a fully relativistic  model for stellar dynamic problems. 
              The work is important  because of its relation to cosmic censorship.        
              Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the
              physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create
              the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information
              about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these
              approximations.   ***
