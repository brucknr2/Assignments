Abstract    :
              The aim of this research is the development of molecular thermodynamic models to
              predict protein adsorption in ion exchange chromatography.  Models will
              incorporate electrostatic and van der Waals components for protein-surface and
              protein-interactions with particular interests related to adsorption patterns
              and molecular orientations.  Brownian dynamics simulations are to be performed
              in order to examine kinetic effects.  A complementary experimental component
              comrises characterization of protein adsorption on quartz or silica by total
              internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) spectroscopy, surface force
              measurements, atomic force microscopy and other methods.    This project should
              help improve one of the major methods for purification of some pharmaceuticals
              and products of genetic engineering technologies.
