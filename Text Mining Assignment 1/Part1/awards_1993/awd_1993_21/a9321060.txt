Abstract    :
              9321060  Merit, Inc.  Aupperle    The major project elements for the routing
              arbiter include  advancement of Internet routing algorithms with respect to
              scaling  and stability issues, routing information registration and 
              dissemination for the network service providers serving the  Internet,
              deployment of route servers to aid in the dissemination  and real time
              maintenance of the global Internet routing system,  and coordination and
              sharing of technical information in support of  the Internet operations
              community.  A key task for the routing  arbiter will be to enhance the use of
              new switched services offered  by the telecommunications carriers, sucy as ATM,
              in place of  dedicated point to point technology that is widely deployed in
              wide  area internets.    This proposal is a part of a collaborative effort with
              USC.  Merit  will take the lead responsibility for the Management and 
              Coordination, Transition, Routing Registry Dababase, Routing  Operations Center
              (ROC) and GateD software development and  collaboration.  It will provide
              consultation to USC in routing  engineering who will take the lead in research
              and development.    Both the Merit and USC teams will collaborate in all areas,
              but  Merit will take the lead for operations, for communications with  clients
              relative to the services provided and for overall  coordination.
