Abstract    :
              9321289  Danchi    The Infrared Spatial Interferometer developed at the
              University of  California at Berkeley is at present the world's only multi- 
              aperture stellar interferometer operating in the 9-12 um  atmospheric window. 
              This instrument, involving two movable 1.65 m  aperture Pfund telescopes,
              offers unprecedented resolution in the  10 um wavelength region with an ~30
              milli-arcsec (mas) resolution  at the longest currently available baseline. 
              Support is provided  for upgrades to the hardware of the ISI in four areas that
              would  significantly add to its capabilities.  The first area is to extend  the
              quantum efficiency and bandwidth with a new type of heterodyne  detector.  The
              second area is to upgrade the autoguiding system to  use the near-infrared
              radiation from the stars rather than visible  light.  This would allow
              sufficiently short integration times for  tip-tilt stabilization of the image
              for the stars in the present  observing program.  In addition, this would allow
              guiding on stars  which radiate very weakly at visible wavelengths and yet are 
              intense enough at 11 um to be observed with the ISI, such as some 
              proto-planetary nebulae, OH/IR stars, and proto-stellar sources.   The third
              area involves upgrading the delay line and correlator to  match the bandwidth
              of the present detectors.  The effective  bandwidth of the correlator and delay
              line is about 1600 MHz, while  the present detectors have bandwidths exceeding
              3000 MHz.  Thus a  significant gain in sensitivity can be achieved through an 
              improvement to this part of the system.  The fourth area is to  develop the
              site at Mt. Wilson to increase the baseline length in  at least two directions
              to the maximum allowed by the site, which  is about 100 m, increasing the
              maximum resolution to about 10 mas.  ***
