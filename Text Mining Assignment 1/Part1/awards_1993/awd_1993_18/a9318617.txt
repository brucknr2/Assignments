Abstract    :
              9318617  Sellwood    Current understanding of the structure, origin and
              evolution of galaxies has advanced enormously in the last decade, due in part
              to advances in astronomical detector technology, and in part to advances in
              computer power and theoretical insight.  The grant will address a number of
              closely related fundamental questions in galactic dynamics, including: the
              origin and evolution of disk and spheroidal galaxies, with particular focus on
              the role of dynamical instabilities; the structure of triaxial elliptical
              galaxies, especially those with large centric densities; and the dark matter
              content of a wide class of stellar systems, including elliptical and barred
              galaxies.  Included in the research are:  analysis of large-scale N-body
              simulations; analytical and semi-analytical studies; and analysis of
              observational data.  ***
