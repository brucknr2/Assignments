Abstract    :
              9318908  Ramirez    The physiological importance of progesterone and its
              metabolites  and their effect on the nervous system has been recognized for a 
              long time.  However, the mechanism of action at the molecular level  is not
              clear.  Dr. Ramirez will test the hypothesis that  progesterone binds with the
              membrane of nervous tissue and this  leads to the control of release of another
              hormone known as  luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone.  This work is
              important  because it may lead to a better understanding of the effect of 
              steroid action upon mood and behavior by paving the way for  development of new
              pharmacological agents.  ***
