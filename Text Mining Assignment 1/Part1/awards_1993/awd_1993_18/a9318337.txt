Abstract    :
              9318377  Cogger       This award provides for further development of the
              CU-SeeMe  and reflector software.  CU-SeeMe software provides multiparty 
              desktop videoconferencing using Apple Macintosh computers connected  to the
              Internet.  The system uses other computers running reflector  software to knit
              together multiparty conferences.  Improvements to  be added include porting to
              PC platforms, adding color capability,  integrating audio, improving ease of
              use, and upgrading several  performance parameters.  The award provides partial
              funding for 36  months.  ***
