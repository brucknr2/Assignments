Abstract    :
              9318794  Jacobsen  Dr. Eric N. Jacobsen is being funded by the Organic Synthesis
              Program as a Presidential Young  Investigator.  He will be studying the
              development of enantioselective catalysts for organic  synthesis.  The
              oxidation of unfunctionalized olefins will be the first reaction that he will 
              explore.  %%%  Facial selectivity in group transfer to a prochiral olefin can
              be controlled by purely non-bonded  interactions or by constraining the degrees
              of freedom in diastereometric transition states through  substrate
              pre-coordination.  Catalytic systems are being developed based on both
              principles.  A  series of chiral manganese complexes have been designed which
              catalyze epoxidation of isolated  and unfunctionalized olefins by iodosoarenes
              with up to 33% enantiomeric excess.  The ligands  for these complexes are
              readily prepared by condensation of chiral diamines with salicylaldehyde 
              derivatives, permitting systematic variation of their steric and electronic
              properties.  Current  efforts are directed toward tuning the steric environment
              surrounding the reactive site in order  to increase enantioselectivity to
              synthetically useful levels and to use observed stereochemical  preferences to
              map out the trajectory of olefin approach to the intermediate metal oxo
              species.   The results with six catalysts prepared to date and examination of a
              crystal structure of the most  effective system have allowed a detailed
              transition structure for oxygen-atom-transfer from  manganese to olefin to be
              developed.  This model is now being refined by systematic variation  of metal,
              ligand, and substrate; the elucidation of a transition structure which holds
              predictive  value with regard to stereochemistry will also provide mechanistic
              insight into the general  question of oxygen-atom transfer from metals to
              olefins, an important step in a wide range of  laboratory, industrial, and
              biological processes.
