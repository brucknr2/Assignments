Abstract    :
              9318905   Lupton       Assoc. of Computer and Information Science Depts. in 
              Minority Institutions (ADMI) Training and Planning Workshop for  Small Colleges
              Use of the Internet and NSFNET The Associations of  Computer and Information
              Science and Engineering Departments at  Minority Institutions (ADMI) was formed
              to assist minority  institutions in the development and strengthening of their 
              research and education programs.  As part of its Annual Workshop  ADMI, a
              training and planning tutorial on networking is proposed  for small
              institutions located predominantly in the northwest  area of the nation.      
              The tutorial will provide an overview of networking and its  use and help to
              develop plans for Native American colleges,  reservation institutions of higher
              education, and others to  become effective network users.  Communication links
              between  small colleges and larger institutions are of vital importance  which
              allow educators to cross over barriers that exist between  two year colleges,
              four year colleges, and research universities.  ***
