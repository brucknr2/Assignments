Abstract    :
              9318537  Singh  This theoretical and computationally-intensive research will use
               series expansion methods to investigate a variety of problems of  current
              interest in condensed matter physics.  The principal  investigator has
              developed the basic methodology to generate series  expansions for quantum
              magnets, for models of strongly correlated  Fermi systems, and for disordered
              systems such as spin glasses.   For these systems, series expansions have been
              obtained for uniform  thermodynamic quantities, for static response functions,
              for wave-  vector dependent equal-time spin and charge correlation functions 
              and for frequency moments of dynamical correlation functions.  A  major focus
              will be to understand the normal state properties of  high temperature
              superconducting cuprates.  Results will be  compared to experiments on these
              materials such as nuclear magnetic  resonance, neutron and light scattering,
              photoemission, and  transport phenomena.  The Kondo lattice and Hubbard models
              on non-  bipartite lattices will be studied to gain insight into the 
              electron-correlation driven metal-insulator transition.  Other  systems to be
              studied include critical phenomena in random quantum  systems, ordering in
              frustrated spin models and conformal  invariance in two-dimensional
              non-integrable statistical models.  %%%  This renewal grant will use series
              expansion techniques, which were  originally developed for the study of phase
              transitions, and apply  them to problems involving strongly correlated
              materials.  The  approach taken by the principal investigator is somewhat
              unique and  complements other computational techniques used to study these 
              problems.  The problems to be studied include the high temperature 
              superconductors, magnetic materials and the metal-insulator  transition.  ***
