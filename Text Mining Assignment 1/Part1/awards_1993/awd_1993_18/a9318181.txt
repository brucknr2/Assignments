Abstract    :
              9318181  Gombosi       This highly interdisciplinary effort is to develop tools
              for  modeling nonequilibrium fluids and plasmas using adaptively refined  grids
              on parallel supercomputers.  The development of parallel  adaptive-grid
              methodology, including effective strategies for load  balancing and efficient
              utilization of high-performance  microprocessors, will have a major impact on
              the solution of  problems in all areas of fluid and plasma physics.  Specific 
              examples include geospace environment modeling, high-altitude  aerodynamics,
              atmospheric science, nonlinear systems generally and  advanced propulsion
              systems.  The first application of this model  development will be the
              development of a global magnetospheric  model which will be made available to
              the magnetospheric physics  community.  This model will use high-order moments
              of the Boltzman  equation with solutions on a 3D adaptively-refined,
              unstructured  mesh which will allow multiple scale analyses, including
              sub-grid-  size kinetic effects.  ***
