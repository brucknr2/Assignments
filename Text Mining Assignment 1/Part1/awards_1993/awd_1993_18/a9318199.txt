Abstract    :
              9318199  Phillips  Description:  This project is a calorimetric  determination
              of the complete magnetic phase  diagram for the ordered phases of EuNi3P3.  The
               existence of a very complex and unusual phase  diagram for this material was
              made clear by  measurements of the magnetization that showed a  series of steps
              at 4.3 and 5.5K, but which left  much of the interesting region of the phase 
              diagram undetermined.  The proposed research  will define the phase diagram
              associated with  these steps from the lowest temperatures of  interest to TN
              =7.5K, and through the entire  range of magnetic fields of interest.  The 
              results will permit a detailed comparison with  magnetic structures, which are
              being determined  by neutron diffraction, and with the theory of  the steps;
              and thus contribute to a fundamental  understanding of the relations among
              magnetic  interactions, magnetic structures, and the  properties of magnetic
              materials.    Scope:  Dr. P. Radhakrishna of Jawaharlal Nehru  Centre for
              Advanced Scientific Studies,  Bangalore, India, will play a key role in the 
              project by bringing his expertise in neutron  diffraction and magnetic
              structures to bear on  the design and interpretation of the  experiments.
