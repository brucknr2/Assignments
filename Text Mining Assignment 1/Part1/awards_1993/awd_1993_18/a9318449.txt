Abstract    :
              9318449  Reading       Further development of the independent particle model and
               correlation effects in atom-ion collisions are proposed.  A many  body
              perturbation approach through second order will be used to  study a number of
              collision problems of theoretical and  experimental interest.  The forced
              impulse method will be  extended to lower energies and to other two electron
              processes in  He and H2.  Excitation, ionization and double ionization effects 
              will be examined during the term of the grant.  ***
