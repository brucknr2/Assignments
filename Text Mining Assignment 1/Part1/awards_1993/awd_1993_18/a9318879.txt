Abstract    :
              9318879   Heker  Consistent with the mission of the JVNCnet which is to support 
              the academic and research networking communities in the Northeast  and in order
              to facilitate the provision of networking services  to these institutions,
              Global Enterprise Services is requesting  partial support for the addition of 8
              predominantly undergraduate  institutions to the NSFNET family of networks
              through the JVNCnet  midlevel network.    Each institution has separately
              included information regarding  their facility and their need to be a member of
              the NSFNET.  The  list of schools includes: Burlington County College -
              NJ(2yr),  Mercer County College - NJ(2yr), Felician College - NJ, Gordon- 
              Conwell Seminary - MA, Gordon College - MA, Mercy College - NY,  Wesley College
              - DE, Cedar Crest College - PA.    These eight institutions participating in
              this proposal represent  the diversity of the educational system in the United
              States.   Schools range from two-year to four-year institutions, from 
              primarily teaching facilities to research environments, and from  small to
              large student bodies.  All share the desire to gain  access to the resources
              and people made reachable through the  NSFNET, with the goal of improving the
              quality of their  educational offerings and outreach to their communities.   
              Global Enterprise Services will act as a regional or mid-level  agent (JVNCnet)
              to identify the networking needs and assist the  academic institutions in the
              northeastern United States to meet  those needs by providing connectivity,
              education and training.   In addition, the JVNCnet is working towards achieving
              financial  self-sufficiency by increasing its membership.
