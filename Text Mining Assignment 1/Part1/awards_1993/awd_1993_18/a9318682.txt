Abstract    :
                9318682    Zoback           This award provides financial support for project
              planning and  coordination efforts associated with a proposed long-term (e.g.
              10  year) project to drill and core deeply into the San Andreas fault  zone and
              to conduct a broad range of scientific investigations in  and around the drill
              hole.  The planning and coordination efforts  are being conducted in close
              collaboration with the USGS and the  DOE (Lawrence Livermore National
              Laboratory).    ***
