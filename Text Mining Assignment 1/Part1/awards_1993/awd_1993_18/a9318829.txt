Abstract    :
              9318829  Wilson  An experiment involving capture of low-energy polarized
              neutrons  in hydrogen will be carried out, and the circular polarization of 
              the resulting gamma ray measured.  This will provide information  on details of
              the nucleon-nucleon interaction, specifically  relativistic effects in the
              meson exchange current mechanism  which dominate the nuclear capture process. 
              This is a  collaboration between US and Russian scientists and will be  carried
              out at a research reactor in Russia  ***
