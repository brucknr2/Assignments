Abstract    :
              9318232  McLaughlin       Among the estimated 16,000 species of basidiomycete
              fungi, the  familiar mushrooms and puffballs and bracket fungi of the world, 
              are forms without conspicuous fruiting bodies but possessing  microscopic
              spore-bearing structures.  The taxonomic relationships  of these numerous
              fungal forms are little studied, although many  economically important crop
              pathogens and ecologically significant  saprobic groups are included here.  As
              well, the phylogenetic or  genealogical affinities of these fungi, among
              themselves and with  the ascomycete fungi, are poorly known.  New molecular
              methods of  DNA sequencing promise large quantities of comparative data for 
              integration with current morphological and ultrastructural findings  for
              eventual taxonomic and phylogenetic synthesis.  Dr. David  McLaughlin at the
              University of Minnesota and postdoctoral  associate Dr. Eric Swann have started
              a major project to acquire  DNA sequence data for numerous representatives of
              the simple  septate groups of Heterobasidiomycetes, and to integrate these new 
              molecular data with traditional taxonomic characters.       Molecular
              phylogenetic analyses of the fungi hold great  promise for improving taxonomic
              recognition of the major lines of  evolution and for resolving longstanding
              controversies about the  origin and morphological diversification of saprobic
              and pathogenic  groups of basidiomycetes.
