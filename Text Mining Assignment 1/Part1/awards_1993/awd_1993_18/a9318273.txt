Abstract    :
              9318273  Prum       Studies of vertebrate breeding systems and social behavior 
              have focused largely on near-term or proximate mechanisms that can  be labelled
              ecological or environmental.  Neglected have been  determinants of behavior
              that are genetic in nature and entrained  phylogenetically, that is present in
              recent common ancestors of the  group of species under study.  Dr. Richard Prum
              of the University  of Kansas will use phylogenetic methods to investigate the 
              historical pathways of evolutionary change in aspects of breeding  and social
              behavior in a diverse lineage of neotropical perching  birds, the cotingas. 
              New characters of syringeal and skeletal  morphology and traditional plumage
              features will be used to  construct a robust hypothesis of phylogenetic
              relationships among  the ca. 90 species of neotropical cotingids; collaborative
              field  work in Brasil will provide new specimens for much of this  research. 
              This hypothesis of phylogeny will be used to analyze  patterns of interspecies
              variation in social behavior and mating  systems and to test comparatively
              several hypotheses about sexual  color differences, sexual size differences,
              and display behavior  homologies.        The project contributes to avian
              systematics and to the  synthesis of phylogenetic, ethological, and behavioral
              research on  birds.
