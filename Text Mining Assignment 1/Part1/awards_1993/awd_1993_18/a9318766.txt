Abstract    :
              9318766  Clauer  This project is a joint U.S.-Russian effort to investigate the 
              structure of electric polar cap currents produced through the  interaction of
              the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field.  The  integrated effect of these
              currents can be observed at the surface  with relatively simple and robust
              magnetometers.    The Russian Antarctic Program operates two unattended remote 
              magnetometers along the traverse route between Mirny and Vostok, as  well as
              attended instruments at the two stations.  The data  acquisition mode of these
              instruments will be converted from analog  to digital, and the existing Russian
              data base, going back to 1978  for some instruments, will be digitized.  The
              digitized data will  be analyzed in conjunction with supporting satellite data
              and  conjugate observations from the northern hemisphere to interpret  the
              three-dimensional convection patterns produced by various  orientations of the
              Earth's magnetic field.  ***
