Abstract    :
              9318865   Mast  Eastern Mennonite College requests support from NSF for 
              connection of its campus network to VERnet.  VERnet is the  midlevel network
              located in the state of Virginia. VERnet will  provide operations management
              and information services and it  will give Eastern Mennonite College connection
              to the NSFNET, a  high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National
              Backbone  network.    The college needs greater functionality and network speed
              to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along
              with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
