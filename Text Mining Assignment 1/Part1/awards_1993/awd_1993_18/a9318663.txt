Abstract    :
                     9318663  Nash   This project involves an award of funds to the PhD
              program in  cultural anthropology at UCLA for the purpose of supporting 
              students' fieldwork before their dissertation research begins.  Students will
              be mentored by faculty as they do preliminary field  research to prepare for
              their dissertation research.   This project is important because it improves
              the scientific  abilities of students, and thus the scientific strength of the 
              US, through providing experience and practice in research  situations.  ***
