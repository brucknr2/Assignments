Abstract    :
              9318323  Wheat  This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Harovel Wheat in a
               research collaboration with Professor Guillermo Hernandez Duque of  the
              Programa De Corrosion del Golfo de Mexico in Campeche, Mexico.   The
              investigators intend to study several repair and protection  techniques that
              could be useful in minimizing corrosion damage to  reinforced concrete
              structures in marine environments.    In this effort, techniques used at the
              University of Texas will be  applied to reinforced concrete samples made with
              Mexican materials.   Complementary techniques such as polarization resistance
              and  electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as well as optical and  scanning
              electron microscopy will also be used to characterize  samples both in Texas
              and in Mexico.  Periodic meetings will  promote the exchange of information and
              results.  ***
