Abstract    :
              9318233  Sweeney  This Proposal requests instrumentation to permit the  assembly
              of a prototype of a new spectrometer, employing  vibrational circular dichroism
              (VCD); the optics will  incorporate a step-scanning interferometer, based on a 
              Fourier transform methodology.  The spectrometer will be the  first of its kind
              and will be capable of increasing the  sensitivity of VCD measurements by 2 to
              3 orders of  magnitude.  A unique feature of such an instrument will be  its
              ability to detect solution structures with lifetimes in  the nanosecond range
              -- structures normally invisible in NMR  analysis.  This will make it
              applicable to a broad range of  structure problems involving biological
              macromolecules.  One  of the major users, Dr. Max Diem, has extensive
              experience  in VCD, having designed and built his own instrument with  the help
              of NSF grant funds several years ago.  This  instrument is currently being used
              for polypeptide and  polynucleotide structural studies in the Chemistry 
              Department, but its sensitivity limits its use to molecules  in the range of
              one kilo-Dalton.  Various projects are  described, from laboratories at Hunter
              and at New York  University, which include investigations of basic aspects of 
              protein and nucleic acid structures in solution, structures  of
              metalloproteins, and facets of the initiation complex in  protein synthesis, as
              well as drug-DNA interactions, and the  design of metal-complexed
              chemotherapeutic agents.    It is anticipated that the new instrument will
              attract  additional users from the Sloan-Kettering Institute for  Cancer
              Research, the Rockefeller University and other  institutions in New York City.
