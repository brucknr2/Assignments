Abstract    :
              9318090  Ward  The Arizona Research Laboratories Biotechnology Computing 
              Facility at the University of Arizona will purchase a Digital  Equipment
              Corporation Dec3000/500 (ALPHA) computer and associated  peripherals.  The
              computer will be dedicated to biotechnology  research projects, primarily DNA
              and protein sequence analysis at  the University of Arizona.  In order to
              provide maximum  connectivity to, and use of, the machine, we will also
              purchase  two Digital Equipment Corporation 90TL terminal servers, and  eight
              high speed U. S. robotics modems.    The Biotechnology Computing Facility is an
              multidisciplinary  facility that supports more than 300 biotechnology computer
              users  representing over 30 departments from 4 colleges.  The specific 
              research that would benefit from the increased computer speed  are: 1) analysis
              of genes involved in cellular morphogenesis and  differentiation in the
              nematode Caenorhabditis elgans; 2) the  identification and analysis of proteins
              of the actin  cytoskeleton; 3) identification and analysis of insect proteins 
              involved in metabolite transport and uptake and endocrinology; 4)  insect
              protein, lipid, and structure/function studies; 5) the  genetic study of the
              olfactory system of Xenopus laevis; and 6)  software development of fast
              sequencing algorithms.    The computer that currently supports most of the DNA
              and Protein  sequencing at the University of Arizona is a Vax 3100/76.  The 
              Dec3000/500 has much faster computing speeds than the present  3100VAX system. 
              The increase in computational speed from the  3100/76 6.6 SPECmarks to VAX
              3100/76 118 SPECmarks will increase  the efficiency and open more computing
              options, both for the  research projects described and for students in
              laboratories and  classes.  Some of these options are not practical at the
              speeds  of our present computer.  ***
