Abstract    :
              9318416  Cruz       The principal investigators will use their expertise in the 
              areas of communications networks, optical devices, fiber optics,  and systems
              engineering in a cohesive research effort aimed at  demonstrating the
              feasibility of time-based optical multiplexors.   Time-based multiplexing is a
              fundamental operation that must be  performed in large-scale wide- area
              networks.  The research will  examine architecture alternatives and demonstrate
              feasibility by  building and testing scalable prototype multiplexors.  A major 
              difficulty in the design of multiplexors is dealing with  contention.  The
              conceptual prototype of a time-based optical  multiplexor, in this study, is
              based on the detection of optical  packets at the packet rate, as opposed to
              the detection of the  optical data at the much higher data rate.   For example,
              the  optical packets can be detected by splitting off a small part of  the
              optical signal using an optical-fiber directional coupler, with  these signals
              detected by a high-sensitivity detector.  For a  two-to-one multiplexor, the
              packet detection will be used to  configure a 2 x 2 guided-wave directional
              coupler switch.  If only  one input has a packet, the packet is routed to the
              output.  If  both inputs have packets, then one packet is routed to the output 
              while the other packet is sent through an optical fiber delay line,  and
              subsequently fed back into another switch.  Several packet  detectors and
              switches can be used to implement various scheduling  algorithms, and to offer
              a higher degree of system reliability.   The multiplexors will be developed
              using commercially available  fiber optic and optoelectronic components.  We
              will iteraltively  examine architecture alternatives and refine our prototypes.
               This will maximize the interaction between the device and network 
              researchers.  ***
