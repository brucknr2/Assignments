Abstract    :
              9318481  Amasino    The major developmental change in the plant life cycle is
              the initiation of flowering.  Genetic and physiological analyses have revealed
              that many plant species have evolved the ability to regulate flowering in
              response to environmental cues such as changes in temperature or daylength. 
              However, the biochemical mechanisms by which plants sense and respond to
              environmental cues to initiate flowering are unknown.  To lay a foundation for
              studying this process at the molecular level, Dr. Amasino has isolated a gene
              from Arabidopsis thaliana, luminidependens (LD), that is involved in floral
              induction.  Mutations in the LD gene render Arabidopsis late flowering; thus,
              the wild-type function of LD is likely to promote flowering.  Physiological
              analyses indicate that LD is specifically involved in photoperiodism.  Dr.
              Amasino proposes to characterize the tissue specificity, developmental timing,
              and environmental regulation of LD at the mRNA and protein levels, and
              determine the sequence of LD genes from other species, and perform
              site-directed mutagenesis on the protein.  To determine the role of LD in other
              species, he will block expression in other species through antisense RNA and/or
              co-suppression techniques.  Dr. Amasino will explore the effects of different
              light qualities and quantities on the phenotype of mutant and wild-type plants
              to address the photoreceptor systems influenced by the LD mutation.  He will
              determine the interactions of the LD mutation with other flowering mutations to
              define the position of LD in flowering pathways.  Lastly, Dr. Amasino will
              initiate the long-term goals of ident ifying suppressors of the LD mutation and
              isolating genes regulated by LD.  ***   SOL     EXE           @ j
