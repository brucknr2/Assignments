Abstract    :
              9318977  Tarboton    Rainfall, runoff, erosion, mass movement, and sediment
              transport  are the physical processes that sculpture and form the landscape.  
              Geomorphological landforms are the signature of the action of  hydrologic
              processes on the landscape.  Fluvial landscapes have a  structural regularity
              that has been quantified by Horton's and  numerous other scaling laws.  The
              ubiquity and explanatory strength  of these empirical relationships, even in
              diverse geologic and  climatic settings, suggests a deep universality and
              regularity in  fluvial landorms that goes beyond the details of the particular 
              processes involved.  The objective is a quantitative understanding  of the
              relationship between processes and form in landscapes at  scales ranging from
              single hillslopes to complete river basins and  investigate the relationship
              between scaling properties and the  general form of geomorphic processes.  This
              relationship will be  investigated using numerical modeling together with
              careful  analysis of field data where geomorphological processes have been 
              quantified.
