Abstract    :
              9318684  Chamberlain       This award provides one-half the funds required to
              purchase   a high-sensitivity, stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer system 
              to be installed and operated in the Department of Earth Sciences at  Dartmouth
              College. The College is committed to providing the  remaining funds necessary
              for the equipment acquisition. The mass  spectrometer system will be capable of
              analyzing very small samples  in the micromole range, a capability that is
              necessary when the  spectrometer is operated in conjunction with a laser
              extraction  line for microsampling of small mineral grains. Research projects 
              of the principal investigator and colleagues that will make use of  the mass
              spectrometer system include investigations of fluid flow  processes in large
              metamorphic complexes, relating the isotopic  composition of microtektites and
              glasses from the Cretaceous-  Tertiary boundary to their possible impact target
              rocks, and using  the isotopic composition of mineral to explain the ore
              forming  processes that form mineral deposits.  ***
