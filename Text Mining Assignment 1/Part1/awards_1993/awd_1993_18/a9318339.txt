Abstract    :
              9318339  Kavvas  The objectives of the project are to develop: a
              physically-based  two dimensional climate model (over zonal and meridional 
              directions)describing the physics of atmosphere-ocean-land  interactions; an
              understanding of the relative importance of  various possible drought-causing
              mechanisms over the United  States and the northern hemisphere.  Also, to use
              the model for  examining the feed-back processes in the evolution of droughts 
              including anthropogenic termination; and for performing Monte  Carlo
              simulations to investigate the characteristics of  initiation, evolution and
              termination of droughts and to develop  the corresponding probability
              distributions.  The results from  this work will advance the quality of
              forcasting the onset,  evolution and duration of droughts and may eventually
              benefit the  well being and economic development of people exposed to 
              droughts.  ***
