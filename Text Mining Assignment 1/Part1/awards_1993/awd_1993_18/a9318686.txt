Abstract    :
              9318686          Matty    Saline ground-water seeps have been recently found
              entering Lake  Ontario.  Although stable isotope and geochemical analyses
              indicate  that the saline ground water is from regional saline formation 
              water, the source for the formation water is not well constrained.  
              Geochemical and isotopic evidence indicates that high Cl values in  the water
              of Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron may be in part caused by the  direct discharge to
              the bay of saline ground water from saline  formation water from the Michigan
              basin.  Since the source and  hydrogeology of the Saginaw Bay area is better
              constrained than in  Lake Ontario, Saginaw Bay is an excellent site to study
              the  interaction of saline-formation water, near-surface ground water,  and
              large lakes.  The objectives of this research are to 1)  document the
              occurrence and source of saline water in the sediments  of Saginaw Bay by
              geochemical and isotopic determinations;  (2)  relate the occurrence of the
              saline water in the bay sediments to  the surrounding ground-water chemistry by
              comparing spatial iso-  chemical trends in the pore waters of the bay with that
              of the  ground water; and (3)  determine the effect of the saline water on 
              pore-water chemistry by chemical modeling.  This will be  accomplished by
              examining geochemical and isotopic characteristics  of pore water in sediments
              of Saginaw Bay and in water of the  streams in the major watershed entering the
              bay.  The data will be  studied in the context of the hydrogeochemistry of the
              regional as  well as local ground-water systems.  Results from this study will 
              be important in understanding the importance of direct ground-water  discharge
              to large lakes and the interaction of large lakes and  regional ground-water
              flow particularly that part of the flow that  involves deep saline formation
              water.  ***
