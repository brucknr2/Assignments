Abstract    :
                9318102  schenck  This is a proposal to purchase equipment for the measurement
              of fluorescence lifetimes and fluorescence anisotropy lifetimes of biological
              macromolecules.  The equipment will be capable of recording fluorescence
              lifetime decays spanning the time range from 20 ps to 100 ns and longer, and
              will allow the use of a wide variety of fluorophores spanning the spectrum to
              UV to near infrared.  The requested equipment is composed of a titanium
              sapphire mode locked laser and associated optical and electronic components.
              Among other topics, the equipment will be used to study the mechanism of
              bacterial photosynthesis (using peptides that have been manipulated by site
              directed mutagenesis), charge separation reactions in bacterial photosynthesis,
              and energy transfer in bacteriorhodopsin.   u    ~       \   ^ _ ` a b c d e
