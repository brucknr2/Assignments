                                        ABSTRACT                                  9318727 
              Timbie         Recent measurements of the spectrum and the spatial  anisotropy
              of the 2.7K Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation  (CMBR) have dramatically
              improved our understanding of the  early universe.  The third characteristic of
              this radiation,  its polarization, has not been measured as precisely.  The 
              amplitude of the linear polarization and its angular  coherence length are
              extremely sensitive to both the source  of anisotropy (density perturbations or
              gravitational waves)  and the ionization history of the universe.  The
              predicted  polarization amplitude is 10% of the size of the COBE/DMR 
              anisotropy signals at 7, or T/T110-6.  This grant will  support o perform the
              first measurements optimized for this  angular scale and smaller.   It will use
              new receiver  technology with 100 times more sensitivity than previous 
              polarization experiments, as well as a novel instrument  design.  It is
              expected to reach a factor of about 100 below  present upper limits at this
              scale.  An improved upper  limit, or detection of polarization will help to:   
                determine whether the large-scale anisotrophies were    generated by density
              perturbations or by gravitational    waves    determine if recombination was
              instantaneous    determine the redshift of reionization    study the
              correlation of anisotropy with polarization    constrain possible alternative
              sources of polarization of    the CMBR such as axions, cosmic strings, and
              textures              The project will measure CMBR polarization, first  at
              large angular scales (7) and later at smaller scales (1).  Two novel
              polarimeters optimized specifically for both  measurements are being
              constructed.  They will operate at  two different millimeter wavelengths to
              reject foreground  emission from synchrotron radiation and feature strictly- 
              controlled systematic effects and the high sensitivity  required to reach the
              expected signal level.        ***
