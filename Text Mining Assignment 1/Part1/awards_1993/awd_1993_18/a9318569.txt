Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9318569  Bering  This award supports the
              continuing analysis of electric field and  x-ray data from a series of
              Antarctic balloon flights.  There have  been a number of long-duration flights
              from South Pole and from the  Japanese's Syowa Station, the most recent during
              the 1992-93  season, which have carried instruments from the University of 
              Houston group.  The analysis will focus on magnetospheric ultra-low  frequency
              wave activity, as measured from the balloons, and  correlations with existing
              Antarctic ground based instruments.  ***
