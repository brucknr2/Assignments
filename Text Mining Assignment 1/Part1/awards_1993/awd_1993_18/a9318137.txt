Abstract    :
              9318137  Pfeffer        The principal investigators will conduct an
              investigation into  the behavior of stationary and transient waves in the
              atmosphere  through a series of laboratory experiments with a rotating annulus.
                This research represents a continuation of work with the annulus  which is
              complemented by diagnostic and theoretical analyses.  In  particular, the PIs
              will explore the effects of the basic state  potential vorticity gradient and
              latent heat release on wave  behavior as well as the fate of
              topographically-induced midlatitude  waves as they encounter the tropics with
              its different flow regime  (reflection or absorption).  In conducting the
              laboratory  experiments, the PIs will test new techniques for creating the 
              potential vorticity gradients and for simulating latent heat  release and wave
              absorption at the so-called critical line.  These  experiments, combined with
              the diagnostic and modeling studies,  should provide insights into still
              unresolved questions about  planetary scale atmospheric wave behavior.  ***
