Abstract    :
              9318471 Bennett      MU SPIN, The Minority University   Space Interdisciplinary
              Network, is a program for minority universities, as well as colleges with
              significant enrollments, which is oriented around wide area networking
              technology and its use for supporting multi disciplinary research.  Sponsorship
              is by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the
              University Programs Office, the Equal opportunity Office, and NASA
              Headquarters.  Based on the success of the 1991 and 1992 meeting, this period
              is to support the third meeting of the MU SPIN Users Working Group, September
              12   14, 1993 at a hotel near the Goddard Space Flight Center.  The meeting is
              to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas on networking to support
              interdisciplinary research.  Funding will support the cost of participant
              travel, meals, and meeting arrangements.  The project is directly related to
              the interest of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering
              Directorate in that CISE is actively supporting programs to enhance the
              opportunities of underrepresented population in the computer field.  Access to
              adequate facilities, and the interchange made available by the network
              connections is an important aspect of this effort, and the program of the
              workshop should enhance the opportunities of the participants. ***
