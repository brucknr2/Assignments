Abstract    :
              9318610  Bramble    The project will investigate the complex interactions 
              between forces that result from locomotor activity and the  mechanics of the
              respiratory system in mammals.  Traditionally, mammalian locomotion and
              respiratory  physiology have been studied as discretely different  phenomena,
              but recently acquired evidence supports the view  that the chest of mammals has
              evolved to integrate these  activities, both structurally and functionally, in
              a manner  that previously has not been understood.  Bramble and  Jenkins
              (Science, 262:235-240) demonstrated that inertial  displacements of the
              abdominal viscera in trotting dogs  passively drive the diaphragm independent
              of diaphragmatic  contractions, which primarily serve to modulate visceral 
              motion.  Visceral displacements and the loading of the  anterior chest walls by
              the forelimbs are among the factors  producing asynchronous ventilation of the
              lungs and the  recycling of air between their lobes.  The present project  is
              designed to further explore these complex interactions,  specifically by
              documenting (in several mammalian species  that exhibit different locomotor
              styles) the  interrelationships of visceral and diaphragmatic kinematics 
              induced by different gaits and speeds, the activity of the  primary respiratory
              muscles, and the ventilation patterns  within the lungs.  The resultant data
              still substantially  contribute to a better understanding of the functional 
              design of the mammalian respiratory system.  ***
