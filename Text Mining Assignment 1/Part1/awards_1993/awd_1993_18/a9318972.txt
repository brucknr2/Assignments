Abstract    :
              9318972  Sharp  La Roche College requests support from NSF for connection of its
               campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network  located in the
              state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide  operations management and
              information services and it will give  La Roche College a connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 -  45 million bits per second) National Backbone
              network.    The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be 
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
