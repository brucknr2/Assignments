Abstract    :
              9318124  Cooper    Biological systems are, in general, very resourceful in 
              responding to external signals.  We have identified such a  response in BC3H-1
              myocytes, a mouse muscle cell line.  These cells are used in research because
              they respond to  insulin to increase glucose uptake.  In this case, the 
              myocytes rapidly switch the types of proteins they  synthesize so that they can
              enhance glucose uptake in  response to insulin.  The protein being investigated
              is  protein kinase C beta.  This enzyme phosphorylates or  regulates other
              enzymes to enhance or inhibit their  function.  It is a component of the
              glucose transport system  in myocytes and its activation is required for the 
              stimulation of glucose uptake.  Protein kinase C beta is  interesting because
              two forms of the enzyme can be expressed  by cells due to alternative splicing
              of its precursor RNA.  Alternative splicing of protein kinase C beta leads to 
              differences in the C-terminal end of the protein that is  synthesized.  This
              difference means that two different  proteins can be expressed from one primary
              transcript of  RNA.  The cell can respond to hormones such as insulin which 
              control the alternative splicing very quickly.  In this  case, protein kinase C
              beta II is more effective than  protein kinase beta I in enhancing insulin
              effects on  glucose transport.  The actual factors controlling  alternative
              splicing of PKC beta are unknown.  We want to  identify these factors and
              determine how insulin can  regulate alternative splicing so that cells can
              alter their  physiological responses to hormones such as insulin.  ***
