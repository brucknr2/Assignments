Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              provides  continued support for research on vanadium phosphates by Dr. Jon
              Zubieta of the Chemistry  Department, Syracuse University.  A variety of
              synthetic techniques will be used to produce  novel structures containing
              vanadium oxide and phosphate.  Hydrothermal methods will be used  to produce
              large polyhedral arrays of these components, and attempts will be made to 
              incorporate other metals such as Ti, Zr, Mn, Fe, and Mo into the arrays. 
              Arrays with different  arrangments will be prepared from vanadoarsenates and
              vanado-organoarsonates.  Polyfunctional  ligands will be used to connect
              clusters together into nanometer-scale structures.  All types of  arrays will
              be structurally and magnetically characterized, and tested for their ability to
               incorporate organic cations.    The long-term goal of this research is to
              develop rational sythetic procedures for microporous  materials based on
              transition metal/oxoanion frameworks.  The synthetic conditions needed for 
              sythesis of these materials are not well known, but molecular arrays with a
              great variety of  structural features have been prepared.  Because these
              compounds are thermally stable, they are  attractive candidates for cataysts
              and catalyst supports, whose variety of structural forms could  produce
              catalysts of various selectivities and reactivities.
