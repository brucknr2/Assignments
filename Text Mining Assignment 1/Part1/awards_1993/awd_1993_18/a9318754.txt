Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9318754  Gaisser  The South Pole Air
              Shower Experiment (SPASE) consists of a large  (about 20,000 square meters)
              array of 24 scintillation detectors.   It was originally designed to search for
              ultra high energy (>100  TeV) gamma rays, but since it was first built in 1989
              it has  evolved to become a part of one of the most comprehensive high  energy
              astrophysics observatories in existence.  In conjunction  with other
              instruments at Pole, SPASE will continue its search for  sources for very
              highest energy cosmic rays, and will also be a key  component of what will
              become the most sensitive instrument on  Earth for the measurement of the
              masses of cosmic rays with  energies above 100 TeV.    This award provides
              funds for the continuation of the operation of  SPASE, to somewhat improve its
              capabilities and to relocate it in  the newly established Astrophysics Sector,
              about one kilometer from  the South Pole station.    SPASE is supported by a
              collaboration between the Bartol Research  Foundation of the University of
              Delaware and the University of  Leeds, England.  Several other institutions are
              also involved in  the overall high energy astrophysics experimental effort at
              South  Pole.  ***
