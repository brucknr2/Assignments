Abstract    :
              9318212  Lohmann  This award supports a project to develop the methods for
              extracting seasonal  temperature variability information from mollusk shells
              that represent coastal marine  sites in the Antarctic Peninsula during the
              latest Cretaceous and early Tertiary.  The  climatic records will be based
              primarily on stable isotopic analysis of annual growth  bands preserved in
              aragonitic bivalve shells of several taxa from sedimentary  sequences exposed
              on Seymour Island.  The goal of this work is to add information  about seasonal
              variations in temperature to interpretations of long term climate change  over
              the late Cretaceous to early Tertiary interval.  If the method can be proven,
              these  high resolution seasonal temperature records would represent an
              important aspect of  the long-term climatic history of the region.  ***
