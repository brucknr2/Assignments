Abstract    :
              9318034  Arp      This proposal is requesting support for a symposium on the 
              strategies and adaptations of organisms that live in environments  containing
              hydrogen sulfide.  The objective of the symposium is  to bring together
              scientists from different disciplines (e.g.  physiology, microbiology, ecology,
              molecular biology) to present  a current overview of the state of knowledge. 
              The discussion  will be on a variety of organisms in different habitats.  The 
              speakers are also from different geographic areas, and include  many women and
              young investigators.  It is hoped that this  meeting will provide both a
              synthesis of what has been learned as  well as new directions for the field.
