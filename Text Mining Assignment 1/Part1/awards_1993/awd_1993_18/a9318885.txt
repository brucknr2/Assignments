Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Alec Wodtke will investigate the role of bimolecular  
              transition states in vibrational energy transfer in highly vibrationally  
              excited molecules.  The vibrational dependence of intermolecular energy  
              transfer will be studied over a wide range of energy above and below the  
              chemical transition states for endothermic chemical reactions in a   variety of
              different systems.  In these experiments the excited species   will be created
              using Stimulated Emission Pumping (SEP).  The main system   for study is the
              diatomic molecule NO, but experiments will also be   performed on the HCN - HNC
              isomerization, leading to some of the first   experimental information on a
              molecule larger than a diatomic.    %%%  In this project Wodtke will use laser
              techniques to put large amounts of   energy into vibrational motions of the
              chemical bonds of several   molecules whose reactions are important for
              understanding atmospheric   chemistry.  Such excited molecules can undergo
              chemical reactions which   unexcited species will not.  This effort is relevant
              to understanding   global warming, ozone hole formation, and the creation and
              remote sensing   of nitric oxide, a known catalyzer of ozone destruction.
