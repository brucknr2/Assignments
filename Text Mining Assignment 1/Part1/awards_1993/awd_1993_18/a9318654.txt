Abstract    :
              Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) is a technology with  promising
              prospects for increasing the capacity of Wireless  Communications Networks
              (WCN's).  By employing low-cost arrays of  antennas and sophisticated signal
              processing techniques, SDMA  provides directional radio transmission and
              reception capabilities  which dramatically increase the number of simultaneous
              links that  can be supported on a single frequency channel.    The basic SDMA
              components - emitter location estimation, spatially  selective transmission and
              spatially selective reception - were  validated during the Phase I research
              effort by a series of half-  duplex receive-only and transmit-only experiments.
               The proposed  Phase II effort is to build a fully functional,full-duplex, SDMA
               prototype for analog cellular telephones (AMPS protocol).  This  prototype
              will be used for SDMA algorithm refinement and  development, and will serve as
              a data collection platform for SDMA  radio-frequency environment studies.  The
              Phase III effort will be  to conduct operational tests with the assistance of a
              cellular  service provider.    The market potential for a system that provides
              increased capacity  in wireless information/communication networks is immense. 
              Over  200 million domestic and foreign subscribers are predicted by the  year
              2000 in a $100 billion annual market.  Current systems are at  or near capacity
              in a market which is one-fifth as large, so  techniques for increasing capacity
              are vital to the industry.
