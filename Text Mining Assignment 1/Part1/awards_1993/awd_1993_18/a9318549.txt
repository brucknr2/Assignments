Abstract    :
              9318549  Oswald         Physiological function in adults results from a complex 
              interplay of genetic and environmental factors that act during  development, as
              well as  adaptations that can occur during  adulthood. The nature and extent of
              the interactions among these  factors is poorly understood. It is the goal of
              this research to  help understand how these factors interact in one particular 
              function: the ability to conserve water by producing concentrated  urine.      
              The PI will study the urine concentrating ability (UCA) of  the white-footed
              mice. These mice are an important prey species  in the biological community.
              and naturally occur in a wide  variety of habitats from  very moist to very
              dry. They thus  provide a sort of "natural experiment" that allows us to
              examine  the effects of different environments on kidney function. To 
              distinguish between differences  due to long-term genetic changes  between
              populations of mice on the one hand, and short-term  developmental responses on
              the other, the PI will also study mice  raised in the laboratory under
              different condition of water  availability. Because UCA depends not only on the
              kidney itself,  but also on the control of kidney function by hormones, the PI 
              will perform a variety of analyses on tissues from the mice. The  PI will
              measure the levels of the hormone vasopressin in the  blood and in the gland
              that produces it, as well as the kidney's  responsiveness to vasopressin. The
              PI will use light and electron  microscopy to study the internal structure of
              the kidney.       The importance of this study lies in its contributions to 
              understanding environmental influence on the development of  basic
              physiological processes, and to understanding the extent to  which this key
              species in the biological community can respond to  changing climatic
              conditions.  ***
