Abstract    :
              9318370   Hartman  Bradley University with participation and support from major 
              educational institutions and industry, and a strong working  partnership with
              CICNet, the state of Illinois Central Management  Services (CMS), and with
              considerable networking experience  within its member shop, has developed a
              communications network  known as netIllinois.  NetIllinois request support to
              provide Internet connection to  thirteen (13) Illinois colleges and
              universities (Barat College,  College of Lake County, Columbia College, Eureka
              College,  Heartland Community College, Illinois Wesleyan University, John  A.
              Logan College, John Wood Community College, Kaskaskia College,  Milliken
              University, Parkland College, Prairie State College,  Quincy University).  The
              requested connections will support connectivity to  netIllinois, CICNET,
              NSFNET, and the greater Internet.  It will  also provide access to state,
              regional, and national computing  resources and databases; and foster
              communication and  collaboration among teachers, students, scholars, and
              researchers  at these institutions and their peers within the worldwide 
              education and research community.  The network will provide a consistent
              statewide architecture for  NSFNET access for a broad variety of entities
              engaged in  education and research.  This cooperative network will provide 
              gateways to regional, national, and international networks and  will be
              consistent with their standards.  It will further the  institutions' work in
              enhancing the state's economic development  through a well-educated workforce,
              accessible training  opportunities, and research and development partnerships. 
               Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative  projects and
              sharing of resources between institutions, including  those outside the state.
