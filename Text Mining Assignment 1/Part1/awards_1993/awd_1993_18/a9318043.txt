Abstract    :
              9318043  Kassam-Adams  The proposed project's primary objective is to create a
              multi-  campus network, to be referred to as MedNet, based on the INTERNET  and
              connecting clinicians, librarians, educators, students,  researchers, and
              administrators working at several regional care  centers and hospitals in the
              central Virginia region.  Connecting  these patient care providing institutions
              to the INTERNET will  provide them easier access to the information services
              available at  the University of Virginia (UVA) Health Sciences Center along
              with  the many resources available through the INTERNET.  This project  will
              also be the basis for a demonstration proto-type for  connecting isolated,
              rural health care centers to regional  hospitals via an existing network
              (INTERNET) in order to facilitate  clinical consultations, patient care, and
              continued education. As  a result, the project will serve as a limited test of
              a larger,  more robust, regional health information network.  The project's
              goals can be achieved by connecting the various  regional health care centers
              and hospitals to the INTERNET and by  building an easy-to-use, menu driven,
              system to coordinate access  to the services offered by the University of
              Virginia Health  Sciences Center and other institutions linked to the INTERNET.
               The University of Virginia Health Sciences Center will purchase and  install
              all the necessary hardware and software to connect upto  five (5) regional care
              centers and hospitals to the INTERNET.  UVA  will also develop an INTERNET
              accessible MedNet Information Center  that provides electronic mail-boxes,
              bulletin board services,  electronic conferencing, and an events calendar for
              use by MedNet  participants.
