Abstract    :
              9318946  Sheng    The proposed work will focus on the following aspects of the 
              high temperature superconductor processing and  characteristics:  a) systematic
              elemental substitutions for  the existing layered high temperature
              superconducting  materials;  b) design and synthesize new layered 
              superconductors with new structure;  c) to identify possible  superconductivity
              at about 200K thallium-based ceramics; and  d) to improve the flux pinning
              capabilities of the existing  thallium-based superconductors for practical
              application.  The Principal Investigator is one of the inventors of the 
              thallium-based superconductors.  %%%  The proposed studies are directed toward
              the objective to  discover new and superior oxide superconductors and to 
              improve the existing superconductors for high tech  applications by increasing
              their flux pinning capabilities.  ***
