Abstract    :
              9318888  Asada    This research will explore a new methodology for  robotic
              assembly by using active and adaptive manipulation  techniques. Instead of
              simply receiving sensor information from the  process and generating control
              signals as functions of sensor  signals, positive control actions are taken by
              actively shaking the  end effector and perturbing the control commands in order
              to reduce  friction, better observe the process, fine tune the control 
              parameters, and seek a better control law.  Specific research  issues include; 
              how to tune the dither frequency and amplitude to  optimize the suppression of
              friction, how to monitor the assembly  process by taking the correlation
              between the imposed dither and  the resultant force measurement, and how to
              improve the assembly  operation through progressive learning.
