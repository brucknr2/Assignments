Abstract    :
              9318819   Welker     The Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections at the
              University of  Wisconsin and at Michigan State University represent an 
              incomparable unique set on brain anatomy representing existing  mammals from
              all over the world.  It is the largest collection of  its kind, containing over
              a half million anatomical sections from  over 150 species including members of
              50 Families from 17 different  Orders of Mammalia.  It has been assembled over
              decades, and  includes specimens from many animals that represent important 
              groups but now are rare, and even endangered, prohibiting any  collection of
              more material.  This project will make basic catalog  data avaliable over the
              Internet network for worldwide use.  These  data will include a complete list
              of over 375 sectioned and stained  mammalian brains, photographic images of
              each brain from standard  views, and textual data about each brain with scanned
              color images  of selected sections stained for either cell bodies or myelin 
              sheaths.  A catalog also will be published together with examples  of brain
              photographs and photomicrographs to illustrate the high  quality of the stained
              sections.  This work will provide a new kind  of worldwide access to the main
              features of this unique collection,  to allow comparative neuroanatomists to
              see whether data they seek  for their work may already be available and useable
              through this  collection.  The impact will be not only on neuroscience and 
              comparative anatomy, but on production of electronic catalogs for  other
              biological collections in museums or universities, and on  ecological and
              evolutionary studies of worldwide mammalian  biodiversity.   ***
