Abstract    :
              9318738  Goldman    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Ronald N. Goldman, 
              Professor of Computer Science, Rice University, to conduct with  Dr. Hassan
              Said, Department of Computer Science, Universiti Sains  Malaysia, Penang, a
              U.S.-Southeast Asian workshop on computer  aided geometric design (CAGD).  This
              award will support the  participation of ten U.S. scientists/engineers and
              eight others  from Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand.  Nine Malaysian 
              participants are supported from other sources.    CAGD is becoming increasingly
              important in manufacturing and is  an area of great interest to computer
              scientists and engineers.   At the same time, countries in the ASEAN
              (Association of  Southeast Asian Nations) region have taken a prominent
              position  in this field.  The workshop will provide an opportunity for U.S. 
              participants to exchange scientific information with ASEAN 
              scientists/engineers and to keep abreast of trends and directions  of computer
              science and engineering in that region.     This project is relevant to the
              objectives of the East Asia and  Pacific Program which seeks to increase the
              level of cooperation  between U.S. and East Asian scientists and engineers
              through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques 
              and through collaboration on problems of mutual interest and  benefit.  ***
