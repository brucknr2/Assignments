Abstract    :
                9318386  Lawler  The determination of the transition probabilities for
              elements  observed in stellar spectra is basic to quantitative  interpretations
              of the spectra.  With the availability of new  instruments which produce high
              quality spectra and the advent of  new techniques for spectral analysis, the
              need for accurate  transition probabilities has increased.  The PI will use a 
              technique he has developed, known as time-resolved, laser-induced 
              fluorescence, to determine the lifetimes of atomic levels. Combined  with
              branching ratios these allow accurate transition probabilities  to be
              determined.  With support from this grant the PI will  concentrate on
              comprehensive measurements for the iron group atoms  Co, Ni, Cr and Mn and
              measurements of light elements such as N and  C.  ***
