Abstract    :
              9318625  Bent  In order to understand how catalytic reactions take place, it  is
              important to identify and study possible reaction  intermediates which might
              exist on the surface during a  reaction under catalytic conditions.  This
              research project,  supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              is  designed to identify intermediates and reaction pathways for  reactions
              relevant to heterogeneous catalysis.  Reaction  intermediates will be generated
              and characterized on copper and  gold surfaces at low temperature by the
              decomposition of  molecular precursors and by the reaction of atomic hydrogen 
              with unsaturated molecular adsorbates.  This work will  concentrate on allyl,
              formyl and vinyl species as intermediates  in catalytic cracking and partial
              oxidation catalysis.  The  second part of this project will address the
              question of  activated adsorption of halocarbon molecules on these same 
              transition metal surfaces.  Vibrational spectroscopy and near  edge X-ray
              absorption fine structure spectroscopy will be the  primary tools used for
              these model studies.  %%%  The design of efficient and non-polluting catalytic
              chemical  processes relies on a knowledge of the mechanisms of the  transition
              metal catalyzed surface reaction.  One approach to  obtaining this mechanistic
              information is to establish the  chemical identity and reactivity of possible
              reaction  intermediates on the surface.  This research project addresses  this
              aspect of catalytic chemistry by preparing possible  reaction intermediates,
              characterizing them on the surface, and  exploring their chemistry.  The
              results of this work will help  to develop an understanding of important
              catalytic processes.  ***
