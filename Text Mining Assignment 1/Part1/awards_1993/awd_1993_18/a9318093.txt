Abstract    :
                    9318093  Guerinot  Iron is an essential nutrient for all higher plants,
              with iron-  containing compounds figuring prominently in the electron transport
               systems of photosynthesis and respiration.  Although iron is  abundant in the
              soil, the acquisition of iron is problematic due to  its low solubility at
              biological pH under aerobic conditions.  Iron  uptake mechanisms are being
              studied in the model plant system,  Arabidopsis thaliana, using biochemical,
              genetic and molecular  genetic techniques.  The focus is on the reduction of
              ferric iron  which takes place at the root surface because ferric reduction is 
              probably the primary factor in making iron available for absorption  by plants.
               The main objective is to identify genes which encode  components necessary for
              ferric reductase activity.  Three  strategies to identify such genes will be
              pursued simultaneously:  a) use of the FRE1 gene from yeast to identify an
              Arabidopsis  homolog; b) complementation of the fre1-1 yeast mutant to identify
               an Arabidopsis homolog; and c) identification of Arabidopsis  mutants with
              altered ferric reductase activity and use of such  mutants to clone the gene(s)
              involved in ferric reduction.  A study  of iron uptake in Arabidopsis should
              have application to general  transmembrance permeation processes and their
              regulation and may  ultimately lead to the construction of iron efficient plant
               varieties.  These studies should also shed light on root specific  gene
              expression and the regulation of gene expression by metals.  ***
