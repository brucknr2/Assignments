Abstract    :
              9318757  Quatrano    Zygotes of Fucus provide a model system to study the basic
              mechanisms involved in the generation of zygotic/cell asymmetry and
              partitioning of localized cytoplasmic components to the resulting daughter
              cells.  Large, single-celled zygotes synchronously develop a polar axis in
              culture that can be experimentally oriented by imposed gradients such as
              unilateral light.  Such cells represent an ideal system to study how a polar
              axis is established and how a cell directionally transports cytoplasmic
              material to a predetermined site defined by an extracellular vector.  In order
              for a light-induced polar axis to become fixed or stabilized in Fucus, a
              network of actin microfilaments in the cytoplasm and an extracellular matrix
              must be intact.  Dr. Quatrano has proposed that the fixation of a polar axis
              involves linking actin cytoskeletal filaments and cell wall fibrils through
              integral membrane proteins at the future rhizoid site.  This axis stabilizing
              complex (ASC) that structurally links the cytoplasm with the cell wall could
              serve to immobilize asymmetries at the presumptive rhizoid tip and to provide
              cytoplasmic "tracks" for vesicle transport to a targeted patch for support of
              rhizoid outgrowth.  The ASC is similar to polar structures in other systems
              (i.e., focal adhesions in mammalian cells), and the characteristics of its
              formation in Fucus is remarkably like other polar cells (i.e., budding yeast
              and polarized epithelium).  In this grant, Dr. Quatrano proposes two major
              questions:  (1) Does the ASC provide the structural basis for the targeting and
              retention of vesicles and gene products localized  in the emerging rhizoid, and
              what are the critical linkages that stabilize this complex with respect to axis
              fixation and tip growth?  (2) Are gene products and mechanisms of polar bud
              formation in yeast conserved in the formation of the ASC, vesicle recruitment,
              and rhizoid growth in Fucus?  If so, can these products also be detected in
              other plant cells undergoing polarized, asymmetric cell divisions?  More
              specific aims are to characterize the proteins localized in the complex and to
              identify the critical linkages between components that are required for the
              asymmetries to become stabilized.  To assess the role of specific proteins in
              the fixation process and to test various structural models of the complex, Dr.
              Quatrano proposes to interfere with the function of specific proteins by
              microinjecting antibodies into the zygote.  He will observe the dynamics of the
              complex forming in response to external gradients by using confocal microscopy.
               Fluorescently labeled actin and various dyes will be microinjected into the
              zygotes to follow the assembly of the microfilament network and Golgi vesicles
              at the targeted site.  Also, specific mRNAs that are localized in the
              developing zygote will be identified and characterized and used as reporters to
              determine the role of the ASC in their asymmetric distribution.  Finally, Dr.
              Quatrano has shown that antibodies raised to neck filament and ras-like
              proteins that are required for polar bud formation in yeast also recognize
              proteins in Fucus.  Using primers from conserved regions in these genes, he has
              identified clones from brown algae that have sequence similarities with the
              yeast products.  He will test the functional similarities of these algal genes
              by complementation tests in yeast.  He will isolate other polarity genes from
              Fucus by complementing yeast polarity mutants with Fucus cDNA libraries.  If
              any of the Fucus genes that have structural and functional homologies with the
              yeast polarity genes are found in higher plant cells, he will determine  if
              they are specifically expressed in plant cells undergoing polar, asymmetric
              divisions.  ***   # #!#"###$#%#&#'#(#)#*#+#,#-#.#/#0#1#2#3#4#5#6#
