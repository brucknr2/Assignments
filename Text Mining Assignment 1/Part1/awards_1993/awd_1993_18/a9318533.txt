Abstract    :
              OPP-9318533  Walsh  The goal of this project is the implementation of a regional
              model of the arctic atmosphere-land system for use in the Flux Study of the
              ARCSS LAII (Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions) program. Specific objectives are
              (1) to simulate the land-atmosphere interactions that control the hydrology and
              the trace gas fluxes over the northern Alaskan region, and (2) to project
              changes in the climate and surface forcing of this region.  The atmospheric
              simulations utilize the NCAR/Penn State mesocale analyses provide the lateral
              forcing.  The surface exchanges will draw upon a coupling to soil-vegetation
              and hydrological models under development in other Flux Study projects. 
              Mesoscale topography, vegetation and soil data, also provided by other Flux
              Study projects, will be incorporated into the model.  The regional model
              provides framework for the scaling-up of the Flux Study's plot, tower and
              aircraft measurements of the surface fluxes.  Finally, output from a global
              circulation model will be used to drive the regional model in a series of
              greenhouse-induced climate change experiments, thereby providing
              high-resolution scenarios of regional climate change for assessments of future
              trace gas fluxes.  ***
