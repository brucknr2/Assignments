                                        ABSTRACT                                  AST-9318745 
              KOUPELIS, Theodoros    A two-dimensional analytic model for outflows (jets) in 
              galaxies will be developed.  It will be used in part on the  approach of first
              finding the integrals of motion of the  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations
              describing the flow.  The development of a one-dimensional analytic model in
              which  the system of the ideal MHD equations is projected onto the  jet axis
              (the narrow-jet model) will be completed.  Using  these models an investigation
              of the relative importance of  different physical mechanisms on the collimation
              and  continuous acceleration of outflows from a variety of  astrophysical
              objects will be conducted.  The first  objective of this project is to find the
              allowed ranges of  values of the physical parameters at the jet origin (e.g., 
              magnetic field strength, density, etc.) for an outflow to be  possible, and to
              study its evolution as the physical  conditions close to its source change
              continuously.  The  goal is to study the physics of the regions at the origin
              of  jets by using the information provided by observations of  the outflow
              along its length.  The second objective is to  examine the effects of different
              pressure distributions and  magnetic field strengths in the medium surrounding
              the  outflow on its collimation and evolution.  The goal is to  study the
              propagation and stability properties of outflows  in different environments. 
              Using appropriate values for the  parameters of interest or, when available,
              the limits  imposed by the observations of  specific outflows and the 
              environments, the theoretical results will be compared with  numerical
              simulations, and with outflows from active nuclei,  neutron stars, and
              prostars.  ***
