Abstract    :
              9318528  Everett  This project addresses the central hypotheses of the Arctic
              System Science LAII Flux Study by examining spatial (local and regional) and
              temporal (interannual to interdecadal) variations in soil active layer
              thickness.  This is done on representative landscapes by using different
              probing and soil coring approaches (grids, transects, and point data). 
              Standard 1 km x 1 km grids are located in different landscape units across the
              Alaska Arctic Slope.  The LAII sites, which are shared by other Flux Study
              projects, were selected in most cases based on availability of long-term data
              sets including soil thaw and local climate records.  The study relies upon high
              frequency, site specific determination of active layer thickness as a function
              of climate, soil properties, and landscape units (geobotanical complexes).  The
              historical boundary between the base of the recent soil thaw and the upper
              permafrost is established by coring the frozen ground and observing the
              distribution and morphology of the ground ice.  The thaw depth measurements are
              used to validate or modify active layer models and to assess climate change
              upon the arctic tundra ecosystem.  The carbon status of the soils and
              near-surface permafrost are established across landscape units and serve as a
              basis for carbon balance extrapolations to regional scales.  ***
