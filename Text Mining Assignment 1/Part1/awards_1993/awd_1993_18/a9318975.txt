Abstract    :
              9318975  Bergin      Grand Rapids Community College requests support from NSF
              for  connection of its campus network to NSFNET.  MERIT is the midlevel 
              network located in the state of Michigan that will provide  operations and
              network information services.  It will give Grand  Rapids Community College a
              56 thousand bits per second connection  to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per second)  National Backbone network.    The college needs
              greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail system.   Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative 
              educational resources.
