Abstract    :
              9318724  Oguz    Theoretical and experimental research is to be carried out on 
              the generation of bubbles in a liquid near the free surface of  the liquid. The
              investigator already has demonstrated that a  particular bubble generator
              configuration is able to produce  much smaller bubbles than has been possible
              so far. The scheme  involves introduction of a gas cavity into the device.The 
              research is to further explore performance and explain, through  modeling, the
              mechanisms involved.         Generation of microbubbles has useful implications
              in gas-liquid  reactors, floatation columns, waste water treatment plants, and 
              aerators in general.  ***
