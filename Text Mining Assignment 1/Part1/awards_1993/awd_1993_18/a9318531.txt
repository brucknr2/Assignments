Abstract    :
              The goals of the CH4 component of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS)
              Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interactions (LAII) Flux Study are to: 1) produce regional
              CH4 flux estimates, and 2) perform field experiments that will elucidate the
              controls and feedback on CH4 and CO2 emission from tundra environments.    The
              region flux estimates will be made using time series chamber measurements of
              CH4 flux at permanent sites along a transect covering a range of physiographic
              provinces.  The locations and times of measurements will be coordinated with
              atmospheric CO2 studies of, with vegetation mapping studies, and with soil
              chemistry studies.    The field experiments will involve manipulations of soil
              temperature and water table level, jar and core experiments at a range of
              temperatures and moisture contents, and a series of isotope labelling
              experiments.  The experiments will provide information on CH4 oxidation to
              temperature and moisture changes, and the role of recently-fixed carbon in CH4
              and CO2 emissions. These experiments will be performed in collaboration with
              other LAII-Flux investigators.
