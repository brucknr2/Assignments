Abstract    :
              9318422  Lorenz  The PI will investigate various aspects of atmospheric 
              predictability and climate determinism, using concepts from the  theory of
              dynamical systems.  He will base these studies on  numerical integrations of
              relatively low-order mathematical models.   These will permit the use of large
              ensembles.  The procedures can  then be transferred to larger models,
              presumably with smaller  ensembles, if this proves desirable.  The PI will also
              continue to  seek the true significance of the very low dimensionalities for
              the  atmosphere or the climate system (obtained by processing sequences  of
              observations of a single variable) that have been appearing in  the recent
              literature.    This research is important because it will provide a fundamental
               base of knowledge upon which climate prediction models will be  developed.
