Abstract    :
              9318817  Berman  University of California, San Diego has just been given the 
              opportunity to acquire from DoD (NRaD) an 8K CM-2.  This machine is  a SIMD
              machine and provides a distinctly different programming  model than that of
              machines at UCSD and the San Diego Supercomputer  Center (SDSC).  Acquisition
              of the CM-2 would provide a major  resource for our teaching and research. The
              CM-2 would be  enormously useful to the Parallel Computation Lab, CSE
              Department  and UCSD in three areas:  teaching, research and heterogeneous 
              computing.
