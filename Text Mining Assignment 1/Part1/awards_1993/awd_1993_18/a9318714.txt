Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist  the Department of Chemistry at the University of Denver in the
              purchase of an upgrade  of its existing EPR.  This equipment upgrade will
              enhance research in a number of areas  including the following:          1.   
              Electron Spin-Electron Spin Interactions          2.    Alzheimer's:  The Role
              of Radicals          3.    Mechanisms of Myocardial Reperfusion Injury         
              4.    The Environments of Metals in Metalloproteins          5.    EPR Imaging 
                      6.    Coordination versus Ion Pairing          7.    The Active Site of
              T7 RNA Polymerase          8.    The Nature and Reactivity of Soot          9. 
                Probing the Palmitoylation Site of Rhodopsin with Spin Labels    An electron
              spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain  information
              about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules.  It may also be used
               to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals which are often
              essential for the  initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical
              reactions.
