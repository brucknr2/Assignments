Abstract    :
              9318681  Ryan    All vertebrates use their forelimbs for locomotion whether  it
              be for walking, swimming or flying.  Yet there is a  great deal of diversity in
              forelimbs:  The wings of a bird  are anatomically different from the wings of
              bats, the  flippers of a seal, and the legs of a mouse.  Despite these 
              structural and functional differences,  the neurons from  the brain and spinal
              cord responsible for controlling  movement are thought to be "wired" in
              basically the same  manner in all vertebrates.  This has come to be known as 
              the motor control conservatism hypothesis.  In this  research, Dr. James Ryan
              will test the conservatism  hypothesis by locating and comparing the
              populations of  neurons controlling forelimb movements in vertebrates that  use
              a primitive type of locomotion (lizards) with those  that use more advanced 
              types of locomotion (bats and birds).  For example the split  second maneuvers
              of a flying bat as it homes in upon a moth  illustrate the precise sensorimotor
              control of the forelimbs  that is possible.  Bats are the only mammals capable
              of  powered flight, and they evolved flight independently from  birds.  These
              three organisms represent  ideal models for  the the comparative study of
              locomotion control by the  nervous system.  Ultimately, this research will lead
              to the  formation of a general model of the neural control of  vertebrate
              locomotion.  ***
