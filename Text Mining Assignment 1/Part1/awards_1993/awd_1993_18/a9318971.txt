Abstract    :
              Integrating adaptive fault tolerance and real-time systems is an  important
              research area needed for many applications such as  robotics, air traffic
              control, automated manufacturing, and space  exploration.  Typically,
              researchers work in one or the other of  these two areas.  We propose a
              cooperative activity between the  University of Massachusetts which will supply
              the real-time  expertise and CNR-Pisa which will provide the adaptive fault 
              tolerance expertise.  The main technical objective of the  cooperation is to
              develop basic research results for adaptive fault  tolerant systems that
              dynamically address real-time constraints,  but at the same time provide system
              level, a priori minimum  guarantees.
