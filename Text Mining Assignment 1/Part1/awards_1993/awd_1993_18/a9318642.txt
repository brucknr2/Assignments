Abstract    :
              Losos  9318642   The lizard genus Anolis is among the largest vertebrate genera,
              with more than 300 described species.  Half of these occur in the Caribbean. 
              Of particular interest are the anole faunas on the islands of the Greater
              Antilles, where each island has a set of ecologically and morphologically
              distinctive species, called ecomorphs.  Comparisons across islands indicate
              that the sets of ecomorphs on each island are essentially identical, although
              they are not closely related.   This study will explore the biological basis
              for anole diversification using two approaches.  First, laboratory studies of
              DNA sequences will be used to determine relationships among species.  Second,
              the processes by which species have adapted to different habitats will be
              studied using a combination of laboratory and field studies.  Field
              observations will determine how species differ in habitat use.  Functional
              studies will then investigate whether morphological differences among species
              have functional consequences that result in species being best adapted to the
              habitat they use in nature.
