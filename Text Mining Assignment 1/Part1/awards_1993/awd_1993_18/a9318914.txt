Abstract    :
              9318914  Wicker       Over the past several years much progress has been made in
               determining the environmental meteorological parameters that  determine the
              structure of thunderstorms.  In particular, an  important discovery is the
              factors that are highly correlated with  the storms (know as supercell storms)
              that typically produce  tornadoes.       Even though most major tornadoes are
              spawned within supercell  thunderstorms, not all supercells produce tornadoes
              and the  tornadoes themselves span a broad spectrum of severity.         In
              this research the Principal Investigator will investigate  the large scale
              environmental conditions that control the intensity  and longevity of
              tornadoes.  Advances in computational power and  numerical techniques permit a
              numerical modeling parameter study of  supercell/tornado systems.  The goal is
              to simulate the observed  spectrum of tornadic storms by systematically varying
              the  environmental wind shear and buoyancy.         Successful completion of
              this research will increase  understanding of tornadoes and potentially provide
              operational  meteorologists with better information for predicting severe 
              tornadic events.  ***
