Abstract    :
              9318788  Dwyer  This is an award to provide support for research, the objective 
              of which is to determine conditions under which bacteria that  have been shown
              to be capable of degrading organic contaminants  of soil can be utilized in
              field-scale decontamination of soil.  The target organic compounds this
              investigator plans to work on  are diaryl ethers, compounds that as a class
              include the dioxins,  substances of great pollutional significance.  The
              organism the  investigator plans to use, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, has 
              been found to degrade diaryl ethers, a property attributable to  its containing
              genes for enzymes that cleave these compound's  ether bond.      Results of
              this research are expected to include the substrate  range for this organism
              and its enzymes, the conditions that are  appropriate for its use in
              field-scale operations and the  stability of its genes for degradation of the
              target substances.   This research is expected to provide guidance for the
              conditions  under which microorganisms may be evaluated for their use in  
              decontamination of soils and provide the basis for engineering  design of
              systems to remove the target contaminants from soil.  ***
