Abstract    :
              9318529  Hobbie  The research, a part of the ARCSS LAII Study, will take place
              in arctic Alaska in the headwaters of the Kuparuk River.  There are four parts:
              (1) the measurements of flux of carbon as CO2 and organic matter from
              groundwater/land to streams and lakes and eventually, in the case of CO2, to
              the atmosphere (calibrations to be carried out with the help of the Chapin
              project); (2) the measurement of the concentration of nutrients (PO4, NO3, NH4)
              and dissolved and particulate organic matter in the Kukparuk River in order to
              calculate flux to the ocean; (3) the enhancement of a General Ecosystem Model
              (GEM) to include anaerobic conditions and phosphorus cycling in order to
              understand and predict the interactions of variations in vegetation, soil, and
              carbon cycling on CO2 and methane transfer to the atmosphere; and (4) the
              enhancement of a Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) to include permafrost in the
              soil moisture calculations in order to make spatially explicit regional
              estimates of CO2 exchange between vegetation/soil and the atmosphere.  ***
