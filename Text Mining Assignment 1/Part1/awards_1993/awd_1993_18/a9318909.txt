Abstract    :
              9318909  Yodh       Support for research is granted to faculty at the University
               of California at Irvine to study characteristics of high energy  cosmic rays,
              especially gamma rays and neutrinos, incident on  earth.  The goal is to
              establish the identity of as yet unknown  sources and explicate still unknown
              acceleration mechanism(s).  Those are subjects of intense current interest and
              activity.  One  major thrust is the development of MILAGRO, a new air-shower 
              detector that makes use of Cerenkov radiation produced by shower  parties in a
              large pool of water.  The other is continued  deployment and operation of
              neutrino and muon detectors, the  AMANDA array, in the ice at Antarctica that
              serves as an extended  Cerenkov radiator.  ***
