Abstract    :
              9318593   Bruce                 Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests
              support from  NSF for connection of nine schools including: the Maine Technical
               College System comprising six schools (Washington County  Technical College,
              Southern Maine Technical College, Northern  Maine Technical College, Kennebec
              Valley Technical College,  Eastern Maine Technical College, and Central Maine
              Technical  College), Goddard College, Providence College, and Saint Anslem 
              College to the New England Academic Research Network (Nearnet)  which is the
              NSF mid-level network that serves the New England  area.  A primary goal of
              NEARnet is to facilitate collaborative  projects and sharing of resources
              between institution, including  those outside the state.       NEARnet will
              provide operations management and information  services and it will give the
              universities and colleges a  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per  second) National Backbone network.       The each of the
              universities has written a description of  its organization and a statement of
              the benefits of Internet  access that it expects including: greater
              functionality and  network speed to be able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and  make file transfers along with being able to implement a more 
              reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit  from the
              links.  This is also a unique opportunity for the  schools to explore
              innovative educational resources.  Their  diversity will expose NEARnet to a
              broader range of user  requirements.  Nearnet will use the information obtained
              by  serving this diverse group for the benefit of New England's  academic and
              research community.  ***
