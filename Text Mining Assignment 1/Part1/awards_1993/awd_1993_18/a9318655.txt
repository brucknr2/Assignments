Abstract    :
              9318655  Johnson  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program of the 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. C. S. Johnson of the University of  North Carolina
              proposes to develop an improvement in current  NMR technique to allow the study
              of ultra slow translational  (diffusional) motions of molecules and molecular
              aggregates in  condensed media.  An existing standard commercial NMR 
              spectrometer will be modified to allow the use of large  magnetic field
              gradients and high resolution NMR in the same  experiment.  This project is
              exploratory in nature and is  supported through a Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research (SGER).  %%%  The limitations of present methods of Nuclear Magnetic 
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy make for difficulties in studying  the transport
              of large micelles and vesicles, restricted  diffusion in cells and porous
              solids, and the simultaneous  measurement of diffusion rates of various size
              probe particles  in tight gels and polymers.  The exploratory research to be 
              undertaken in this project seeks to overcome these limitations  through the
              combination of several new techniques and adapting  them for inclusion in a
              standard commercial spectrometer.  The  successful execution of this plan will
              bring about a major  advance of the NMR technique and will have important 
              consequences and great benefits to several applied areas, such  as polymer
              chemistry, biochemistry, and the dynamics of glassy  materials.  ***
