Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Missouri-St.
              Louis in the purchase of a 300 MHz NMR.  This equipment will   enhance research
              in a number of areas including the following:  Chemistry   of Diplatinum
              Complexes Bridged by Dppc or Dppm Ligands, Metallaboranes   Derived from
              Pentaborane(9) and Hexaborane(10), Silicon Oligomers and   Polymers; Synthesis
              of Heavy-Metal X-ray Contrast Agents, Dioxirane   Chemistry, and the
              Preparation and Reactions of Chiral 1-Hydroxy   Phosphonates and
              Phosphonamides.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool   available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure
              of   molecules.  It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize  
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the   dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.   Access to   state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are   carrying out frontier research.
               The results from these NMR studies are   useful in areas such as polymers and
              catalysis, and in biology.
