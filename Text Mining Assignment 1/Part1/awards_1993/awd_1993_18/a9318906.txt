Abstract    :
              9318906  Case     This project tests the hypothesis that ecological interactions
              are responsible for the dramatic body-size changes in three independent island
              reptile systems: Sauromalus, Cnemidophorus, and Crotalus in the Sea of Cortez,
              Mexico.  The history of body size changes is inferred from the phylogenetic
              relationships among populations, as reconstructed from nuclear and
              mitochondrial DNA sequences.  This historical information is used to test
              hypotheses of the population genetic response to sympatry with competing
              species.  This research uses new technques to test long-standing hypotheses
              about character displacement.  %%%  This research is important because it
              allows re-evaluation of some of the classic examples of population genetic
              response to competition (character displacement) and yields new insights into
              the roles of competition vs. predation in the genetic change of populations and
              structure of communities.  Understanding the effects of ecological interactions
              of island species can be applied to conservation and management of small
              isolated populations (e.g., sensitivity to introduced predators and
              competitors).  This research also provides scientific background for sound
              implementation of endangered species legislation.  ***
