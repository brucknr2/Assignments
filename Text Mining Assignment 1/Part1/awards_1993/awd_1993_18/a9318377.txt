Abstract    :
              9318377  Bartschat       The research focuses on the collision of electrons and 
              positrons with atoms and ions.  Special attention is paid to spin-  dependent,
              coherence and correlation effects and the development  of reliable numerical
              methods to permit the calculation of the  scattering observables.  Perturbative
              and non-perturbative  techniques are explored and the reduced density matrix
              formalism  developed earlier used to provide a systematic description of the 
              connection between the theory and the experiments.  Accurate  atomic data will
              be generated for applications to stars, lasers  and plasmas.  ***
