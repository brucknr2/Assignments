Abstract    :
              9318693  Emanuel  Advances and product development in power electronics resulted
              in  increased levels of harmonics in power systems and the associated 
              problems.  Substantial research activities are underway to study  harmonics
              from a systems point of view, as well as at device  levels.  To meet the need
              for exchange of ideas among researchers  in this area, the International
              Conference on Harmonics in Power  System, ICHPS was established in 1984.  ICHPS
              is a biennial  conference.  The sixth conference is scheduled for September 21-
               23, 1994 in Bologna, Italy.  This block travel grant will help  young faculty
              and established researchers from the United States  to exchange ideas and
              present results.  ***
