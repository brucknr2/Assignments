Abstract    :
              9318054  Ikle  The National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory
              Medicine  is a world-class research and clinical care institution  specializing
              in chronic respiratory allergic, and immunologic  diseases.  Its
              physician-scientists depend on access to current  knowledge bases and
              state-of-the-art telecommunications.  This  proposal is to connect the nearly
              completed internal network at  National Jewish (NJCNET) to the NSFNET through
              Colorado Supernet  using T1 service.  The co-investigators have designed and 
              implemented the NJCNET and have the expertise needed to support  TCP/IP.  This
              connection will greatly benefit the institution by  providing access to BITNET
              and Internet mail, GENBANK and EMBL data  bases, FTP, supercomputers, image
              transfers and financial support  to maintain this connection in the future.
