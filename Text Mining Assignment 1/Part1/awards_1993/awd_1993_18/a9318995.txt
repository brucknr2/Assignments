Abstract    :
              Schlegel   9318995     This projects supports the Research of a cultural
              anthropologist from the University of Arizona.  the project tests a hypothesis
              of adolescent behavior:  that adolescents who spend more time with adults
              differ in measurable ways (display less aggressiveness, competitiveness, and
              anti-social behavior) from those who spend more time with peers.  The project
              will study adolescent apprentices in Germany, a country with a well-developed
              system of apprenticeship.  A sample of industrial apprentices will be compared
              with a matched sample of school attenders in relations with family, peers and
              unrelated adults for various aspects of adolescent behavior.  The subjects will
              be observed in their natural settings, the classroom and workplace. 
              Questionnaires and tests to measure their relationships and attitudes will be
              administered.   This research is important because adolescent violence is a
              major problem in contemporary society, and increases in our understanding of
              its causes will help us control it.  In addition the project is timely since
              the German in American.  This study should help us assess its applicability for
              our nation.
