Abstract    :
              9318786  Zimmerman        This award provides for adding five institutions to
              the state  mid-level network ARKnet, and extending ARKnet's capability to 
              provide service to less populated areas and new Internet users.    Faculty and
              students at the newly connected campuses will benefit  from access to the
              resources of the Internet, including libraries  and supercomputers.  In
              addition, they will be able to communicate  and collaborate with colleagues at
              other institutions in pursuit of  research and educational projects.  The award
              provides partial  support of this project for two years.  ***
