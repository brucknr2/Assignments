Abstract    :
              9318600  Waterson       Chesapeake College requests support from NSF for
              connection  of their campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel 
              network located in the southeastern United States.  It will  provide operations
              management and information services and it  will give Chesapeake College a 56
              thousand bits per second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per  second) National Backbone network.       Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.   By linking to the mid-level and national
              networks Chesapeake  faculty and academics will maintain a position of
              leadership in  research and educational innovation by profiting from remote 
              access to super computer centers, data bases and information  services, high
              speed communications, file transfer and remote  login, and access to library
              resources. This is also a unique  opportunity for the school to explore
              innovative educational  resources.
