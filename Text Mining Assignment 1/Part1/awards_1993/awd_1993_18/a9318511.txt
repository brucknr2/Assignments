Abstract    :
              9318511  Yablonka  The value to academic health care organizations of access to
              the  Internet has been well documented in the literature.  A  Northwestern
              Memorial Hospital Network (NMHNET) connection to the  Internet would provide a
              critical service as Northwestern Memorial  Hospital (NMH) moves forward in the
              delivery of care to our  patients and the support of research and education. 
              NMH has deployed a high speed network over the last several years.   NMH is
              continuing this substantial investment with a new high  performance, TCP/IP
              network infrastructure to support advanced  clinical applications such as:
              clinical decision support systems,  diagnostic imaging and the creation of
              electronic patient records.  This grant request will provide over the two years
              a connection to  the Internet with the appropriate hardware and an opportunity
              to  improve patient care, research and education at Northwestern  Memorial
              Hospital.  NMH needs to provide a connection for hospital clinicians, 
              researchers and educators to communicate with NIH, NLM,  Supercomputers in
              Champaign, IL, and colleagues and co-  investigators across the nation via
              E-Mail.  We must remove these  barriers in order to enhance our support of
              patient care, research  and education.  The connection of NMHNET to the
              Internet is a vital link to our  clinicians, researchers and educators.  These
              initiatives being  undertaken with our partners at Northwestern University
              Medical  School (NUMS) constitute the development of a highly advanced  medical
              center network providing services to our diverse clinical,  research and
              academic staffs.  ***
