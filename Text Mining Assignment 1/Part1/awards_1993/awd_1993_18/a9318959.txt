Abstract    :
              9318959  Jones and Rudnick    This research will involve both an observational
              and theoretical  study of supernova remnants and radio galaxies.  The goal of
              the  research is to determine the physical processes regulating the  transport
              of high-energy particles and magnetic fields in diffuse  radio sources.  The
              principal investigators are experts in this  research area.  ***
