Abstract    :
              Project Summary  ATM-9318493, Ching-Sheng Wu    This proposal will study the
              basic theory of the plasma emission  process as well as its applications.  The
              issues to be addressed  include:  (1) the effect of velocity dispersion of the
              beam  electrons, (2) finite spectra of backscattered Langmuir waves and  low
              frequency turbulence, (3) effect of quasilinear relaxation of  the beam
              instability on the emission process, (4) nonlinear effects  on mode coupling,
              (5) application of the theory to emissions  associated with the bow shock, and
              (6) discussion of type II and  type III radio bursts.
