Abstract    :
                     9318958  Rodriguez  This project involves the dissertation research of a
              student in  cultural anthropology from the University of New Mexico.  The 
              student will conduct ethnographic research on middle-class White  "lifestyle
              migrants" living in Taos, NM, an Indian town.  The  research will see how these
              people define their lives in contrast  and distinction to the dominant more
              commercially-oriented  society.  Using techniques of participant observation,
              survey  interviews with individuals and with local institutions, the  student
              will analyze this counter-current in contemporary US  society.   This research
              is important because it adds to the scientifically  trained capacity of the
              nation, and will provide a case study of  an alternative life-style. 
              Understanding how this sector of  society defines itself will provide a
              valuable comparative case  to enrich our understanding of contemporary life in
              the US.  ***
