Abstract    :
              9318469  Michl  Several different areas of research will be explored.  
              Singlet-triplet energy gaps of biradical-like molecules will   be determined by
              matrix-isolation electron energy loss   spectroscopy (EELS). Through bond
              contributions to spin-  orbit coupling and the mechanisms of spin density  
              delocalization in saturated radicals and biradicals using   molecular orbital
              theory will be analyzed. New   perfluorinated biradical-like species will be
              prepared under   conditions of matrix-isolation and a new approach to  
              selective reactions in matrices will be explored.   Automerization between the
              two Kekule structures of   cyclobutadiene will be investigated as well. The
              results   will provide new understanding of the chemical bonding and  
              properties of reactive intermediates, and the role they play   in thermal and
              photochemical reactions.   %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program
              supports the   continuing research of Professor Josef Michl at the   University
              of Colorado. Normally, there are a total of four   other atoms and pairs of
              electrons associated with carbon.   Carbon radicals are typically reactive
              intermediates and   have a total of three other atoms and pairs of electrons  
              plus one additional electron. Species containing one and two   radical sites
              will be studied by sophisticated spectroscopic   methods at low temperatures.
              Interactions between the two   radical sites will be addressed. Calculations of
              the   structure and energy of these species will be carried out as   well to
              complement the experimental results. These results   will provide a new
              understanding of bonding and properties   of reactive intermediates, and their
              role in thermal and   photo-initiated reactions.  ***
