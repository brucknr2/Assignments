Abstract    :
              9318399  Widder    The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution will develop and
              test  a three dimensional, laser imaging and tracking electro-optical  system
              (3-D LITES) for applications in biological oceanography.   This laser-scanning
              system will provide precise 3-D data in near  real time while combining high
              resolution (1.25 mm) with a large  field of view (0.5 m) and a long working
              distance (1 m).  The  system will be for use both in the laboratory and in
              situ.  3-D  LITES is a modification of a system developed for the the Navy for 
              high resolution mapping of surfaces underwater.  The image closely  resembles a
              video image with 200 to 800 lines of resolution, but  each frame is a 3-D data
              file where the "pixels" comprising the  image have a "Z" component in addition
              to an X,Y coordinate, thus  providing true three-dimensional imaging  within
              the sensor's field  of view.  The work proposed is to adapt this design for
              mapping  real time movements and microscale distribution patterns of marine 
              organisms.    The principal application is the measurement of spatial 
              distributions and swimming patterns of motile organisms in the open  ocean. 
              This represents one of the greatest challenges in  biological oceanography and
              holds the key to understanding  zooplankton behavioral ecology by answering
              such basic ecological  questions as how co-occurring species distribute
              themselves in  space relative to each other and relative to the physical
              variables  in their environment.          Dr. Edith Widder  Harbor Branch
