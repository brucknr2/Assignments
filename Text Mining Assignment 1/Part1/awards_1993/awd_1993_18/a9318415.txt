Abstract    :
              9318415  Kingery    The objective of this research is to improve the reliability
              and  effectiveness of additive-promoted sintering of ceramics.  This  process
              constitutes the vast majority of competitive commercial  practice.  This
              requires researching the distribution of additives  (i.e., their wetting
              behavior) and chemistry during the entire  process of heating and cooling.  The
              scientific importance of this  study is to refocus sintering paradigms away
              from formally correct  but often irrelevant isothermal models towards the more
              complex and  substantial changes occurring during heating and cooling.    %%%% 
                The practical importance of the research will be to establish a  basis for
              obtaining enhanced quality and reliability and  performance by using a sol-gel
              process for optimally positioning a  small fraction of critical additive.  ***
