Abstract    :
                    9318942  Kay      Forbears of New World Monkeys reached South America some
              time in the early Cenozoic, but because of an inadequate fossil record there
              are only indirect lines of evidence about when or from where - direct from
              Africa remains a distinct possibility.  The first record of them in South
              America occurs at Salla, Bolivia, and dates to about 25 million years ago.  The
              goal of this collaborative field project is to collect and  date accurately 
              more material of the earliest South American primates at Salla and possibly
              elsewhere in Bolivia and to explore Argentina strata of similar age, and
              earlier, where it is very likely ancestral forms should be found.  This project
              will shed much needed light on the origins of these primates who evolved in
              parallel with our own ancestors in Africa.  ***
