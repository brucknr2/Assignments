Abstract    :
              9318271  Bultman     This project investigates the interactions between
              ovipositing Phorbia flies and the ascomycete fungal host on which their larvae
              feed.  Preliminary data suggest that the fly provides spore dispersal service
              to the fungus and that the relationship between the two organisms is
              mutualistic and possibly coevolved.  The project investigates the similarities
              between this system and tightly coevolved plant-pollinator mutualisms.    %%% 
              There is general agreement among ecologists that mutualisms are very important
              in ecosystem function, but that they are understudied and poorly understood
              relative to other biotic interactions.  This research is important in that it
              will describe a potentially new and widespread mutualistic relationship, and
              give us better insight into the conditions that lead to the origins of
              mutualisms.  The results of this research may be of application in studies of
              the health and function of ecosystems.   ***
