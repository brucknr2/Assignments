Abstract    :
                     9318878  McCay         This project involves the research of a cultural 
              anthropologist from Rutgers University.  The behavior of  fishermen and
              managers in three fishery management systems in  North America will be studied:
              the Atlantic sea clam fishery in  the Mid-Atlantic region, the inshore
              groundfish fishery in Nova  Scotia, and the small inshore dragger fishery in
              Newfoundland.  The project will interview workers about the common-property 
              management system known as "individual transferable quotas"  (ITQs).  These are
              intended to restore some of the positive  effects of market regulation and
              improve incentives of fishers to  conserve.       This project is important
              because it will advance our  understanding of the management and conservation
              of a vital  natural resource system: our fisheries.  Better understanding of 
              the attitudes, behavior, patterns of incentives, effort,  ownership and
              governance will help inform public and professional  debate about natural
              resource conservation.  ***
