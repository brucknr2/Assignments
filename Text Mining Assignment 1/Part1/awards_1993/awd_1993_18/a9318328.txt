Abstract    :
              9318328  Kim       The objective of this project is to investigate the 
              functionality and the specificity of neural networks formed from  artificially
              cultured biological neurons on a VLSI chip, with  respect to information
              processing.  To achieve the objective,  methods to understand signal
              transmission and processing in  neurites, as well as the methods to understand
              the operation of  neural networks formed from biological neurons.  For this
              project,  there are three goals:  1) investigate the dynamic neuronal 
              connectivity of function-specific neurons of the snail, Helisoma  trivolvis on
              a VLSI chip with real time measurements.  2)  test the  hypothesis that the
              synapsin molecules play an important role on  the information processing as the
              neighboring associated molecules  of cytoskeleton of neurites.  3)  develop a
              nonlinear dynamic  Hebbian-like learning algorithm based on the mathematical
              modeling  of the experimental results.  The proposed research will develop a 
              new discipline called synthetic neuroscience, i.e. the use of  electronics
              technology to assist the quantitative understanding of  the brian, bringing
              together neuroscience and electronic chip  engineering.
