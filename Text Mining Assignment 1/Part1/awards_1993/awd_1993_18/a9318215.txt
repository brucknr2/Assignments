Abstract    :
              9318215  Krueger    Humans and other animals use the peptide hormone ACTH to
              adapt to  stress.  ACTH is released by the pituitary gland and travels in  the
              blood to the adrenal glands, where it binds to receptors on  the adrenal cell
              surface.  This binding stimulates steroid  hormone (cortisol) production by the
              adrenal cells.  Cortisol  helps the body cope with stress.  The focus of this
              project is to  determine how the different parts of the ACTH molecule bind to 
              and stimulate the receptor on the surface of the adrenal cell.  Peptides are
              composed of amino acids, and the contribution of the  side chains of the
              individual amino acid residues will be  measured.  This will be accomplished by
              comparing the receptor  binding and stimulation properties of the normal ACTH
              peptide  with a series of synthetic ACTH peptides that have only a single 
              hydrogen atom substituted for the normal, larger side chain at a  specific
              amino acid site.  By comparing the properties of the  normal and synthetic
              peptides, the contribution of each specific  amino acid side chain to receptor
              binding and activation will be  determined.  The information obtained will
              provide an accurate  and detailed molecular model hormone-receptor interaction.
