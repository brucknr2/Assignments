Abstract    :
              9318662  Eyler       This proposal is for "High-Resolution Laser  Spectroscopy
              of Excited Atomic and Molecular States."  It  involves several studies on the
              structure and dynamics of  excited states in small atoms and molecules.  The 
              experiments share a common experimental approach,  multiphoton spectroscopy
              with narrow band lasers.  They  include precision measurements in fundamental
              atomic and  molecular systems, the study of near threshold dissociation  of
              diatomic molecules, the systematic investigation of  excited-state dynamics in
              small molecules and the  development of new spectroscopic techniques.
