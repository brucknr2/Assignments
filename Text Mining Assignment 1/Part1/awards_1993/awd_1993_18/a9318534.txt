Abstract    :
              The major objective of this research is to assess the quantity and quality of
              soil organic matter (SOM) and to test the roles of the active fractions of SOM
              in CO2 and CH4 production in the arctic ecosystem.  The first phase of this
              project involves the sampling and full characterization of soils on the flux
              study sites which were jointly selected by all PIs involved in this
              collaborative proposal.  The soil characterization will provide database for
              extrapolating the results of gas flux studies over a geographic base.  The
              second phase involves the isolation and characterization of the inactive and
              active organic fractions in soils and soil solutions; then identification of
              the microbial active fractions using respiration experiments under controlled
              conditions and the active components as substrates for gas flux (both CO2 and
              CH4) using carbon labelling experiments.  It is hypothesized that the major
              sources of CO2 and CH4 production are the active fractions in SOM.  The
              composition, quantity of active and inactive organic carbon fraction and their
              turnover rate are expected to closely relate to gas flux on different arctic
              ecosystems.  This project is part of the larger integrated Land/Atmosphere/Ice
              Interactions (LAII) Flux study of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program.
