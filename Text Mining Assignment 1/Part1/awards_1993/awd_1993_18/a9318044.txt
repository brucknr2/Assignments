Abstract    :
              9318044  Burke   Funds will be used for improvement of the Insect Collection of
              the Department of Entomology, Texas A&M University.  This collection of
              approximately 1,290,000 specimens has grown rapidly in recent years and is
              particularly rich in material from the southwestern United States and Mexico. 
              It is the major insect collection in the area.  There is a need to reorganize
              portions of the collection, sort material to loanable units, raise the
              curatorial level of selected groups, rehouse and integrate important donated
              materials, and continue basic computerization activities.  Funds are
              specifically needed to (1) employ students on a part-time basis to assist in
              curation and name-capture and (2) purchase cabinets and drawers for storage of
              the increasing numbers of specimens generated by inventory and research
              projects, donations and other acquisitions.  The addition of the Roy O. and
              Conway A. Kendall Collection of Lepidoptera of approximately 100,000 specimens
              with extensive associated biological data is in progress.  Cabinets and drawers
              will be purchased to rehouse this collection in TAMU.  The visiting specialist
              program has been very successful in the past in getting material sorted for use
              in research projects and obtaining identifications; this program will be
              continued.  A strong commitment of new funds ($79,910) has been made to the
              proposed project by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station.  The requested
              support will allow continued development of the collection as a major regional
              resource for insect systematics.
