Abstract    :
              9318074  MORSE   Until very recently the Chinese government would not allow
              specimens to leave the country for study.  This project is based on careful
              efforts by the Principal Investigator to foster collaboration with Chinese
              scientists and to receive governmental approval/permission for such
              collaboration.  Extensive collecting in six provinces of the People's Republic
              of China during the summer of 1990 established that approximately 70% of the
              caddis fly fauna (Insecta: Trichoptera) is undescribed.  These insects are
              extremely important as indicators of water quality.   This research project
              will involve description of this understudied group of insects from China,
              revisionary studies for four families, and biogeographic analyses.  It is
              thought that the biogeographic analyses of the Chinese faunas will be very
              important to understanding the biogeography of these insect groups on a
              worldwide basis.  Two Chinese scientists will be trained in modern systematic
              methods for study of Trichoptera at Clemson University.  %%%  Caddis flies are
              important indicators of water quality.  However, for the People's Republic of
              China, these and other aquatic insects remain poorly studied.  This project
              will describe many new species recently collected in China and undertake
              studies of relationships among species and their biogeographic distributions. 
              Fostering collaboration with scientists from the People's Republic of China is
              an important element of this project.  ***
