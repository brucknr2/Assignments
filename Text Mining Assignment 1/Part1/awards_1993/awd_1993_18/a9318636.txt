Abstract    :
              9318636  Ceyer  A knowledge of the detailed dynamics of heterogeneous reactions 
              will put our understanding of surface reaction chemistry on the  same footing
              as our detailed understanding of elementary gas  phase reaction processes. 
              This research project, supported in  the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, is designed to  obtain this sort of detailed information.  Surface
              processes  which are induced by the collision of gas phase species with  the
              surface are the focus of the work of this project.  Molecular beam methods will
              be used to investigate the reaction  of molecules with the surface and species
              adsorbed on the  surface, as a function of the translational energy of the 
              incident molecule.  The hydrogenation of ethylene on the nickel  surface and
              the packing of hydrogen atoms into the bulk of the  nickel sample are two
              processes which will be explored in  detail.  Electron energy loss spectroscopy
              will be used to  identify possible reaction products and surface intermediates 
              which may result from the collision induced surface chemistry.  %%%  The basic
              understanding of the dynamics of surface chemical  reactions is important for
              our developing understanding of many  technologically important surface
              processes such as  heterogeneous catalysis and electronic materials processing.
               This basic understanding can best be obtained by exploring the  dynamics of
              elementary surface reaction processes using the  molecular dynamics methods
              developed to examine gas phase  reactions.  This project addresses the specific
              question of  collision activated surface chemistry, using variable energy 
              molecular beam studies to probe important model systems.  From  this detailed
              experimental information, a framework for  understanding surface chemical
              processes will develop.  ***
