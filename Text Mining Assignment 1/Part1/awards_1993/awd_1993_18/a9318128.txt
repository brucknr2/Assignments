Abstract    :
              9318128  Smith  The purpose of this proposal is to generate funds to upgrade 
              our VAX 6000-410 computer to a DEC 7000-610, to increase our  disk space by
              adding new SCSI disks, to purchase fiber-optic  hub equipment allowing the new
              computer to be connected  directly to the Medical Center's fiber-optic network,
              and to  add two new X-terminals and a color printer for public use.  The
              computer currently functions as a shared central  resource within the Medical
              Center providing data bank  storage and computing power for nearly all research
               scientists at the Medical Center whose work involves  molecular biology. The
              current machine is overwhelmed by the  rapidly increasing number of users, and
              the rapid growth of  the molecular biology databases. Additionally, the
              resource  is required to fill an expanding role as a file and compute  server
              for a rapidly growing number of users who are  choosing to purchase high power
              Macintoshes, IBM-PCs and  workstations, in addition to serving a large group of
              peer  reviewed and funded projects requiring basic computing  facilities.   
              The goal of our shared resource is to enhance current  services and to provide
              new facilities, some of which are  under development in the Medical Center.
              These resources  consist of new databases, tools for the analysis of  molecular
              structure, and selected image processing tools and  resources. Our goal is to
              support research on biological  structure at all levels from the molecular to
              the cellular.  The PI and the CoPIs are currently--and will continue to be- 
              -major users of the computer system. They share a commitment  to a shared
              computing resource and are involved in projects  that will enhance its value to
              the Medical Center and the  broader international research community.
