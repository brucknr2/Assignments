Abstract    :
              Evans  9318433       Many organisms, when faced with unfavorable environmental 
              conditions, respond by slowing or arresting growth and development.   At one
              end of the scale, animals such as bears have the ability to  slow metabolism by
              hibernating.  At the other end of the spectrum,  many higher plants have the
              ability to more or less arrest growth  and development of seeds until favorable
              conditions are  experienced.  This dormancy of seeds has led to the existence
              of  seed banks--populations of dormant, viable seeds in the soil.       Despite
              the profound implications for the ecology and  evolution of plants, virtually
              no information is available on how  dormancy affects other traits.  Two
              experiments will address this  question in the short-lived perennial desert
              mustard Lesquerella  fendleri.  The first explores whether past evolution has
              led to  adaptive syndromes of germination requirements and  post-  germination
              traits.  The second asks how evolution could act by  performing an artificial
              selection experiment.       This work has applied value in several regards. 
              Efforts to  understand plant responses to environmental change will remain 
              incomplete (and perhaps erroneous) until we understand the  important, but
              neglected, seed stage of the life cycle.  Knowledge  of the seed stage is also
              critical for plans to revegetate human-  impacted lands.
