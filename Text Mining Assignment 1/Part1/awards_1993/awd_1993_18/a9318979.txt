Abstract    :
              9318979  Dixon            This project connects four sites to NSFNET through
              THEnet over  a 56 kbps line.  They are Baylor College of Dentistry, Dallas 
              Baptist University, LeTourneau University System, and the Alliance  for Higher
              Education office.   Faculty and students will benefit  from access to the
              resources of the Internet, including libraries  and supercomputers.  In
              addition, they will be able to communicate  and collaborate with colleagues at
              other institutions in pursuit of  research and educational projects.  The award
              provides partial  support of the project for two years.
