Abstract    :
              9318085  Kling  Lake Victoria serves as the basic food and economic resource for
              millions of people.  The last 30 years have produced remarkable and alarming
              changes in the ecosystem.  Phytoplankton productivity has increased 2 to 3-fold
              and the biomass has increased 10-fold.  Water clarity, oxygen content, and
              silica concentrations have been dramatically reduced.  The tremendous diversity
              of endemic fishes (300 species) has been all lost, due in part to the
              components that have contributed to these changes:  (1) alteration of the food
              web by the introduction of Nile perch, (2) eutrophication caused by nutrient
              inputs from the basin or atmosphere, and (3) recent changes in climate that
              have modified water-column structure and caused mixing patterns to favor
              development of bluegrass algae and the loss of oxygen in bottom waters.  %%% 
              Although there is evidence that each of these components has contributed to the
              changes in Victoria, it is impossible to determine their relative importance
              and how they interact die to our complete understanding of ecosystem function. 
              Theory predicts a weak trophic cascade in a tropical lake, a forecast clearly
              at odds with the observations in Lake Victoria.  The phosphorus-driven
              eutrophication models fail to explain the change in productivity of the lake. 
              Is it because the outcome of biogeographical control is different at high and
              uninterrupted temperatures, or is there an unrecognized feedback through
              trophic interactions or variations in climate?  In this research we will
              explore these apparent contradictions and test these basic but unproved
              hypotheses.  %%%  A survey and experimental approach will be used to deduce the
              specificity and intensity of nutrient limitation, and to estimate the rates of
              important biological and chemical processes.  A modeling approach will be used
              to identify the important predator-prey interactions, and to synthesize these
              results into quantitative estimates of herbivore impacts.  Food web interaction
              models will be employed to  evaluate previous, current, and future trophic
              states of the lake.  We will use the paleolimnological record of change in
              diatoms, pigments, crustaceans, and element deposition as a benchmark in
              testing the mechanisms of process regulation and their integration at the
              ecosystem scale.
