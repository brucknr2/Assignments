Abstract    :
              9318948  Hayden  Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for photonic applications
              will  be studied using a new method to measure the pressure dependence  of the
              decay of NLO coefficients at various temperatures in guest-  host, side-chain,
              and main-chain NLO polymers by in-situ second  harmonic generation.  By
              performing a systematic study of a  barbituric acid derivative in a guest-host
              and side-chain form,  the hypothesis that the relaxation of the second order
              NLO  susceptibility in a guest-host system is associated with the  motion of a
              single repeat unit will be tested.  Finally, this  study will extend the
              understanding of local polymer dynamics in  glassy materials by measuring the
              compressibility of the free  volume and pressure dependence of the shift
              factor.  The  activation volume determined from the pressure dependence of the 
              shift factor will be related to the size of the "reorganizing  units"
              postulated in the configurational entropy theory of  Adam and Gibbs.  %%%  By
              studying the relaxation of NLO materials as a function of  pressure, the volume
              associated with the reorientation of the NLO  moiety will be determined.  This
              will allow designers to develop  higher stability next generation materials for
              photonic devices  such as high-speed optical modulators, waveguide harmonic 
              generators and optical switches.
