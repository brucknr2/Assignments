Abstract    :
              9318919  Rausher       Genetic variation is the raw material for evolutionary 
              change.  Consequently, understanding the processes that produce  and maintain
              genetic variation in natural populations is a  requisite for understanding how,
              and at what rate, organisms  evolve.  In addition, understanding how genetic
              variation is  maintained in natural populations may contribute to the 
              development of strategies for conserving genetic diversity in  natural
              ecosystems.  Over the last thirty years, numerous  investigations have
              indicated that natural populations of  organisms harbor extensive amounts of
              genetic variation.   Nevertheless, although theoretical investigations have
              indicated  that there are more than a dozen processes that could maintain 
              these levels of genetic variation in natural populations, very  few definitive
              examples of any of these processes exist.   Consequently, understanding of why
              organisms are so genetically  variable is at best rudimentary.  The purpose of
              this research is  to address this issue using flower color variation in the
              annual  morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea, as a model system.  In  particular,
              the goal of this project is to determine why genetic  variation for flower
              color persists in natural populations of  this species.  Through a series of
              field and laboratory  experiments, the evolutionary forces that act on a gene
              that  influences the intensity of pigmentation (the W locus) at all  stages of
              the life cycle will be assessed.  From these  assessments, a determination will
              be made of which, if any, of  the theoretically described processes for
              maintaining genetic  variation operate on this character.***
