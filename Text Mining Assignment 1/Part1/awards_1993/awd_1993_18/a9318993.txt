Abstract    :
              9318993  Essa       This project connects Austin College to NSFNET through
              THEnet  over a 56kbps line.  Faculty and students will benefit from access  to
              the resources of the Internet, including libraries and  supercomputers.  In
              addition, they will be able to communicate and  collaborate with colleagues at
              other institutions in pursuit of  research and educational projects.  The award
              provides partial  support of the project for two years.
