Abstract    :
              9318578  Michl  This Award is made in the Office of Special Projects in partial 
              support of the 15th IUPAC Symposium on Photochemistry. The  Symposium will be
              held in Prague, Czech Republic, July 17-22,  1994. The scientific program will
              consist of 15 one-hour  Plenary Lectures, 10 one-half-hour Invited Lectures and
              two  poster sessions with as many as 300-400 posters. Participants  will be
              drawn from research institutions all over the world.  With photochemistry as
              the common theme, papers will be  presented which cover organic, inorganic,
              physical,  biochemical, polymer and industrial photochemistry.  %%%  This
              international symposium is a forum for discussion of  photochemistry broadly
              and will provide an environment for US  scientists to meet and hopefully
              establish collaborations with  foreign scientists, particularly Eastern
              European Scientists,  whom they would not likely otherwise contact. NSF support
              will  provide partial participant costs to young US investigators.  ***
