Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational  
              Chemistry Program, is a study of probe molecules in hydrogen and helium  
              clusters.  Low lying phonon states of the cluster and the interaction of  
              these states with rovibrational states of a probe molecule will be   treated by
              quantum Monte Carlo theory.   Computed quantities include   lifetime
              broadening, shifts and splittings in infrared and Raman spectra   of probe
              molecules such as  sulfurhexafluoride or diatomic iodine.  By   comparing
              theory with experimental measurements, the host-host and   host-impurity
              couplings can be determined and used to study other energy   dissipation
              processes in quantum fluids.  A second major component of   this project treats
              high energy (>1 keV) electron scattering from   clusters to study ionization
              and elastic scattering cross sections.    It has long been known that liquids
              (quantum liquids) composed of very   light atoms or molecules, particularly
              helium atoms or hydrogen   molecules, exhibit unusual properties such as
              superfluidity.   The   principal goal of this project is to test mathematical
              and theoretical   methods in the theory of these phenomena by computing
              experimentally   accessible spectral effects on small quantum clusters
              containing probe   molecules. The most immediate application of this
              fundamental knowledge   is to the theory of spacelab experiments involving
              superfluid clusters,   and to the development of improved cryogenic rocket
              fuels.
