Abstract    :
                        9318479  Slocum  Pyrimidine nucleotides are precursors of DNA and RNA
              synthesis and  pyrimidine derivatives are activated intermediates in many other
               types of biosyntheses.  These processes are of fundamental  importance to the
              growth and development of all living organisms.   In plants, little is known
              about the various mechanisms which  regulate pyrimidine biosynthesis, but most
              evidence suggests that  the important sites of regulation are the first and/or
              second steps  of the pathway, involving the enzymes carbamoylphosphate
              synthetase  (CPSase) and aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase).    The objective
              of this research is to investigate the various  molecular mechanisms regulating
              the activity of these enzymes in  plants.  This will be accomplished by cloning
              the genes for CPSase  and ATCase, purifying and biochemically characterizing
              the enzyme  proteins, and producing CPSase and ATCase-specific antisera.  The 
              nucleic acid and antibody probes will be used to investigate  expression of the
              genes encoding CPSase and ATCase in different  plant tissues and in response to
              various treatments that would be  expected to impact pyrimidine biosynthesis.  
               The genes encoding CPSase and ATCase will be cloned by functional 
              complementation in E. coli carA/B- and pyrB- mutants.  This  approach has
              already permitted the successful isolation of two  different genes (pyrB1 and
              pyrB2) encoding functional ATCases in  pea.  This plant is the first organism
              in which more than one pyrB  gene has been demonstrated.  ***
