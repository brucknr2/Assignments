Abstract    :
              Abstract  Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound - I. Goverman   Connection to
              Internet   Proposal No. NCR-9318050  Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound
              (GHS) requests funding to  connect to the Internet via the NorthWestNet
              regional network.  This will greatly aid the current projects in which GHC is 
              already interacting with a number of regional and national  partners to develop
              common data systems and form intellectual  partnerships.  GHC is actively
              pursuing a major project to  develop a workstation for clinicians.    In
              addition, the GHC has a long-standing commitment to addressing  basic research
              issues.  GHC's Center for Health Studies already  collaborates with a number of
              academic institutions, both  nationally and internationally.  These
              collaborations will be  greatly aided by an Internet connection.
