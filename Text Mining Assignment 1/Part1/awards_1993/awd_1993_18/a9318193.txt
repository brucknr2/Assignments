Abstract    :
              9318193  Hogue-Angeletti  We request funds toward the purchase of an instrument
              for  matrix-assisted laser desorption, time-of-flight mass  spectrometry
              (MALD-TOF MS) for a core laboratory with an  established record of cooperation
              and productivity. This  instrument will enable a group of investigators at
              Albert  Einstein College of Medicine to determine protein and  glycoprotein
              masses at high sensitivity. In addition to  routine analysis of protein samples
              to assess molecular  weight, purity, and to verify structures, the MALD-TOF
              mass  spectrometer will be used to: 1) identify proteins involved  in the
              formation of secretory granules and in protein  sorting mechanisms; 2) study
              the processing of processing  enzymes; 3) identify proteins and peptides
              secreted by  ependyma and choroid plexus cells; 4) characterize the taxol 
              binding site on microtubules; S) study the mechanism of ATP-  dependent
              proteases; 6) analysis of proteins rapidly  phosphorylated in tyrosine in
              response to colony stimulating  factor-l.
