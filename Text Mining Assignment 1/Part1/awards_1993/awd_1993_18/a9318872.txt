Abstract    :
              9318872  Borns  This award is for support for a one year reconaissance
              inves-tigation of reported  paleo glacial geological evidence on nunataks in
              the Executive Committee Range  of Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica.  The
              glacial/non glacial geologic record of  higher ice levels including precise
              chronology, will be documented on selected  nunataks.  The purpose of this work
              is to test the feasibility for a more  extensive study to provide glacial
              geological data for documentation of the  paleoglaciology of the inland portion
              of the West Antarctic ice sheet.  ***
