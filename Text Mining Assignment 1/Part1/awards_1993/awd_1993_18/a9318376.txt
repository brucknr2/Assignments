Abstract    :
              9318376  Herskowitz  Growth of normal cells is often regulated by growth
              factors, either  positive growth factors, which stimulate proliferation, or
              negative  growth factors, which inhibit proliferation.  The budding yeast, 
              saccharomyces cerevisiae, provides an excellent opportunity to  study the
              molecular mechanism of action of negative growth factors.   The yeast mating
              factors(a-factor and a-factor) are peptides  secreted by each of the mating
              types, a and a.  They cause cells of  opposite mating type to arrest in the G1
              phase of the cell cycle  and to differentiate by inducing expression of a
              variety contains  a seven-membrane-spanning receptor and several protein
              kinases,  which include MAP kinases.  Cell-cycle arrest ensues because 
              activity of the regulatory kinase,p34 CDC28, is inhibited.  A gene,  FAR1, has
              been recently identified whose protein plays a key role  in arresting the cell
              cycle in G1 in response to the negative  growth factors.  Genetic studies led
              to the hypothesis that FAR1  protein inhibits one of the G1 cyclins, CLN2. 
              Recent biochemical  studies show that FAR1 protein associates with the CDC28
              and CLN2  proteins and that the ability to form this complex requires that 
              FAR1 be phosphorylated by the MAP kinase, FUS3 protein.  These  studies
              demonstrate that FAR1 is the link between the signal  transduction pathway and
              the machinery that is involved in  regulating the cell-cycle.  This research is
              employing a  combination of molecular genetic and biochemical techniques to 
              address the following aims: (a) Determine how phosphorylation of  FAR1 by FUS3
              (and by p34CDC28-CLN2 ) controls activity of FAR1.   Phosphorylation sites
              shall be identified by biochemical methods;  mutant sites shall be constructed
              or otherwise identified to test  the role of these sites in vivo and in  vitro.
               (b) Determine how  FAR1 inhibits activity of the p34CDC28-CLN2 complex. 
              Immune  complexes containing CLN2 and CDC28 shall be isolated and assayed  for
              function in the presence of FAR1 protein;  mutant FAR1 proteins  (inactive or
              constitutively active) shall be identified and  analyzed to dertemine their
              ability to inhibit CLN2/CDC28 kinase  activity in vitro and in vivo.  (c)
              Explore the role of FAR1 in the  mating process of yeast.  Mutants of FAR1
              defective in a second  function of FAR1 shall be isolated and their mating
              defect  characterized.  (d) Search for homologues of FAR1 in other  organisms. 
              Homologues will be identified by functional rescue of  yeast far1 mutants and
              by nucleic acid hybridization.  %%%  These studies are relevant to
              understanding how cell growth is  regulated by the external environment, a
              fundamental problem in  cell and developmental biology with relevance to
              cancer.  ***
