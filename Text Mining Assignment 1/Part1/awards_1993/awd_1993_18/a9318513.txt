Abstract    :
              9318513  Moccia  The National League for Nursing (NLN) is in the process of 
              establishing an electronic communication network which will 1)  support active
              exchange among its national membership of nurses,,  educators, researchers,
              students, and consumers and other members  of the nursing community and 2)
              allow these same groups to access  a nation-wide database.  The connection of
              choice is Internet.   This proposed project will provide the start-up fees for
              the  network.  The National League for Nursing is the repository of data on
              over  1500 graduate and undergraduate educational programs throughout the 
              United States.  This data includes information on curriculum,  facilities and
              health care issues.  Information is also available  on practitioners, practice
              settings and research projects.  The League currently disseminates the
              information through meetings,  publications, printed reports and computer
              disks.  The Internet  connection would allow for electronic on-line access to
              and  exchange of information within the nursing community.  The dynamic 
              exchange of data would promote collegial discussion on education,  research and
              health care issues, thus expanding and enriching the  information for the
              users.
