Abstract    :
              9318565  Meserve     This project investigates the response of small mammals and
              perennial and annual plant populations to natural variation in weather
              conditions and to manipulations of predator and herbivore densities in a
              Chilean semiarid thorn scrub.  The research provides a unique set of long-term
              population data for small mammals in the arid tropics as well as data on their
              effects on plant populations.  The manipulative experiments of small mammal and
              predator densities in combination with annual weather variation (including an
              El Nino event) provide unique insights into the interactive effects of biotic
              and abiotic factors on natural populations of mammals and plants.  %%%  This
              research is important because it provides some of the first long-term data on
              the response of mammal and plant populations to short-term climate change in
              the arid tropics.  The results of this research will improve our abilities to
              understand the ecological consequences of anthropogenic climate change.  ***
