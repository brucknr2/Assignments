Abstract    :
              9318242  Bier      The goal of this proposal is to understand the function of 
              the rhomboid (rho) gene that is required for several  distinct developmental
              events including : early dorsal-  ventral pattern formation in the Drosophila
              embryo, the  formation of embryonic sensory organs, and the formation of  adult
              wing veins. rho is one of several genes (referred to  as ventro-lateral group
              genes) required for the formation of  these diverse structures. Other
              ventro-lateral group genes  encode an EGF/TGF alpha type of growth factor
              (spitz) and  the Drosophila EGF-receptor (egf-r). rho is the only known  member
              of the ventro-lateral group of genes expressed in a  spatially localized
              pattern corresponding to the cells  requiring the activity of ventro-lateral
              group genes. rho  encodes a membrane protein (Rho) and may act by amplifying 
              EGF-R signaling in response to binding the Spitz growth  factor. Because the
              EGF-R signaling pathway has been highly  conserved during evolution it is
              likely that these studies  in Drosophila will be directly relevant to other
              species,  including humans. The following are specific research goals  for this
              proposal: 1) Determine the subcellular localization  of the Rho protein. Is the
              Rho protein located on the cell  surface as predicted for a protein functioning
              as part of a  receptor complex? Is Rho located at sites of intimate cell-  cell
              contact? 2) Investigate how the Rho protein functions  biochemically and
              determine whether Rho physically interacts  with other proteins. Does the Rho
              protein physically  interact with other proteins (e.g. components of the EGF-R 
              signaling pathway)? Is Spi a ligand for EGF-R? Does Rho  mediate differential
              cell adhesion? 3) Determine whether rho  is dedicated to amplifying Spi-EGF-R 
              signaling or are other  signaling pathways also activated by Rho? Does 
              transcriptional down regulation of components of the EGF-R  pathway depend on
              rho?  ***
