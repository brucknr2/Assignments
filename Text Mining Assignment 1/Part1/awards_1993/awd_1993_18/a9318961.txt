Abstract    :
              9318961  LaFleur       Aquinas College requests support from NSF for a
              connection  of its campus network to Michnet and NSFNET.  Michnet is the 
              midlevel network located in the state of Michigan that will  provide operations
              and network information services.  It will  give Aquinas College a 56 thousand
              bits per second connection to  the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
              per second)  National Backbone network.       The College needs greater
              functionality and network speed to  be able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail  system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.   This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore  innovative
              educational resources.
