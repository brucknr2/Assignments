Abstract    :
              9318247  Jones      This research is aimed at determining the molecular 
              mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of development of a  larval caterpillar
              form into the winged, adult moth.  The  maintenance of a larval form, and the
              suppression of adult  form, is due to the maintenance of a high titer of
              juvenile  hormone during the larval stage.  The molecular mechanism by  which a
              high titer of juvenile hormone causes suppression of  genes associated with the
              adult form is not well understood.  It is the objective of the present grant
              research to  determine the mechanisms, using as a model system the  suppression
              of expression of hexamerin genes by juvenile  hormone.  In this proposed
              research, we will analyze the  regulatory promoter DNA associated with the
              hexamerin genes  for the presence of proteins that bind to the DNA in a JH- 
              sensitive manner.  By various tests, including gel mobility  shift analysis,
              DNA footprinting and cell transfection assay  with wild type and mutant
              sequences, we will narrow down to  and identify the particular DNA bases to
              which the  regulatory proteins bind.  ***
