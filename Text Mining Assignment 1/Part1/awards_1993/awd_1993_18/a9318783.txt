Abstract    :
              9318783  WERREN   Recently it has been shown that a single group of bacteria
              (Wolbachia) cause both incompatibility and parthenogenesis in many causing
              destruction of chromosomes or by preventing segregation of chromosomes in
              unfertilized eggs, resulting in generation of female offspring without the need
              of fertilization.   Wolbacia are of interest because they may be involved in
              the rapid evolution of new species in insects.  In addition, they are of
              considerable interest because of their potential uses in biological control of
              pests (e.g. by causing sterilization), improvement of beneficial insects (by
              use of parthenogenesis), and as a tool for genetic modification of both
              beneficial and pest insects.   Research described here will involve sequencing
              of two different genetic regions.  The relationships among Wolbachia from
              different insects will be determined and it will be determined whether
              parthenogenesis has evolved more than once among Wolbachia, to what extent
              Wolbachia have been horizontally transmitted among insects species, and whether
              parasitic insects are likely vectors for movement of these bacteria between
              species.  The research proposed here will provide information on Wolbachia
              relevant to their use in biological control of insects and to studies of insect
              development.
