Abstract    :
              9318183  Davis  The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides  one
              mechanism for the support of multidisciplinary teams of  scientists and
              engineers to meet the goals of the High  Performance Computing and
              Communications (HPCC) Initiative  in Fiscal Year 1993. The ideal proposal
              provided not only  the opportunity to achieve significant progress on (1) a 
              fundamental problem in science or engineering whose solution  could be advanced
              by applying high performance computing  techniques and resources, or (2)
              enabling technologies which  facilitate those advances but also significant
              interactions  between scientific and computational activities, usually 
              involving mathematical, computer or computational scientist,  that would have
              impact in high performance computational  activities beyond the specific
              scientific or engineering  problem area(s) or discipline being studied. The 
              investigators will study the application of high performance  parallel
              computing to a class of scientifically important  and computationally demanding
              problems in remote sensing-  land cover dynamics problems including generating
              improved-  fine spatial resolution data for the global carbon cycle, 
              hydrological modeling and global ecological responses to  climate changes and
              human activity. The research is  collaborative, including scientist from the
              University of  Maryland, University of Indiana, University of news  Hampshire
              and NASA's Goddard Space Center. The award will  combine research on       -new
              analysis procedures for remotely sensed data     -the integration of
              multispectral, multiresolution and       multitemporal        image data sets
              into a unified global data structure       based on        hierarchical data
              structures (i.e., quadtrees)      -the utilization of these hierarchical,
              parallel data       structures for the        representation of spatial data
              (maps and products       developed from image        analysis) and the
              development of a spatial data base       system with a     sophisticate d query
              language that scientist can use to       control the        application of
              biophysical models to global data sets       -run-time support for constructing
              scalable and       parallel solutions to      problems involving the
              manipulation of irregular data       structures such        as quadtrees   
              -parallel l/O,especially novel methods for mapping large       arrays and    
              quadtrees onto parallel disks and disk systems, and for       accessing them   
                  using low overhead bulk transfers  The development work will be conducted
              on a 32 processor    Connection Machine CM5, installed at the University of   
              Maryland, and on an IBM SP1 which we propose to obtain as    part of the
              program.  This award is being supported by the    Advanced Projects Research
              Agency as well as NSF programs in    geological, biological, and computer
              sciences.
