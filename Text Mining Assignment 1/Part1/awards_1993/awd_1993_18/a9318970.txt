Abstract    :
                9318970  Saumon    Stars with masses below about 0.08 solar masses can not
              sustain  nuclear reactions.   The existence of such objects, known as brown 
              dwarfs, could have important consequences in a variety of areas of 
              astrophysics including the missing mass problem and star formation.    However,
              it has not been possible to unambiguously distinguish   brown dwarfs from the
              very numerous M dwarfs which are similar in  luminosity and temperature.  This
              is due in large part to  deficiencies in the theoretical models which are
              compared with the  observed spectra, colors and luminosities.  With the support
              of  this grant, new more realistic model atmospheres and interiors will  be
              constructed for M dwarfs and brown dwarfs.  The spectra and  colors calculated
              from these models will allow the identification  of brown dwarfs.  ***
