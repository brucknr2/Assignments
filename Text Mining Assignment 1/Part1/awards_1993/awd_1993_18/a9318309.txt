Abstract    :
              9318309  Grodzicker    Funding is requested for a Cold Spring Harbor summer
              course  in Arabidopsis molecular genetics.  The use of Arabidopsis  as a model
              plant for the course reflects the current  research interests of many US and
              international  laboratories.  The course is designed to fulfill a growing  need
              within the plant science community for training in this  area.  The intention
              is  (1) to teach state of the art  molecular techniques to scientists who are
              already involved  in research with plants so that they can apply these 
              technologies to their own future research and (2) to teach  scientists who are
              familiar with microbial, animal or plant  systems about current research in
              plant biology using  Arabidopsis as the model plant system.  The course
              consists  of a rigorous lecture series, a hands-on laboratory and  informal
              discussions.  Speakers will provide both an in-  depth discussion of their work
              and an overview of their  specialty.  The laboratory sessions provide intensive
               training in modern techniques in plant biology.  It also  introduces
              approaches used in yeast that have the potential  to be utilized for the
              advancement of Arabidopsis molecular  genetics.  ***
