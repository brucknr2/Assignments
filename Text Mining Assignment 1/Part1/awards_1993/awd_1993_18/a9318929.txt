                  Signer 9318929 Research into plant biology is hampered by the lack of the
              technology necessary for site specific recombination.  With that as the
              ultimate goal, the specific aims of this proposal are to develop in vivo
              genetic methodology to exploit: 1.Site specific double-strand break repair by
              HO endonuclease,     which should be of value in gene targeting, mosaic
              analysis,     and marker eviction. 2.Site specific genomic rearrangements by
              FLP recombinase, which   should generate deletions, inversions and
              translocations. %%% Plant molecular biology is currently limited by supporting
              genetic technology, particularly in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  This
              project will develop in vivo genetic methodology, initially for Arabidopsis but
              in forms suitable for other plant species too.  Experiments are planned to
              exploit expression in planta of two yeast site specific enzymes, HO
              endonuclease and FLP recombinase.  Areas to be explored are gene targeting,
              marker eviction, mosaic analysis, and genomic rearrangements (deletions,
              inversions, translocations).  This technology will allow the full range of
              modern recombinant DNA technology to be brought to bear on plant systems, for
              both fundamental research and improved engineering of agronomic crop species.
