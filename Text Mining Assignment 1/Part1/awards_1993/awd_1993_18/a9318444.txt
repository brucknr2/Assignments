Abstract    :
              Pritchard  9318444  This project is a "rescue operation."  It will enable the
              International Reference Center for Avian Haematozoa, Memorial University of
              Newfoundland, Canada, to move to the Harold W. Manter Laboratory, University of
              Nebraska State Museum, Lincoln.  There, the specimens will be curated,
              integrated into the collections, added to the computer database, and serve the
              international parasitological community by continuing to receive hapantotype,
              parahapantotype, and voucher specimens of avian blood parasites, as well as
              lend specimens to qualified investigators.  The name will be retained as a
              subunit of the Harold W. Manter Laboratory.  The International Reference Center
              for Avian Haematozoa was established in 1968 by the World Health Organization
              at Memorial University of Newfoundland with Dr. Gordon F. Bennett as Officer in
              Charge.  Acute financial problems forced WHO to close most of its International
              Centers in 1974, but Memorial University agreed to support the Center with Dr.
              Bennett as Professor and Head.  In 1978, this unique Center was designated by
              the World Federation of Parasitologists as the international repository for
              avian blood parasites.  The Harold W. Manter Laboratory is one of three U.S.
              National Resource Centers for Parasitology.  Having "rescued" other threatened
              collections in the past, it offered to serve as repository and curator for the
              International Reference Center collection.  The invitation was accepted within
              hours of its receipt.
