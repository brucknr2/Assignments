Abstract    :
              Powell  9318836       Flies of the genus Drosophila play a crucial role in all 
              biological research from the most basic molecular biology through  to ecology. 
              On the order of 2400 species of this genus are known.   While Drosophila have
              been intensively studied for all kinds of  biological processes such as
              genetics, development and some aspects  of evolution, little attention has been
              paid to the phylogenetic  relationships of the many species.  A good reason for
              this is that  these small flies have relatively few good characters with which 
              such a large group could easily be placed into phylogenies using  traditional
              methods.  Recent advances in molecular biology now make  it reasonably routine
              to collect DNA sequence data on many species  of Drosophila.  The present
              proposal is to gather DNA sequence data  for a number of the most studied
              species of the genus in order to  clarify their phylogenetic relationships. 
              Once phylogenies are  available, one can map onto them various characters, e.g.
               behaviors, morphologies, etc, to gain an insight into the evolution  of these
              characters.  But to do so, one needs reliable  relationships determined by an
              independent data set, i.e. DNA  sequences.  In addition, because Drosophila is
              so well studied from  so many viewpoints, these studies will contribute to our 
              understanding of basic molecular evolution mechanisms such as the  relative
              rates of change of different types of DNA, the pattern of  change in repeated
              DNA's compared to unique sequences, etc.  So in  addition to shedding light on
              the phylogenetic relationships in the  genus, we will gain insight into basic
              processes.
