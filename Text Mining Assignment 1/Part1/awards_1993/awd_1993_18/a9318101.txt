Abstract    :
                9318101  Nadler  This is a request for shared instrumentation to image and
              quantitate ion levels and pH in physiological studies on living cells. The
              requested Noran Odyssey laser scanning con focal microscope will enhance the
              research of five members of the Department of Pharmacol ogy by allowing the use
              of novel and innovative experimental approaches. The Noran instru ment has been
              optimized for the imaging of living tissue in real time. It will be used to
              investigate the following issues: (1) effects of regulatory substances on
              stimulus evoked sodium and calcium accumulation in glutamate nerve terminals,
              (2) NMDA receptor plastici ty in kindling and ontogenesis, (3) role of axon
              sprouting in facilitating or inhibiting seizure discharge and propagation, (4)
              role of calcium transients in regulating the cell cycle, (5) role of calmodulin
              in regulating insulin secretion from pancreatic  SYMBOL 98 \f "Symbol"  cells,
              (6) mechanism by which excess calmodulin leads to cardiac hypertrophy, (7)
              effects of glutamate and GABAA recep tor activation on intracellular calcium
              and chloride levels in hippocampal neurons, (8) effects of growth stimuli on
              intracellular pH, (9) role of protein phosphatase activity in the regula tion
              of cellular calcium levels and DNA synthesis, (10) induction of the protein
              phosphatase inhibitor 1 gene by calcium and (11) initiation of seizures by
              spontaneous action potential firing in axon terminals. These studies are aimed
              at understanding a variety of signaling mechanisms fundamental to cellular
              physiology. They will also help explain changes in cellular physiology and cell
              cell communication that  occur in response to excessive or inju rious stimuli.
