Abstract    :
              9318035  Lehman  Lake Victoria, the second largest lake on earth, has
              experienced striking changes during recent decades. Water transparency, oxygen
              concentrations, nutrients, algae, and fish communities have all changed
              markedly from historical conditions. The lake now supports an introduced fish
              fauna of reduced species diversity than in its indigenous state, and the future
              yield of the fishery is in doubt. Three hypotheses have been advanced to
              account for these changes: (1) nutrient inputs have accelerated from
              atmospheric sources and regional land use, (2) changes in regional climate have
              altered physical mixing of the lake, permitting prolonged periods of
              stratification and deoxigenation, and (3) the introduction of piscivorous fish
              has disrupted food webs reducing total fish biomass. This research will test
              hypothesis (1) critically, and provide a basis for subsequently testing the
              others if this hypothesis proves false.   %%%  This research is part of the
              goals of IDEAL, the International Decade for East African Lakes. Discrimination
              of these hypotheses could prompt remedial action, permit prediction of future
              states of the lake and its potential to produce harvestable protein, and
              provide the data to evaluate and interpret paleostratigraphic records. The
              results from this research will be instrumental in a reconstruction of the
              changes in Lake Victoria during the past century, and in calibrating the
              responses of continental regions to global and regional climate change over
              much longer time periods.
