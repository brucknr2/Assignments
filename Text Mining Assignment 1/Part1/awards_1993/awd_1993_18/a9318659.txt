Abstract    :
              9318659  Berndt            This workshop was held on November 11-13, 1993 in 
              Charleston, South Carolina.  It brings together leading individuals  from the
              international research community to explore ways of  improving the ability to
              assess, measure and otherwise understand  the economic and organizational
              impacts of information technology  investments.  Participants at the workshop
              come from a variety of  different disciplines -- computer science, organization
              theory and  economics, as well as from different research organizations -- 
              academia, national and international statistical organizations, and  national
              research funding centers.  Particular attention is devoted  to the availability
              and/or necessity of data sets amenable to  testing alternative hypotheses. 
              Another important purpose of the  workshop is to set an appropriate research
              agenda to guide national  research and statistical funding agencies and the
              Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Proceedings of
              the  workshop are to be published as a special edition of the journal, 
              Economics of Innovation and New Technologies, in the Summer of  1994.
