Abstract    :
              9318815  Diaz       Mercyhurst College requests support from NSF for connection
              of  its campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network  located in
              the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide  operations management and
              information services and it will give  Mercyhurst College connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45  million bits per second) National Backbone
              network.       The College needs greater functionality and network speed to  be
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file  transfers along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail  system. Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.   This is also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore  innovative educational resources.
