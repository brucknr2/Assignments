Abstract    :
              This study of molecules adsorbed on a solid surface is supported by the   NSF
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program.  The molecule-phonon  
              interaction is treated quantum mechanically using a Hamiltonian operator   that
              can include multiple phonons, as well as the hindered translational,  
              rotational, and vibrational modes of the molecule, and all possible  
              interactions of these degrees of freedom.  Both weak (one phonon) and   strong
              (multi-phonon) interactions can be described.  The nature of the   trapped
              state with regard to desorption, relaxation, and hot atom   chemistry is
              treated.  The effect of varying the component of beam energy   parallel to the
              surface is also studied.    Computer models are used in this research to study
              the motion of   molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces.  The goal is to gain
              fundamental   knowledge of the principles of surface chemistry, which in turn
              relates   to chemical processes of great practical importance such as
              heterogeneous   catalysis.  Computer modeling is a widely used theoretical tool
              for the   study of such processes.  The special role of this research project
              is to   test the validity of various mathematical and physical approximations  
              commonly employed in these computations.  In particular, the laws of   quantum
              mechanics, rather than classical mechanics, are applied, and the   interaction
              of the molecule with one or more phonons (quantized lattice   vibrations) are
              treated.
