Abstract    :
              9318637  Maxwell        The American Mathematical Society requests a grant in
              the amount of  $62,371 for the twenty-fourth AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar in Applied
              Mathematics,  to be held in the summer of 1994.  Previous seminars were held
              annually or at  two or three year intervals since 1957 for a total or 23
              seminars.        The 1994 topic, "Dynamical Systems and Probabilistic Methods
              for  Nonlinear Waves", was selected by the 1992 AMS-SIAM Committee on Applied 
              Mathematics.  Members of the Organizing Committee for the 1994 Summer seminar 
              are: David W. MCLaughlin (co-chair), Philip Holmes (co-chair), Percy Deift, 
              James M. Hyman, C. David Levermore, Y. Sinai, and C. Eugene Wayne.        The
              organizers propose and AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar in 1994 which would  focus on
              the use of probabilistic and dynamical systems methods in the study  of
              nonlinear waves.  The conference program will be specifically geared toward 
              advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D recipients who will soon be 
              participating in these fast developing and important fields.        The 1994
              Summer Seminar will be held during a two-week period in  June/July 1994, at the
              Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in  Berkeley,California.  The Society
              will be responsible for making suitable  arrangements for lecture and seminar
              rooms, and for coordinating local  administrative matters with MSRI staff.
