              RICHARD NIELSON    Existing architectural precast curtain wall panels may have
              nonductile connection details that are prone to failure in strong earthquakes. 
              They also may have experienced significant corrosion of the reinforcing steel. 
              Corrosion of the bars anchoring the panel connection inserts likewise reduces
              the strength and ductility of the panel connections.  This project conducts a
              study to investigate remedial procedures which will increase the seismic
              integrity of the panels during earthquakes.    Successful rehabilitation
              schemes are developed to satisfy the following criteria:  (1) provide adequate
              strength to resist both seismic code design forces and forces generated by
              structural response to actual earthquake ground motions, (2) provide adequate
              ductility to accommodate realistic interstory drifts, (3) accommodate a variety
              of structural framing schemes including both steel and reinforced concrete, (4)
              be practical and economical,  requiring minimal disruption of a building's
              functions, and (5) reduce or eliminate the possibility of corrosion of the
              panel reinforcement, and possibly reduce the seismic dead load and lateral
              design load for the structure.    Research tasks to achieve these are:  (1)
              Construct and test nonductile connection details.  (2) Design appropriate
              repair schemes.  (3) Construct and test repair details and verify their
              performance.  (4) Perform dynamic analyses of full-panel repair systems.   
              This project is supported under the NSF Initiative "Repair and Rehabilitation
              Research for Seismic Resistance of  Structures."    curtain wall panels may
              have nonductile connection  details that are
