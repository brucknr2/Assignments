Abstract    :
                  This award will support participation by graduate students, postdocs  and
              senior researchers in the summer program in Molecular Biology, to  be held at
              the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications, July  5-29, 1994.  This
              program will bring together molecular biologists and  mathematicians who have
              worked on protein sequencing, protein folding,  molecular dynamics and the
              various mathematical, statistical, and  computational aspects involved, in
              order to increase interaction, to  discuss future directions and to speed up
              progress in the area.  The  first two weeks of the program will deal with
              linear representations of  genomic information:  genetic and physical mapping
              and DNA sequencing.   The last two weeks will be devoted to numerical and
              analytic models for  the simulation of the spatial structure of proteins, DNA
              and RNA.
