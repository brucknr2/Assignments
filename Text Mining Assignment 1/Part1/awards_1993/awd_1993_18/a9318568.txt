Abstract    :
              9318568  Miller    Many studies have detected enzymes in fungi (fungi that are 
              symbiotically associated with the roots of trees) that may  decompose organic
              matter in laboratory studies. Other  studies imply that these symbiotic fungi
              are not capable of  such decomposition in the field even though they may
              outgrow  true saprotrophic fungi in the soil. Several possibilities  exist for
              this apparent contradiction. The symbiotic  association may alter the behavior
              of mycorrhizal fungi so  that enzyme production is not possible. Another
              possibility  is that ectomycorrhizal fungi may only be able to decompose 
              organic matter during times when sugars produced by their  host are not being
              produced in sufficient quantities. At  such times, the saprotrophic machinery
              of mycorrhizal fungi  may be able to obtain energy along with required mineral 
              elements from organic substrates. A third possibility is  that at least some
              reports of enzymatic activity in the  laboratory are subject to criticism
              because the research has  been accomplished under conditions that are very
              different  from what would most likely be encountered by these fungi.  We
              propose to examine the mechanisms of ectomycorrhizal  fungi that may allow them
              to better compete with  saprotrophic fungi. We will accomplish this by
              conducting  experiments in the laboratory using specially designed root 
              chambers that allow growth and manipulation of a portion of  the fungus
              separate from the roots and rooting substrate  while still in symbiosis with
              the tree. This approach will  allow us to investigate the saprotrophic reposes
              by  ectomycorrhizal fungi at a level that heretofore has not  been achieved.
