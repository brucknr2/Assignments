Abstract    :
              9318196  Battelle  The Whitney Laboratory, a research institute of the
              University of  Florida, was established in 1974 and is dedicated to the use of 
              marine animals as experimental models for the study of basic  processes in
              cell- and neurobiology.  This mission is augmented  by a teaching program that
              provides practical research training  using marine organisms to investigators
              at all career levels from  established scientists to high school students. 
              Because of the  cell biological emphasis of research at the Whitney Laboratory,
               we rely heavily on the techniques of anatomy, biophysics, and  biochemistry
              and, most recently, molecular genetics.  The  expertise and specific research
              interests of the faculty at the  Whitney Laboratory are diverse, but all of our
              work falls within  the common themes of cell signalling and molecular
              evolution.    Central to the research efforts of all groups at the Laboratory 
              is our molecular genetics core facility that was established in  1989.  The
              current and growing importance of the tools of  molecular genetics and modern
              protein chemistry in the research  effots of the Whitney Laboratory has
              produced a critical need for  an image analysis system that will permit us to
              efficiently  analyze the results of biochemical and molecular biological 
              experiments.  For this reason we are requesting funds to purchase  an
              electriphoresis analyzer system that will be centrally located  in the
              Laboratory so it can be used conveniently by all research  groups.  This system
              is essential to the continued success of  many of our NSF-funded research
              programs.  Without it, many of  our on-going projects will be slowed
              significantly, and other  critical projects simply will not get off the ground.
