Abstract    :
              9318096  Brown   This study will investigate spatial variation in the abundance
              of a species over its geographic range. Most of the research will involve
              analysis of data from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), standardized censuses of
              hundreds of species of breeding birds at approximately 2000 local sites in
              North America, some of which have been conducted annually for 25 years.
              Statistical analysis of these data using a Geographic Information System (GIS)
              and other methods will quantify: 1) the frequency distribution of abundace
              among sites where a species occurs, 2) spatial patterns of variation in
              abundance, especially with respect with distance from the center and boundaries
              of the range, and 3) temporal variation in the spatial distribution of
              abundance, including shifts in range boundaries. These analyses will enable the
              investigators to distinguish among hypotheses to explain the observed patterns,
              including both null hypotheses of random variation and alternative hypotheses
              based on the mechanistic ecological processes that affect local abundance. The
              empirical patterns will also be compared to patterns predicted by computer
              simulation models of multidimensional niches.   %%%  Results of this research
              will contribute to the unification of ecology and biogeography by addressing
              basic questions about the relationship between local abundance and geographic
              distribution. The results will also enhance our ability to understand, and
              therefore ultimately predict, changes in the geographic distributions and local
              abundances of species that are occurring in response to human activities.  ***
