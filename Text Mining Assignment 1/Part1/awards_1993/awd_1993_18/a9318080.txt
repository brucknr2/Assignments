Abstract    :
              9318080  Morris  Tufts University School of Medicine is part of the Tufts Health
               Sciences Campus which is a confederation of separately administered 
              institutions with cooperative arrangements to fulfill shared  missions of
              patient care, education and research.  These  institutions include Tufts
              University's four health-science schools  and the USDA Human Nutrition Research
              Center on Aging; the New  England Medical Center and 30 affiliated clinical
              teaching sites  throughout New England.  Tufts University School of Medicine
              proposes to provide Internet  linkage to 2100 faculty located in over 30
              affiliated hospitals  throughout New England either by direct dedicated 56 KBS
              line for  those hospitals with or planning to have a hospital backbone or by 
              dial-in service to physicians for whom direct connection is not  possible. 
              This Internet connection will impact patient care,  education, research and
              facilitate administrative matters.  Specific benefits to be derived from this
              grant will be to improve  the following; communication between 3300 Tufts
              faculty;  collaboration on multi-center research projects; medical education 
              for its students at remote sites; potential for remote  consultation; access to
              factual and bibliographic database,  including access to Medline, available at
              Tufts through the Tufts  Healthnet and through the Internet; and access to
              referred  patients' clinical data.  The grant's objectives are to link three
              hospitals with network  backbones by dedicated 56 KBS datalines directly to the
              Internet  and to provide dial-in service for physicians at hospitals not 
              directly connected to a backbone.  In addition, to further the  objectives of
              Tufts University School of Medicine Robert Wood  Johnson Foundation planning
              grant, access will be provided to  physicians who become part of the Community
              Physician Educator  Program whose goal is to increase the number of generalist 
              physicians.
