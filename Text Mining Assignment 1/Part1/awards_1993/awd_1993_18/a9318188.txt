Abstract    :
              To contribute to the knowledge on uncommon and rare insect herbivores, which are
              poorly understood, eight species of sawflies will be studies in a landscape
              defined by the watershed of Rio de Flag, Arizona. These sawflies are
              particularly valuable subjects for study because they all leave characteristic
              damage which can be found and recorded, and even cryptic species can be
              discovered by their damage. The distribution and abundance of these species in
              space and time will be studied for three years in natural populations on scales
              of the landscape, host plant populations, and host individuals. Experiments
              will examine female sawfly behavior to determine site preference (plant
              species, age, and growth rate) and its impact on larval performance. These
              experiments will provide mechanistic explanation for the distribution and
              abundance of sawflies in the field to the extent that the bottom-up forces
              through plant quality, to female behavior and larval survival, are important.
              Top-down effects from carnivores on the distribution and abundance of sawflies
              will also be examined in natural populations and experiments.   %%%  With the
              understanding gained from this research on uncommon and rare insect herbivores,
              the PI can develop a theory on why species such as these sawflies remain
              uncommon, and ultimately to gain understanding on why some insect herbivore
              species become very abundance and outbreak species that reach the status of
              pests.
