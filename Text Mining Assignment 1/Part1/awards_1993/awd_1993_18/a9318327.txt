Abstract    :
              9318327  Dongarra       This award is a software capitalization award to further
               enhance the distribution of Netlib software over the internet.   Netlib
              software is a collection of numerical analysis software  libraries.  Since the
              initiation of the project in 1987, more than  1.2 million accesses to Netlib
              software have been made with more  than 450,000 in 1993 alone.  The award
              supports the development of  tools to:         1.  Allow transparent access to
              a distributed set of       interoperable software repositories;         2. 
              Allow filtering and customizing of the information base.         3.  Allow fast
              search and retrieval mechanisms.         4.  Allow evaluation of software
              repository performance.         5.  Allow user contributions of software and
              performance data           to be incorporated into the information base.       
               6.  Allow auxiliary databases and services to be made       available.
