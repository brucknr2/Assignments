Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Christy Turner/Diane Hawkey  SBR-9318334    Within the
              past decade the search for the origins of fully modern humans has become
              focussed on Africa and possibly Asia.  While fossil evidence from Indonesia,
              Southeast Asia, and Australia suggest the Asian region as a possible source for
              modern humans, little is known of the relationship between ice-age South Asian
              and other early Asian populations.  Ultimtely, new data concerning possible
              micro-evolution andnpoulatin dynamics at the world local poulation level are
              needed before major issues concerning the models of human origins can be
              satisfactorily addressed.    This dissertation project will assess the
              relationship between prehistoric South Asian peoples and early world
              populations.  An assessment of this particular region is essential since South
              Asia served as an important crossroad, linking the peoples of early mainland
              Southeast Asia to western and southern Eurasia.  To accomplish this, a series
              of 38 dental morphology and three mandibular traits will be recorded and
              described for Late Pleistocene/Holocene skeletal remains on over 1500 skeletons
              from Sri Lanka, southern India, eastern India, northeastern India, and Burma,
              currently housed in museums in the U.S., Great Britain, and Switzerland.    ***
