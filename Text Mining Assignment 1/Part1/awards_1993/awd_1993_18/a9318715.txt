Abstract    :
              9318715  Macdadden   Fossil mammal specimens from Bolivia (about 40 plaster
              jackets) will be prepared, and they, and other Bolivian materials
              (approximately 6,000 specimens), will be made available to the research
              community.  This work will provide much needed material to study the
              InterAmerican Interchange.
