Abstract    :
              9318397  Hardee  This project will involve investigation of magnetohydrodynamic
              flows that are of interest in astrophysical systems.  This project will
              continue the present study of the dynamics of collimated outflows such as those
              observed in many extragalactic radio sources, and will extend the study to the
              dynamics of collimated outflows such as those observed in many extragalactic
              radio sources, and will extend the study to the dynamics of collimated outflows
              in Seyfert Galaxies, and protostellar systems.  The investigation involves
              comparison between analytical analysis of the time dependent
              magnetohydrodynamic fluid equations and linearized time dependent
              magnetohydrodynamic fluid equations, and numerical simulations and numerical
              modeling of collimated outflows.  A major objective of this project is to
              perform fully three dimensional numerical simulations and compare results with
              analytically developed theory.  A second objective is to use the results to
              learn how outflow morphology is influenced by the external environment, by the
              presence of dynamically significant magnetic fields, and by radiative cooling. 
              A third objective is to model the emission from collimated outflows and model
              selected objects.  The objectives can be achieved by performing a combination
              of two dimensional and fully three dimensional fluid and MHD simulations of
              extragalactic light continuum jets, and protostellar and other radiatively
              cooled heavy jets.  The analytical theory is used to establish model dependence
              on parameters and for its predictive abilities. ***
