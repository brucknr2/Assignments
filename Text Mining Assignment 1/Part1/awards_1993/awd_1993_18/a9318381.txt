Abstract    :
              9318381  Eanes   Chromosomal rearrangements are a significant feature of animal
              and plant genomes, and are a significant cause of cancers.  However, to date
              little is known about the features of the breakpoints of such arrangements. 
              Using Drosophila melangaster as a model organism, this project will examine DNA
              sequence features associated with the chromosomal breakpoints of three
              inversions found to be polymorphic in natural populations.  This will also
              examine the one fixed inversion difference between D. melangaster and D.
              simulans.  The proposed investigation will use an established
              microdissection-polymerase chain reaction approach to efficiently recover
              genomic clones spanning breakpoints.  The subsequent analysis of these clones
              and population samples of inverted and standard arrangements will permit
              evaluation of a number of hypotheses of long standing interest.  These include
              determining whether rearrangements are each unique mutational events, and cause
              mutations in genes.  It will also allow us to determine if some inversions are
              old.  Overall, our study will contribute novel information specific to the
              mutational origin, phenotypic consequences, and population genetics of
              inversion polymorphism.  The fruit fly species. Drosophila melangaster, is
              growing rapidly as a model of molecular change particularly with respect to
              variation in single genes.  This study will add a unique and significant
              contribution to our understanding chromosomal rearrangements in general.
