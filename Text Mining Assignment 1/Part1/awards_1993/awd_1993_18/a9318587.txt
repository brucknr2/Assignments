Abstract    :
              9318587  Chase  Sweet Briar College on behalf of the Tri-College Consortium 
              requests support from NSF for connection of their campus networks  to VERnet. 
              The Tri-College Consortium comprises Sweet Briar  College, Randolph-Macon
              Woman's College, and Lynchburg College.   VERnet, the mid-level network
              offering services in Virginia, will  provide operations management and
              information services and it  will give the consortium 3 56 thousand bits per
              second  connections to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits  per
              second) National Backbone network.    Students and faculty research will
              benefit from the link.  By  linking to the mid-level and national networks the
              Tri-College  Consortium's faculty and academics will maintain a position of 
              leadership in research and educational innovation by profiting  from remote
              access to super computer centers, data bases and  information services, high
              speed communications, file transfer  and remote login, and access to library
              resources. This is also a  unique opportunity for the school to explore
              innovative  educational resources.
