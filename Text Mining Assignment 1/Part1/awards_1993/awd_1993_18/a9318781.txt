Abstract    :
              9318781  Sirlin       The proposed research includes a variety of topics in 
              particle physics and quantum field theory.  These include:  (1) studies of
              electroweak physics to  (a) verify the  Standard Model at the level of its
              quantum corrections;  (b)  constrain the masses of the top quark and the Higgs
              boson;  (c) search for deviations that may signal the presence of  new physics;
               (2) work on the critical limit of lattice  gauge theory and non-perturbative
              effects in quantum  chromodynamics, including exploiting the calculational 
              scheme developed recently whereby the lattice Faddeev-Popov  formula is
              modified to take into account the Gribov horizon,  while nevertheless
              maintaining perturbative  renormalizability;  (3) work to (a) determine the 
              constraints imposed on the effective low-energy string  lagrangians by
              supersymmetry and space-time duality; (b)  study examples of exactly solvable
              open strings in nontrival  backgrounds, and their relevance to low-energy
              physics; (c)  find the effective lagrangians for the higher-spin massive 
              states present in string theory.  ***
