Abstract    :
              9318860  McCleary       This project connects Rockhurst College to NSFNET
              through  MIDnet over a 56 kbps line.  Faculty and students will benefit from 
              access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and 
              supercomputers.  In addition, they will be able to communicate and  collaborate
              with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of  research and educational
              projects.  The award provides partial  support of the project for two years.
