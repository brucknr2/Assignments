Abstract    :
              9318180  Ellisman  The increased availability of High Performance Computing and
              Communications (HPCC) offers scientists the potential for effective remote
              interactive use of centralized, specialized, and expensive instrumentation and
              computers.  The goal of this national challenge project is to design and
              implement a collaborative computational environment, or Collaboratory for
              Microscopic Digital Anatomy, providing a researcher at a remote site
              distributed interaction with unique instrumentation for the acquistion and
              manipulation of images of biological structure.  The initial focus will be on
              the development of an integrated system for remote interactive acquistition and
              analysis of 2- and 3- dimensional light and electron microscopic data from
              digital image acquistion systems.  To accomplish this task, a multidisciplinary
              team representing several institutions including the University of California ,
              San Diego, Cornell University and the Center for Computer  Graphics and
              Scientific Visualization, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center, has been
              assembled, including computer scientists specializing in HPCC and volume
              visualization, and biologists with expertise in computer-aided light and
              electron microscopy.  This award will enable these activities.  This project is
              being supported by several programs at NSF:  New Technologies in Computer and
              Information Science, Cell Biology, Computational Neuroscience and Computational
              Biology.
