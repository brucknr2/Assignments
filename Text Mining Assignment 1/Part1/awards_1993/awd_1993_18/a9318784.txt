Abstract    :
                        9318784  Milton       The role of food (and its distribution) as a
              basic determinant of group size and grouping patterns in primates is a much
              discussed topic.  Despite the debate over the causes of sociality, it has been
              widely accepted that the size of a social group is limited by intragroup
              competition over access to feeding sites.  In this regard, the size, abundance
              and dispersion patterns of resource patches on which a species feeds are
              believed to set a limit on the number of animals able to feed as a group due to
              intra group feeding competition.      This project will study the relationship
              of food distribution and group size in an extreme situation - this animal, the
              black uakari monkey, reportedly lives in groups of about 100 in a very remote
              part of Amazonia.  It will undoubtedly result in very interesting findings,
              especially as the species has never been studied before, and is considered
              endangered.    The project will result in expert training of a new scientist.
