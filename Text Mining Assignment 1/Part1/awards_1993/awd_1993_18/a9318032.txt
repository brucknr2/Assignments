Abstract    :
              9318032  Wing  The overall objective of this proposal is to acquire  instrument
              resources for a high throughput automated system  for plant and animal genome
              analysis.  This enabling  technology will be used for genetic map construction,
               diversity analysis, pedigree construction, analysis of  complex traits,
              map-based gene cloning and genome database  development.  The requested system
              will support the  multidisciplinary research of seven major user research 
              groups and 8 additional research laboratories.    The instrument resources
              required for the automated system  include; a large capacity freeze dryer for
              sample  preparation and storage, a fluorimeter which can be used in  a 96 well
              format with output connected via computer for  automated sample dilution, a
              robot for automated liquid  handing and photometric measurement tasks,
              dedicated PCR  instruments for amplification of DNA markers, an automated  DNA
              sequencer for analysis of amplified polymorphic DNA and  for acquisition of
              microsatellite, cDNA and other marker  sequences, a gel image for data capture
              and storage, and a  UNIX Workstation for data analysis and genome informatics. 
                The instrument resources will be housed in the 2,500 square  foot Laboratory
              for Crop Genome Analysis which is located in  a new Crop Biotechnology Center
              at Texas A&M University.  The Crop Biotechnology Center will provide for the 
              maintenance and operation of the instrument resource.  The  principal
              investigator, Dr. Rod Wing, will oversee the  operation of the automated genome
              analysis system.  Day-to-  day operation and scheduling of the genome analysis
              system  will be carried out by a staff scientist provided through  the Crop
              Biotechnology Center.
