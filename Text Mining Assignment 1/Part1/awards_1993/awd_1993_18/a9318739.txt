Abstract    :
              9318739  Jain  Theoretical research will be done on the Fractional Quantum Hall 
              Effect.  The basis for this work is the composite fermion model  proposed by
              the principal investigator a few years ago.  This model  has recently been
              shown to explain well the Hall state at half-  filling.  In this renewal grant,
              the composite fermion model will  be further developed and applied to other
              aspects of the Fractional  Quantum Hall Effect with a particular emphasis on
              quantitative  agreement with experiment.  %%%  The quantum Hall state
              represents an exciting new state of matter  which has occupied researchers
              attention since its discovery a  decade ago.  This state of matter is one in
              which the electrons  interact very strongly and the usual techniques of
              condensed matter  physics fail.  The work to be done here deals with a model
              which  connects two different aspects of the Hall state under a common 
              theoretical formalism.  This work addresses very fundamental issues  in
              condensed matter physics and, at the same time, provides an  understanding
              which may impact the behavior of semiconductor  devices.  ***
