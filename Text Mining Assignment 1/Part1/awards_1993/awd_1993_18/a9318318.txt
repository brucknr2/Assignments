Abstract    :
              9318318  Church           Pilot experiments will be performed that will lead the
              way  toward developing polonium and its species as an important marine  tracer.
               These experiments include:    (1) defining the volatile species of polonium in
              laboratory  cultures, such as those that are prolific sulfur gas producers, 
              focusing on potential alkylated species, and     (2) describing polonium
              distribution and speciation in productive  coastal (salt marshes), (shelf
              break), and open (for North  Atlantic) surface waters, where it is known to be
              seasonally in  excess, and fractionated in biological systems and resulting 
              sedimentary organic material.         These experiments will build on existing
              evidence gathered  under a previous NSF sulfur grant.  The significance of the 
              experiments should lead the way to future development of polonium  as a
              powerful tracer of carbon cycles in the upper ocean, air-sea  exchange of
              carbon and sulfur based biogases, and carbon fluxes  to underlying sediments.
