Abstract    :
              9318821  Clark  This Conference will highlight  scientific as well as
              engineering  aspects of enzyme technology.  The  program will include sessions 
              devoted to new biocatalysts,  advances in biosensor technology,  metabolic and
              protein engineering,  metal-based biocatalysts, and new  biomolecules with
              enzyme-like  properties.  Industrial applications  are also to be presented.
