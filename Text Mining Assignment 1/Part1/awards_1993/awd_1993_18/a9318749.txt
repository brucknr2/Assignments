Abstract    :
              9318749  Goldman    Technical abstract:  Two-dimensional electron states (2DES)
              in  semiconductor microstructures exhibit unique properties associated  with
              strongly correlated electrons.  Such properties include one-  dimensional edge
              states, Wigner crystallization, and single-charge  carrier tunneling.  The
              properties of the collective ground states  of 2DES and size-quantized systems
              of few electrons, their  excitations, edge states, and the quantum phase
              transitions will be  studied experimenrally at very low temperatures and very
              high  magnetic fields via magnetotransport, thermal activation, nonlinear 
              transport, as well as by resonant and single particle tunneling  experiments.  
               Non-technical abstract:  Ultra-thin layers of semiconductors can  have
              significant potential applications in future high performance  semiconductor
              devices.  Such materials systems also allow the  investigation of unique
              electronic phenomena which are particularly  strikingly exhibited at very low
              temperatures close to absolute  zero and in very high magnetic fields.  The
              "quantum Hall effect"  is one of the remarkable phenomena which exhibits highly
              unusual  phenomena such as fractional electronic charge and highly ordered 
              assemblies of electrons.  The proposed experiments are designed to  understand
              the broad theoretical concepts that underlie thses  unique properties.  In
              another experiment the transport of single  electrons will be studied in
              specially designed ultrasmall  semiconductor dots which are initially
              unoccupied by electrons.   The approach is to measure the changes in electronic
              current as  electrons are sequentially transferred into such a quantum dot.  
              This process will be extended to ultralow temperatures and high  magnetic
              fields and compared with recent theoretical predictions.  ***
