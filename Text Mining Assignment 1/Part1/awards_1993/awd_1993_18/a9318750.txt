Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. John Fleagle/Pierre Lemelin  SBR- 9318750    The
              evolution of prehensile extremities is a recurrent theme in models of primate
              origins.  However, there is strong disagreement about the underlying causes
              associated with the shift toward greater prehensile capabilities of the hand in
              primates.  Proponents of the arboreal theory of primate origins have suggested
              that locomotion in the trees, especially leaping from branch to branch, was the
              primary selective factor involved in the evolution of prehensile hands and
              other primate diagnostic features.  Alternative models stressing viual
              predation on invertebrates on fine-branch supports have also been proposed to
              explain the emergence of these features.  The main problem when evaluating
              these models is that no detailed knowledge exists on how performance variables
              actually relate to hand function and structure in extant primates.    To this
              end, this research project will document associations between hand morphology
              and hand use during locomotion, posture, and manipulation of food objects
              whithin extant prosimian primates.  Differences in hand proportions and
              musculature will be contrasted with behavioral observataions on hand use for
              selected genera.  Comparisons will then be made with some non-primate groups in
              order to highlight the peculiarly primate specializations of prehensility. 
              This study will provide  an empirical basis to evaluate various models of
              primate origins to explain manual prehensility, and to interpert behavior in
              many important fossil hands.  ***  P\anthro\jfried\9318750.abs
