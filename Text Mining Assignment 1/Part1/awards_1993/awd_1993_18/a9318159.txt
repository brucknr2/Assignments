Abstract    :
              9318159  Schulten  Project Summary  High performance computers, in particular
              massively parallel  computers, and the emergent, high-capacity research network
               will be employed to advance modelling and structure  determination
              calculations in molecular biology and  pharmacology. To this end, seven
              investigators with  expertise in computer science, applied mathematics, 
              molecular biology, pharmacology, chemistry, and physics will  combine their
              efforts towards four goals: (i) to develop  prototype molecular dynamics
              algorithms for very large, very  long, and very accurate   applications as well
              as to enhance  the efficiency of such algorithms; (ii) to transfer the  above
              algorithms to a widely used molecular dynamics program  for structural biology
              (X-PLOR) and to develop, within the  framework of this program, efficient
              algorithms for  computational crystallography and solution NMR spectroscopy; 
              (iii) to use the computational test beds of NSF centers and  to apply the
              programs developed to grand challenge problems  in molecular biology and
              pharmacology, initially for  structure determination and interactive molecular
              dynamics  of membrane-protein-water systems, of membrane transport of  drugs,
              of DNA-protein-water systems and, later, for large  supramolecular systems like
              the coat of poliovirus or actin-  myosin strands in muscle fiber; (iv) to
              develop a graphic  user interface which allows convenient interactive molecular
               modelling between local graphics workstations and remote  massively parallel
              computers at NSF centers, to pioneer the  routine use of teleconference
              communication between the  investigators through use of the National Research
              Network  in its various stages of completion, and to institute a  "teleacademy
              for computational biology" as a regular seminar  on the video conference
              facilities of the NSF centers and  other qualified sites.
