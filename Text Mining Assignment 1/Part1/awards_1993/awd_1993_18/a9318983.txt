Abstract    :
                     9318983  This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist 
              at a predominantly undergraduate institution, Cal State Long  Beach.  The
              researcher will study of immigrant Maya Indians from  Mexico have changed their
              conceptions and expectations of aged  people as a result of their experiences
              in the U.S.  Using  technical quantitative sorting analyses of terms denoting
              aging,  the anthropologist will describe the cognitive models of aging of  a
              sample of Mayans.  This analysis will then be combined with  more traditional
              interviewing and observational data to provide a  description and analysis of
              the condition of aging among this  immigrant community.     This research is
              important because as both the aged and  immigrants become a larger proportion
              of U.S. society, the need  becomes greater to increase understanding of their
              condition.  These understandings will be valuable to planners in any  community
              where immigrants form a distinct population.  ***
