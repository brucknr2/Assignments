Abstract    :
              9318068   Lemmon  The aim of this grant proposal is to obtain a Confocal
              Microscope Imaging System for a group of neuroscientists who use light
              microscopic techniques as our principal methods of data analysis. Over the past
              few years confocal microscopy has been used in striking ways to localize
              subcellular structures and to image growing cells in complex tissues, providing
              new insights into cell cell interactions. The investigators in this user group
              are interested in the formation of the complex 3 dimensional organization of
              the nervous system. Four of the users examine axons, growth cones or synapses
              in living tissues. The fifth user studies the formation of the blood brain
              barrier and how glia participate in this. The acquisition of a confocal
              microscope would greatly enhance the capabilities of the members of this group.
              Not only would we increase the resolution of the data we obtain, we would be
              able to address questions that are presently unapproachable due to the inherent
              limitations of our current imaging facilities.    Confocal microscopy
              eliminates stray light from the image focal plane. This dramatically increases
              the resolution compared with conventional epifluorescence microscopic
              techniques. This permits optical sectioning of a fairly thick biological
              specimen. When coupled with a computer/image analysis system, data from a
              series of optical sections can be assembled to form a 3 dimensional
              reconstruction of the fluorescent emission pattern from the specimen.
              Subcellular structures can be localized within or on a cell using antibodies or
              other fluorescent probes, even in a complex environment such as a t issue slice
              or an intact embryo or animal. For most of the user group, this technique will
              be applied to make time lapse movies of live cells in tissues or whole animals.
              Recently confocal microscopy has been adapted to the technique of interference
              reflection microscopy (IRM), permitting much larger areas of a specimen to be
              examined at lower illumination levels. This greatly facilitates time lapse
              video of IRM of live cells. It is the confocal microscope's ability to produce
              high resolution, time lapse images of dynamically changing structures, such as
              developing or aging nervous tissue, that is our major technical requirement at
              this time.    List of Participants    Principle Investigator  Vance Lemmon,
