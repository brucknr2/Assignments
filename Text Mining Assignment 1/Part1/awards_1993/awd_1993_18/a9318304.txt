Abstract    :
              9318304  Badgley  This research is a continuation of a study of the influence of
              climate on the ecological structure of mammal communities as represented by
              size and trophic structure. Using existing data, this study will encompass
              analyses of mammal faunas on five continents. The primary research questions
              include evaluating the correlation among size, trophic specialization, and
              phylogenetic affiliation among continental faunas and among assemblages from
              different continents. The study will document the response of mammal
              assemblages to changing climatic conditions. Also, phylogenetic constraints
              will be incorporated into an understanding of size and trophic structure of
              different faunal assemblages.   %%%  The proposed research represents the first
              detailed analysis of relationships between climatic conditions and ecological
              structure of mammal assemblages on a continental and global scale. Results from
              this research will lead to a clearer understanding of the role of climate in
              shaping ecological communities, and to a predictive model for mammalian faunal
              change under scenarios of future climate change.  ***
