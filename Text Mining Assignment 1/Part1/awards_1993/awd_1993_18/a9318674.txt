Abstract    :
              9318674  Gaffey    Investigations of Asteroid Families and Shapes.    Most
              asteroids are fragments of collisionally disrupted planetesimals, and many 
              asteroid families are such disrupted bodies in an early stage of dispersal.  
              Investigations of individual parent body fragments and of asteroid families 
              provide information on the early inner Solar System transient thermal events 
              which heated their parent bodies, the internal structures of their parent 
              planetesimals resulting from planetary differentiation, and the large scale 
              collisions which fragmented them.  Dr. Gaffey will conduct observations to 
              investigate asteroid shapes and asteroid families.  Mineralogic compositions of
               asteroid family members will be determined from spectra to test the genetic 
              models of asteroid families, to identify interlopers within families, to test
              the  reality of proposed families with small memberships, to constrain the
              lifetimes  of asteroid families, and to evaluate the internal structure of the
              parent  planetesimals of interesting and important families.
