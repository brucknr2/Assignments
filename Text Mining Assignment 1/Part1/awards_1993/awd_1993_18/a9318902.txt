Abstract    :
              9318902  Knopper     This project is investigating and developing tools for
              management  and distribution of inter-domain policy-based routing information 
              for the Internet.  The award provides for equipment and personnel  for the
              routing experiments, including a subcontract to Cornell for  GateD
              modifications and testing.  Maximum duration of the award is  24 months.
