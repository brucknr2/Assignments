Abstract    :
              Abstract  Woman Hospital - R. Roy   WHNET Connection to Internet   Proposal No.
              NCR-9318038  Woman Hospital requests support from NSF for connection of its 
              WHNET to Internet. The proposed project results in benefits in  four specific
              areas: research, patient care, continuing  education, and medical library. 
              Access to the Internet will be  available to all professional staff, residents,
              and nursing  students at Woman's Hospital.    Following the installation of the
              necessary hardware and the  establishment of a 56 kbps leased line, Performance
              Systems  International will serve as the regional service provider to the 
              Internet.  Additionally, key project staff from the Information  Systems
              Division and from the Medical Library will receive  specialized training on
              Internet and develop training modules  appropriate for users at the hospital.
