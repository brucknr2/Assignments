Abstract    :
              9318581  Bashkin  Washington Univ - St. Louis  Dr. James K. Bashkin, Chemistry
              Department, Washington University, is supported in the  Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, for investigations of the
              metal-catalyzed hydrolytic cleavage of RNA. To probe the mechanisms of these
              reactions, RNA hydrolysis and cleavage will be  studied using metal complexes
              with known coordination geometries. Possible modes of action, including Lewis
              acid catalysis, nucleophilic or base catalysis, and inner- and outer-sphere
              metal-substrate interactions, will be probed. The mechanistic information will
              be further utilized to design a series of synthetic ribozymes which will mimic
              the ability of natural ribozymes to cleave specific RNA sequences. In order to
              obtain rapid kinetic data, several new RNA cleavage assays will be developed.  
               The construction and breakdown of the genetic code in DNA and RNA involves
              chemical processes that are of fundamental importance to living cells, yet many
              aspects of these processes are poorly understood. The goal of this research is
              to determine the chemistry by which DNA and RNA codes are disassembled. These
              chemical discoveries may be applied to the destruction of undesirable genetic
              codes which arise from mutation or infection.
