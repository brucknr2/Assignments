Abstract    :
              9318255  McBride  Recently, a pressure-clamp technique has been developed (1)
              which is used in conjunction with patch-clamp techniques to study the kinetic
              properties of single and whole-cell mechanosensitive (MS) channel currents. 
              The pressure-clamp technique is based on the balancing of negative and positive
              pressures to achieve the desired pressure at the membrane patch.  Apart from
              its use in the activation of MS channel currents it can also provide a
              convenient means of applying defined and reproducible pressure/suction
              protocols for tight seal formation necessary in all patch-clamp experiments. 
              The main goals of this project are to improved the existing prototype and make
              it into a convenient unit accessible to researchers studying MS channels as
              well as to patch-clampers in general. The main improvements center around
              efforts to reduce the response time of the clamp from its present value of 10
              ms to the sub-millisecond time range.  Another related improvement involves
              miniaturization of the system which will make the clamp a more compact and 
              convenient package.    Another aspect of the proposal involves determining the
              dynamics of membrane movement during the application of rapid pressure/suction
              steps. For instance, does membrane movement precede or is it even necessary for
              MS channel activation?  This will be addressed by high resolution (both
              temporal and spatial) video microscopy. We will simultaneously monitor the
              pressure, voltage, current, membrane capacitance and membrane movement during
              the pressure/suction step.   y, a pressure-clamp technique has been developed
