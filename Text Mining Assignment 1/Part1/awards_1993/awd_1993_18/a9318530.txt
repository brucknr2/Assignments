Abstract    :
              This component of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Land/Atmosphere/Ice
              Interactions (LAII) Flux Study research will (1) develop Geographic Information
              System (GIS) databases at five scales (1:10, 1:500, 1:5000, 1:25,000, and
              1:250,000) and at five sites; (2) develop an understanding of the relationship
              between vegetation signals and key terrain parameters; and (3) develop a method
              to use remotely-sensed images and GIS variables to distinguish key vegetation
              parameters for spatial models of trace-gas fluxes.  One task will be the
              development of methane and CO2 flux maps at multiple scales of the Toolik
              Lake-Imnavait Creek region, using; (1) an empirical approach based on field
              measurements of trace-gas fluxes in a hierarchy of vegetation types, and (2) a
              modeled approach using a variety of remotely sensed satellite data. 
              Measurements of vegetation, biomass, soil, site, and spectral reflectance
              characteristics will be made at permanent study plots representing the majority
              of landscape variation.  Trace-gas measurements by other investigators at the
              same sites and GIS databases will be used to extrapolate this information to
              landscape and regional scales.  Permanently marked 1 x 1 km grids at the five
              study areas will be used as a sampling framework for much of this research
              (e.g. monitoring trends in species composition and canopy structure in relation
              to landscape variables and climate change) and other research within the
              project. Data from GIS databases will also be used by other investigators in
              hydrology models, terrain models of trace-gas fluxes, and algorithms to scale
              plot-level measurements to regional scales.
