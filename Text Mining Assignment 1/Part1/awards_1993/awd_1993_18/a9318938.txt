Abstract    :
              9318938  Engelhardt  This award is for support of a one year project to measure,
              with  high accuracy and wide areal coverage, the velocity field of  Rutford Ice
              Stream and Pine Island Glacier, using the new technique  of satellite radar
              interferometry.  The Rutford Ice Stream and Pine  Island Glacier are both major
              outlet glaciers for the West Ant-  arctic Ice Sheet.  The former flows directly
              into the Ronne Ice  Shelf while the latter enters the ocean directly.  A
              comparative  study of their behavior will contribute to an understanding of the
               mass balance and stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and its  role in
              global climatic change.  ***
