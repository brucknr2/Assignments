Abstract    :
              9318701  Kintigh    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Keith Kintigh
              will  analyze museum collections and associated documentation located  in
              institutions in New York city, Boston and Cambridge England..  These data will
              be integrated with materials in hand and  published in a monograph which traces
              changes in Zuni Native  American settlement pattern and social organization
              between ca.  1240 and 1540 AD. In the late 19th and early 20th century major 
              archaeological excavations were conducted at three prehistoric  Zuni towns:
              Heshotauthla, Halona and Kechipawan. Work proceeded  at a scale which would be
              impossible today and at all sites large  areas were exposed. While extensive
              field notes were taken, at  none of the sites were the materials fully analyzed
              and published  and Dr. Kintigh wishes to examine these data and incorporate
              them  into his own broad scale analysis of Zuni prehistory.         The Zuni
              case is particularly significant because the area  is one of the very few in
              the United States where a fertile  archaeological record documents 1000 years
              of cultural continuity  with a modern group having a strong traditional culture
              and rich  ethnographic record. The 1240-1540 AD period marks a particularly 
              important interval because during this time Zuni first aggregated  into a few
              large settlements, then relocated into a larger number  of planned towns and
              then finally established the villages which  were occupied when Spanish entered
              the region. Thus this record  allows one to trace the development of complex
              society and the  subsequent social shifts which accompanied the change to
              smaller  settlements. The result will contribute to understanding of the 
              underlying processes involved in population aggregation and  increasing
              organizational complexity.         This research is important for several
              reasons. It will  provide data of interest to many regional archaeologists. It
              will  also shed new light on the effects of European invasion on Native 
              American peoples. Because la te prehistoric social and political  changes
              throughout the U.S. Southwest appear to be inter-related,  a refined
              understanding of the Zuni situation will benefit  broader archaeological
              inquiries.   ***
