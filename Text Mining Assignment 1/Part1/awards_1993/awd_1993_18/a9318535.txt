Abstract    :
              OPP-9318535  Kane  Development of climatic models has intensely highlighted the
              fact that almost all of the important processes controlling climate are
              interactive and that it is vital to understand the linkages between these
              processes; for example, what is the role of the hydrologic system in connecting
              atmospheric and terrestrial processes.  As a component of the ARCSS LAII Flux
              study, the objective of this project is to improve the understanding of the
              linkages between atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic systems; specifically,
              this means developing a quantitative understanding of the energy and mass
              transfer processes of the hydrologic regime.  A primary component of this study
              is a field measurement program to quantify the water balance of watersheds that
              are physically quite different (for example, watersheds in the Foothills
              compared to those on the Coastal Plain) and an energy balance of the entire
              region from the Arctic Ocean to the Brooks Range.  One goal is to develop a
              physically based, spatially distributed hydrologic model that, when combined
              with the results of cooperating LAII researchers, can be coupled with the
              biogeochemical processes of a watershed.  Other goals are to develop an
              understanding of the mechanisms which impact snow distribution and a working
              model of lateral and vertical fluxes of water and energy in the entire Kuparuk
              watershed.  ***
