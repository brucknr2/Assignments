Abstract    :
              9318597  Thorndike       This group of a senior faculty member and two post
              doctoral  associates participates in research on b quark properties with  the
              CLEO group at the CESR electron-positron collider facility.  CESR provides
              record numbers of B's whose partial decay rates to  rare and exotic states will
              be determined.  The program is one of  the most important in particle physics. 
              It provides tests of,  and is a means to search for deviations from, the
              standard model  as applied to heavy quarks.  ***
