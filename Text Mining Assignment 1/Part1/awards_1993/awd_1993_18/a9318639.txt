Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the  
              Chemistry Division, W. Carl Lineberger will study the structure and   dynamics
              of molecular ions, both isolated and aggregated with known   numbers of solvent
              molecules, with emphasis on three-carbon hydrocarbons   and transition metal
              aggregates.   Bond strengths of fundamental   hydrocarbon radicals will be
              obtained, rearrangements and transition   states for transient intermediates
              will be investigated, and quantitative   information on the electronic
              structure of small metal clusters will be   obtained.  Ultrafast laser
              technologies will be developed to obtain   real-time dynamic information on
              reactive processes in ions with   partially completed solvent shells.  This
              research will utilize two   ultrafast lasers to initiate and probe chemical
              reactions in a   microsolvent.    One goal of these studies is to increase the
              quantitative understanding   of the processes driving the simplest chemical
              transformations.  By   studying the chemical transformations of molecules which
              are both   isolated as well as surrounded by solvent species, Lineberger will
              be   able to demonstrate the effect that different solvents have on reactivity 
               as well as on the rates at which these reactions proceed.
