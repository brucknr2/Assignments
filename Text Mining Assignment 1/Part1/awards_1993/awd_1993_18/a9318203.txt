Abstract    :
              9318203  Stetson         Research comparing the importance of the pituitary
              hormone  prolactin (PRL) in reproduction and pledge development in golden 
              hamsters, Siberian hamsters and collard lemmings will be  initiated in the year
              covered by this award. These species show  dramatically different physiological
              changes in reproduction and  pelage development on a seasonal basis. While
              Siberian hamsters  and lemmings molt to a white pelage during the winter (short
              day  response), golden hamsters do not. While both hamster species are 
              inhibited reproductively by short days, lemmings continue to  breed vigorously,
              despite the winter morphology induced by  these environmental conditions. In
              all three species, serum PRL  levels are high under long days and low under
              short days. Since  PRL influences both reproductive status and pelage 
              characteristics, we hypothesize that the importance of PRL in  these processes
              will differ in our 3 experimental species. Such  differences may indicate
              specific adaptive divergences in the  function of PRL; a divergence driven by
              the evolution of species  in environments with dramatically differing selective
              pressures.  ***
