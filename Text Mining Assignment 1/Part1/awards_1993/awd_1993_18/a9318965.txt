Abstract    :
              9318965  Keita       ABSTRACT    A conference on Psychosocial and Behavioral
              Factors in Women's Health , sponsored by the American Psychological Association
              and involving 350 - 500 participants, will be held in Washington, D.C., May
              12-14, 1994.  Participants will include health researchers, basic scientists,
              federal agency personnel, legislators, health care providers, educators, and
              the media. This conference has three objectives: 1) To critically review
              current research and theory on psychosocial and behavioral factors in women's
              health; 2) to evaluate implications of psychosocial research for disease
              prevention and health promotion across the life span of women; 3) to translate
              research on psychosocial and behavioral issues into community-based initiatives
              and interventions promoting women's health. Keynote addresses, panel
              discussions, and poster sessions will focus on: a) theoretical
              models/frameworks for conceptualizing women's health; b) issues in research
              methodology, measurement, and evaluation; c) new research on psychosocial and
              behavioral factors in women's health; d) implications of psychological factors
              in treatment, health policy, interventions; and e) special issues of
              underserved populations
