Abstract    :
              9318121  Anandakrishnan  This award is for support for a three year project to
              test the  hypothesis that a controlling parameter of fast ice-stream flow is 
              the hydrologic state of discrete zones of high friction ("sticky  spots") at
              the bed of the ice streams.  Previous work has  discovered an enormous
              difference in basal microearthquake activity  between fast-flowing ice stream B
              and ice stream C, which stopped  flowing within the last 200 years.  It is
              hypothesized that the  basal water system is lubricating the sticky spots under
              the fast  ice stream and thus inhibiting microearthquake activity, and at the 
              same time permitting fast ice flow.  This experiment is intended to  collect a
              continuous record of wide-bandwidth microearthquake data  from a variety of
              sites, on the ice streams, in the transition  zone, and on the inland ice.  ***
