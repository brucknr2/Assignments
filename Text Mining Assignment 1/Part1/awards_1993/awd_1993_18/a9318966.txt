Abstract    :
              9318966  Wickens       This award will support an annual meeting of researchers 
              studying the processing of RNA molecules.  The post transcriptional 
              modification of RNAs by a variety of mechanisms including splicing, 
              polyadenylation, base modification, nuclease trimming, and editing  is crucial
              to their biological activities.  The meeting has been  held annually for over
              10 years and has played a key role in  stimulating research in this broad,
              important field.    %%%  The biosynthesis of RNA from DNA is the first step in
              utilizing  genetic information.  The RNA is almost always modified in one or 
              more ways before the cell can actually use these molecules for the  many
              functions which they serve.  This award supports a conference  of researchers
              who study the modifications of RNA molecules which  transform them into key
              components of the cellular machinery.  ***
