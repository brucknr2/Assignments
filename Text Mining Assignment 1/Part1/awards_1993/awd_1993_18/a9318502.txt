Abstract    :
              9318502  Griffiths  Simulation models are now being used to predict how global
              climate change might affect vegetation and to determine how different 
              landscape management  approaches may influence that change.  An important
              component of these models is the rate of carbon dioxide released from
              decomposing substrates.  Thus an important parameter is the estimated litter
              decomposition rates.  The assumptions upon which these rates are currently
              calculated may not be valid.  It is generally assumed that litter lignin
              concentration plays an important role in regulating initial decomposition
              rates.  In our view, it is more likely that Reactive PolyPhenols (RPP) such as
              tannin may be important initial regulators of decomposition rates because of
              their ability to bind with nitrogen and phosphorus and because of their ability
              to affect the activity of decomposing organisms.  To obtain better
              understanding of how RPPs regulate litter decomposition rates we are proposing
              to:  (1) develop reliable lignin and litter RPPs analyses, (2) assess the
              extent to which RPPs form complexes with nitrogen in litter, and (3) determine
              the influence of RPP complexes on decomposition and nutrient cycling.
