Abstract    :
              9318496  Mason    The goal of this research is to enable robotic manipulators 
              to make better use of dynamic phenomena.  At present, most  practical robotic
              manipulation is dominated by a kinematic  approach.  Typically an object is
              rigidly grasped by or  affixed to the end effector, and the manipulator is
              moved  along a specified trajectory without explicitly involving  analysis of
              the dynamics of the system.  A dynamic approach  to manipulation extends an
              arm's capabilities in several  ways.  The use of motions tuned to the dynamics
              increases  the speed and maximum load.  The ability to achieve object  motions
              within the hand effectively increases the motion  freedoms of the system. 
              Dynamic methods can have a broad  impact on robotic manipulation, with
              particular applications  in manufacturing and space construction.     The
              approach of this research is to explore task domains in  which impact,
              momentum, and dynamic forces are dominant  effects, such as in catching and
              throwing of objects.  While  these operations were chosen to present
              significant  challenges to manipulation, more than for any immediate  practical
              value, the ability to throw or drop objects may in  some cases extend the
              effective workspace of the  manipulator.  This exploration will involve
              construction of  simple manipulators, development of methods to analyze 
              dynamic manipulation tasks, and production of control and  planning systems. 
              What is learned here will provide  important new knowledge and approaches to
              dynamics of  manipulation applicable to many problem domains.
