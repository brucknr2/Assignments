Abstract    :
               9318631  Zahalak  The research proposed in this application concerns a 
              quantitative understanding of the dynamics of skeletal  muscle.  The project
              has two major objectives: (1) to  continue the development of a model of muscle
              firmly based  on biophysics and biochemistry, and (2) to test and validate  the
              model in carefully controlled animal experiments.  The  model is a mathematical
              approximation to A.F. Huxley's  biophysical cross-bridge theory of contraction.
               Current  models for a most important element of the neuromuscular  control
              system-its actuator, skeletal muscle-have tended to  be rather crude
              viscoelastic analogies with only the most  tenuous connection to modern
              biological concepts about how  the muscle works.  A state-variable model of a
              skeletal  muscle fiber as a direct mathematical approximation to  biophysical
              cross-bridge models of the type introduced by  A.F. Huxley will continue to be
              developed in this project.  This model is call the Distributed-Moment Model of
              muscle  because it emphasizes the important role of the moments of  the
              actin-myosin bond-distribution function.  These moments  have macroscopic
              interpretations as muscle stiffness, force,  and elastic energy.  Thus it is of
              particular significance  that this model establishes a direct connection
              between the  macroscopic behavior of muscle and contractile mechanisms 
              believed to be operating at the molecular level.  The  project is a joint
              effort with Heckman at Northwestern  University (grant number 9419528).  ***
