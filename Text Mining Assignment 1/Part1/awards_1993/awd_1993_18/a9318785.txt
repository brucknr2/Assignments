Abstract    :
              9318785  Timbie    Funding is provided for the development of a new type of  
              millimeter-wave detector, the hot-electron microbolometer.  The  device, based
              upon the temperature dependence of the I-V  characteristic of a superconducting
              tunnel junction, was first  demonstrated by a group at the Boulder laboratory
              of the National  Institute of Standards and Technology.  The same group will 
              fabricate the devices for this project.  Receivers to be used in  the
              measurement of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy will  be constructed
              from the hot-electron microbolometers developed  under this project.  ***
