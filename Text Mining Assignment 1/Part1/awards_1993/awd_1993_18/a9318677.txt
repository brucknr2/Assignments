Abstract    :
              9318677  Alley  This award is for support of research to use geophysical data, 
              glacial-geological data, and theory to develop and parameterize  basal
              formulations for fast ice stream flow, and to test these  parameterizations
              against the data using various ice sheet models.   The result should be the
              development of better models of ice-sheet  flow, which will have the capability
              for better predicting the  future of the West Antarctic ice sheet.  This
              research will attempt  to reduce uncertainties in knowledge of the likelihood
              of ice-sheet  collapse and sea-level rise.  ***
