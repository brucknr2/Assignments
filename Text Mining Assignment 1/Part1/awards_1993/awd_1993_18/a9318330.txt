              ABSTRACT -- CTS 9318330  Sichel    This is a request for an international travel
              grant to cover airfare to attend The 14th International Colloquium on the
              Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems (ICDERS) to be held 1-6 August
              1993, at the University of Coimbra, in Coimbra, Portugal.  The topics covered
              at this conference deal with combustion, explosions detonations, and reactive
              systems.  The PI plans to present the following papers:     "Mechanisms of
              Detonation Transmission in Layered H2 - O2 Mixtures",  N.A. Tonello, M. Sichel,
              and C.W. Kauffman.     "Deflagration to Detonation Transitions Fueled by Dust
              Layers", Y.C. Li,  A.S. Harbaugh, C.G. Alexander, C.W. Kauffman, and M. Sichel.
                  "Ignition and Volatile Combustion of Cellulosic Dust Particles", Philip J. 
              Austin, C.W. Kauffman, and M. Sichel.
