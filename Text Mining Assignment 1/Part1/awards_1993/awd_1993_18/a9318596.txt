Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9318596  Inan  This project will study the
              effect on the ionosphere and upper  atmosphere of electrons precipitated from
              the magnetosphere by  electromagnetic radiation originating in thunderstorms. 
              The phase  and amplitude of very low frequency (VLF) signals broadcast by a 
              number of transmitters located at various positions around the  world are
              perturbed by the precipitating electrons.  The  perturbations will be detected
              by VLF receivers located at Palmer  Station, the British Antarctic Survey's
              Rothera Base and the  Brazilian station on King George Island.  The project is
              a  cooperative effort of the Antarctic programs of United States,  Brazil and
              the United Kingdom.    For many years Stanford University has been a leader in
              the study  of VLF phenomena in the near Earth space environment.  ***
