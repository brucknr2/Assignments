Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. S.C. Foster of the Chemistry Department of Florida State   University
              will conduct a series of investigations in the high resolution   infrared
              spectroscopy of Jahn-Teller active molecules.  A novel high   frequency
              modulated corona- excited supersonic jet discharge will be used   to produce
              the species of interest. The methoxy, thiomethoxy, and methyl   nitrene
              radicals will be investigated.    While there have been many investigations of
              the   rotation-vibration-electronic spectra of polyatomic molecules, there have
                been relatively few which deal with the radicals of such molecules.  This  
              paucity of such investigations is generally due to the great reactivity   of
              these species and thus the difficulties encountered in producing   sufficient
              amounts of them suitable for experimental study.  In radical   species which
              are expected to possess axial symmetry this is often not   the case.  The
              radicals are distorted away from their expected symmetry   due to a special
              interaction between the electronic motions and some of   the vibrational modes.
               This is known as the Jahn-Teller effect.  This   research is devoted to the
              study of Jahn-Teller active molecules with the   aim to establish a data base
              suitable for the development of appropriate   theoretical models.
