              CTS-9318694  Iowa State University  Cheng S. Lee    ABSTRACT    The aim of this
              project is to understand certain factors in capillary zone electrophoresis
              (CZE) in order to develop gradient elution High Performance Capillary
              Electrophoresis.  The magnitude and polarity of the  SYMBOL 122 \f "Symbol" 
              potential strongly influences protein adsorption as well as the direction and
              magnitude of electroosmotic flow.  For this project, a radial potential
              gradient will be tested as a means of varying the  SYMBOL 122 \f "Symbol" 
              potential and thereby reducing protein adsorption and enhancing the revolving
              power of the technique.  Dispersion studies under a hydrostatic pressure-driven
              flow component will be conducted in a set of tests in which the fractional
              length of the capillary under electroosmotic control will be changed.  A series
              capacitance model combined Gouy-Chapman-Stern-Grahame theory will be evaluated
              with experimental results.    CZE is a very promising technique that offers the
              analytical capabilities of electrophoresis and the convenience of HPLC.  Its
              development will provide a powerful tool in support of the biotechnology and
              pharmaceutical industries.     IBMBIO  COM'           `        IBMDOS  COM'
