Abstract    :
                   9318900  James Dietz    During its lifetime, an individual primate faces an
              array of  critical life history decisions, such as mate choice and  timing of
              dispersal and reproduction.  The outcome of each  of these decisions impacts
              directly on survivorship and  fecundity, and natural selection should favor
              those  individuals that make appropriate choices.  Primate research  has rarely
              been at the forefront in evolutionary biological  work, because of a) their
              longevity, b) their complex social  behavior, and c) their relatively low
              population numbers.    This study, by contrast, on the golden lion tamarins in 
              Brazil, has developed a research system that permits  circumvention of these
              obstacles.  The investigators have  identified the critical life history
              junctures for this  species, and have documented a good many rare variations. 
              They believe that it is the exceptions to common patterns  that hold the key to
              understanding the factors that shaped  the evolution of life history traits. 
              During the next three  years, they will intensify  the study of variation in
              choice  for several critical life history decisions, and test them  with strict
              hypothesis tests.  The long term goal of the  research is to construct a model
              based on evolutionary and  ecological theory that will allow us to predict
              individual  choice at these decision junctures.
