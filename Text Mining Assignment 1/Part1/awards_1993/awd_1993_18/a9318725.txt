Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Giacinto Scoles of Princeton University will apply  
              molecular beams to study the dynamics of molecular systems, particularly  
              highly vibrationally excited (HVE) molecules.  Intramolecular Vibrational  
              Redistribution (IVR)  in isolated molecules as well as the dynamics of   HVE
              molecules colliding with surfaces will be the focus of most of this   research.
               Molecules will be excited in  high vibrational levels in   supersonic beams
              and then directed onto surfaces.  In other studies HVE   polyatomics will be
              examined in the gas phase in the frequency domain to   determine the effect of
              high energies which may be above barriers for   bond breaking or isomerization.
                 In these studies Scoles will be examining molecules which are highly  
              energized in terms of the internal motions of the atoms relative to one  
              another.  Such molecules are usually more reactive than they are in their  
              unenergized state.  Hence, this project will be able to shed some light   on
              many different types of chemical processes, from combustion to surface  
              oxidation and catalysis.
