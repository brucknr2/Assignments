Abstract    :
              9318515  Denton  This award is for support for a two year study to improve the 
              understanding of Pliocene glacial history and landscape evolution  of the
              Transantarctic Mountains in order to reconcile conflicting  hypotheses of
              Antarctic climate and associate ice response during  Pliocene warm intervals. 
              The new field area to be studied is the  Royal Society Range, which has
              extensive areas free of ice and is  adjacent both to the Dry Valleys and to
              large off-shore  volcanoes.  These unique circumstances suggest that critical 
              Pliocene chronologic, stratigraphic, paleoclimatic, and surface  uplift data
              will be well preserved in this area.  The glacial and  tectonic information
              that will be derived from the Royal Society  Range should greatly clarify two
              important and intertwined  problems of Antarctic science:  Pliocene ice-sheet
              stability and  the evolution of the Transantarctic Mountains.  ***
