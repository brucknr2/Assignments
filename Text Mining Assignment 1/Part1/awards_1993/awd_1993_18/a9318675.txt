Abstract    :
              9318675  Karasov         Feeding and digestion rates of some birds are
              particularly  high during fattening prior to migration, during wintertime 
              exposure to low temperature, and during postnatal growth. The  PI  will study
              how the avian gut adjusts to high feeding rate because  it is important and has
              been little studied. The adjustments are  important because they might
              influence stop-over times during  migration, wintertime distribution of birds,
              and the evolution of  growth and development patterns. Study of the gut 
              adjustments of  birds will also complement similar kinds of studies in mammals 
              that have biomedical significance. Finally, knowledge of  digestive
              capabilities and limitations should help in the design  of artificial diets for
              animals in captivity, and hence improve  husbandry practices for both
              endangered species in zoological  parks and animals with economic value.      
              The PI will study gastrointestinal adjustments to high  feeding rate in several
              avian species during migration, cold  acclimation, and postnatal growth. The PI
              will test for changes  in digesta retention time, amount of gastrointestinal
              tissue, and  tissue-specific levels of digestive enzymes and nutrient 
              absorption. These features are chosen because they determine  features of
              whole-animal nutritional performance such as  digestive efficiency and rate.
