Abstract    :
              9318524 Reid  This award provides funding for the first year of a three-year
              continuing award for the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research" Program at
              the Oklahoma State University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              for Web Handling.  The Center has demonstrated successful research support from
              industrial members and has met the review criteria of I/UCRC Program.   
              Funding is also provided to support an evaluator at the Center to continue the
              evaluation responsibility on monitoring the industry/university interaction in
              the Center.    The U.S. Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and
              Waste Management Office is providing funding to obtain a non-voting membership
              in the Center.  Additional funding is provided for a woman undergraduate
              student to aid the Center in its's ongoing research activities.      The
              Program Manager recommends the Oklahoma State University be awarded:   $33,000
              for the first year of a three-year continuing award (includes $8,000 for
              evaluator support); $5,000 for one year to support an undergraduate student;
              and $10,000 for one year with funds provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. 
              This continuing grant should be processed as a unilateral action with $10,000
              funded in FY93 with funds provided by the Department of Energy and $38,000
              funded with FY94 funds with no other action required.  Near the end of each
              12-month period the Program Manager and/or the Division Director of the
              Engineering Education Centers Division will review the progress of the Center
              on a number of renewal criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the
              extent to which the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the
              extent to which  the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the
              Program Manager will recommend support for the next period of this continuing
              award.
