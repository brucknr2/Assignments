Abstract    :
              9318823  Simmons   Transposable elements (TEs) are genetic sequences found in
              all organisms that can cause a wide variety of deleterious  effects when they
              move from one chromosomal site to another.  TEs can be transmitted both from
              parent to offspring (vertically) and from one host species to another
              (laterally), so that their behavior resembles that of a parasite.  Dr. Simmons
              is interested in determining the pattern and relative frequency of such lateral
              transfer events to hobo, a transposable element in the insect genus Drosophila.
               Her previous published work showed that active hobo elements have been
              laterally transferred among four species within the Drosophila in the recent
              past.  Recent work indicates, however, that hobo sequences in other Drosophila
              species may have been vertically transmitted.   Dr. Simmons will perform a more
              complete analysis of lateral vs. vertical transmission of hobo in Drosophila by
              cloning and DNA-sequencing full-length copies of the element from several
              species Drosophila.  The sequences will be used to construct a "family tree"
              for the hobo element in these species, and the resulting tree will be compared
              to a tree to be constructed for the host species.  Places where the two trees
              have the same form will indicate species in which hobo has been vertically
              transmitted, while places where the two trees are not congruent indicate
              potential lateral transfer events.  These studies will form the backbone of the
              efforts to understand the frequency of the mechanisms of lateral genetic
              transfer events occurring in all sorts of organisms.
