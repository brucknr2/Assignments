              Title: An Interdisciplinary Research Program in Climatology    Numerical
              climate models are used to study how changes in the  earth's orbital
              parameters, the height of mountains and plateaus,  and the location of
              continents may have influenced the evolution of  earth's climate.  The results
              of climate model experiments are then  compared with the appropriate geological
              records to test the  accuracy of the models and to understand the processes
              involved in  large climatic changes.  These processes include changes in 
              atmospheric circulation, sea-ice, ocean currents, land vegetation,  carbon
              dioxide content of the atmosphere, ice sheets, and sea-level  and, therefore,
              an interdisciplinary approach is required.  These  studies will contribute to a
              better understanding of earth's  climatic history and to an assessment of the
              accuracy of climate  models for estimating possible future global change.
