Abstract    :
              9318484  Hawkridge  This award is made in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry 
              Program in support of the research of Dr. Sarah Rutan. The  research is aimed
              at elucidating the role of the solvated  stationary phase in reversed phase
              liquid chromatography. This  will be achieved through the use of indicators
              whose UV-visible  absorbance maxima are dependent on their molecular 
              environments. Solvatochromic parameters describing the 
              dipolarity/polarizability, hydrogen bond acidity and hydrogen  bond basicity
              will be determined. Spectra of various indicators  in mixed aqueous/organic
              supensions of stationary phase  particles which have been derivatized with
              alkyl chains will be  obtained using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.
              Interferences  from dye molecules that remain in the bulk mobile phase will be 
              eliminated using adaptive filtering techniques.  In a related  study, factor
              analysis methods will be used to aid in the  development of methods for the
              prediction of infinite dilution  activity coefficients and heats of solution,
              based on these  solvatochromic parameters.    The combination of improved
              modeling techniques and the  development of parameters describing the chemistry
              of the  chromatographic phases should ultimately allow the researcher  to
              predict retention characteristics for solutes in reversed  phase liquid
              chromatography. This capability will be of  significant benefit across a broad
              range of industrial and  medically related separations and may also prove
              valuable to  the characterization of other interfacial systems.
