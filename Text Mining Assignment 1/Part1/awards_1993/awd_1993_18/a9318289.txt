Abstract    :
                     9318289  Earle    This project involves the dissertation research of a
              student in  cultural anthropology from UCLA.  The student will study how 
              indigenous households use new commodities and traditional goods  to establish
              social and economic relations.  Using ethnographic  methods of intensive
              interviews, surveys, and participant  observation, the student will see how the
              types of resources  people control affect their appreciation and use of
              prestige  objects.   This research is important because trade in imported goods
              is  ubiquitous and growing.  Understanding how "traditional" peoples 
              appreciate and use goods, both imported and domestic, to affect  their social
              status, can help us predict future trends in  markets.   ***
