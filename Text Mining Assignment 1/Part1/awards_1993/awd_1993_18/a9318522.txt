Abstract    :
                          9318522  Kieber  This a starter grant for the NSF Postdoctoral
              Research Fellow in  Plant Biology.  Dr. Kieber has completed his tenure as the
              NSF  Postdoctoral Fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Joseph Ecker at  University
              of Pennsylvania and is now Assistant Professor in the  Department of Biological
              Sciences at the Unversity of Illinois at  Chicago.  With this starter award,
              Dr. Kieber plans to initiate his  independent research program with a long-term
              goal of understanding  the mode of action of the plant hormone, ethylene. 
              Specifically,  Dr. Kieber will further characterize a mutant of Arabidopsis 
              thaliana, ctr 1.  This mutant is deficient in ethylene perception  in both
              seedlings and adult plants.  There is some evidence to  indicate that the ctr1
              gene product may encode for a kinase.  It is  hoped that the results from these
              studies will build the foundation  for continued studies of the important
              problem in plant biology.  ***
