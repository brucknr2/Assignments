Abstract    :
              This project will research the relationship between incompressible  and
              compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, including  observable
              consequences in the solar wind, such as characteristic  anisotropies in the
              inner wind and scalings of various fluctuations  in the outer heliosphere.  A
              transport theory for description of  the long wavelength and low frequency
              variations of local MHD  turbulence will be further exploited to address
              important  observational issues in the solar wind.  Extensions of this theory 
              will describe assimilation of waves injected by wave-particle  interactions
              associated with upstream waves, as well as waves  associated with pickup and
              assimilation of newborn cometary and  interstellar ions.  Further work in basic
              MHD theory will include  development and refinement of a phenomenology of MHD
              relaxation  processes based upon an information-entropy description which has 
              recently shown promise in the context of two dimensional  hydrodynamics
              turbulence.  Finally, the investigators will  construct models for including
              turbulence effects in self-  consistent models of solar wind acceleration, and
              self-consistent  models for charged particle-wave turbulence dynamics near
              comets  and shocks.
