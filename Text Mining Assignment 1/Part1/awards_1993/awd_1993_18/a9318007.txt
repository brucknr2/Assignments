Abstract    :
              9318007  Kim    Although it has been known since the 1920's that retinol, a form
               of vitamin A, is absolutely essential for sperm production, it is  still
              unknown as to why retinol is required. Clearly, retinol is  a signaling
              molecule that uses protein mediators to control the  expression of  genes
              critical for sperm production. In this  proposal, two important protein
              mediators that work together,  kinases and phosphatases which modulate the
              activity of proteins  that control the retinol-regulated gene expression, will
              be  investigated using the testis. The information gained will be  useful to
              formulate strategies to either increase or decrease  male reproductive
              efficiency.  ***
