Abstract    :
              9318491  Horel       Recent studies have shown that the National Meteorological 
              Center's regional forecast model, known as the "ETA" model, does  poorly in
              predicting heavy precipitation outbreaks over central  Arizona during the
              summer.  The principal investigators believe  that this may be due to the way
              in which certain physical processes  over complex terrain are handled in the
              model.  Accordingly, they  will undertake a systematic evaluation of the skill
              of this model  over the western United States as a function of synoptic weather
               situation and season.  They plan to employ observations from a  series of
              recent field experiments, the Southwest Area Monsoon  Project (SWAMP), in this
              part of the study.  In addition, they will  evaluate the ETA model's physical
              parameterizations in regions of  complex terrain. In carrying out this project,
              the PIs will work  closely with personnel at NMC and operational meteorologists
              in the  Western Region of the National Weather Service.       This project is
              supported as part of the NSF/NMC Joint Program  in Numerical Weather
              Prediction.  ***
