Abstract    :
              9318935  Pinkerton  Geneva College requests support from NSF for connection of
              its  campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network located  in
              the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide operations  management and
              information services and it will give Geneva College  connection to the NSFNET,
              a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second) National Backbone network.   
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access
              supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to
              implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty research will
              benefit from the link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for the school to
              explore innovative  educational resources.
