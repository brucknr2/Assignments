Abstract    :
              9318385  Schweitzer    Technical abstract:  Recent observations have provided
              evidence for  an unusual metal-insulator (MI) transition in the layered ternary
               sulfide compound BaCo1-xNixS2-y.  A preliminary interpretation  proposes that
              the transition is from a two-dimensional  antiferromagnetic semiconductor to a
              metal with decreasing  temperature.  This MI transition will be investigated in
              detail  using resistivity, Hall effect, dc and ac susceptibility, and  infrared
              absorption techniques.  The results will be compared with  the ternary compound
              in which Ni is replaced by Cu.  The materials  will be structurally analyzed by
              x-ray powder diffraction.   Theoretical model Hamiltonians used will be similar
              to those  employed previously for La2CuO with appropriate parameters for the 
              BaCo1-xMxS2-y system and with disorder treated within the coherent  potential
              approximation.    Non-technical abstract:  An unusual transition has been
              discovered  recently in material containing Ba, Co, Ni (orCu), and S atoms.  
              The transition is from a semiconductor to a metal as the  temperature is
              decreased.  This unusual transition will be  investigated in greater detail
              using experimental and theoretical  techniques.  The thermal bistability and
              positive temperature  coefficient of resistivity associated with this
              transition suggests  that the material could be useful for a variety of
              electro-optic  applications.  ***
