Abstract    :
              9318383  Spilhaus  This award will support participant support costs for
              attendance at the Chapman  Conference on The Physics of the Magnetopause, to be
              held in San Diego, California,  March 14-18, 1994.  Chapman Conferences are
              topical meetings sponsored by the  American Geophysical Union and are designed
              to promote opportunities not normally  available through the format of larger
              meetings.  The magnetopause is the outer  boundary of the magnetosphere and is
              the site of many complex plasma phenomena.   Understanding these processes is
              important in explaining the entry of solar wind  plasma into the magnetosphere.
               The conference will bring together leading experts  and students to discuss
              current research and future efforts.  ***
