Abstract    :
              9318695  Sauer  This project will investigate the fundamental principles of load
               modeling to establish a theoretical basis for generic load  representations. 
              The investigation will work from the framework  of time-scale separation and
              singular perturbation as the primary  mathematical basis for static models. 
              From this, characteristics  such as frequency and voltage dependence will be
              examined.   Dynamic load models will then be investigated  to determine which 
              structure captures the important physical load characteristics  while also
              remaining computationally efficient.  Issues which  will require clarification
              include the differences between the  frequency of load voltage and the
              frequency of load current  during transients with the quasistatic
              approximation.  The proper  dependence of quasi-static load power on bus
              voltage, and other  dynamic quantities will be investigated.    ***
