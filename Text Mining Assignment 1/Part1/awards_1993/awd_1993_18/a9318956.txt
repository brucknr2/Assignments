Abstract    :
              The proposed research deals with analytically verifying the  satisfaction of
              timing constraints of component interfaces in board  level circuits.  A
              methodology, VITCh (VLSI Interface Timing  Checker), that will allow the
              analytic timing verification of  realistic board-level circuits through new
              models of behavior and  verification is proposed.  A hierarchial model of
              interface  behavior that allows the task to be decomposed to minimize overall 
              complexity is also proposed.  The proposed model will allow  efficient timing
              analysis of board-level circuits and thereby  enable the analytical
              verification of large and complex circuits  that existing approaches are unable
              to verify.  A CAD system  implementing VITCh to provide a testbed for
              experimentally  validating the model and methodology is proposed as part of the
               project.  The proposer attempts to solve the timing analysis  problem by
              decomposing the task into several subtasks that can be  executed concurrently. 
              Each subtask is performed such that timing  constraints are verified during the
              process of circuit behavior  enumeration and eliminates the need to build and
              analyze composite  representations of circuit behavior.  The research plan
              includes  testing VITCh on circuits ranging from tens to hundreds of 
              components to establish the range of applicability of the algorithm  as a
              function of circuit size.
