Abstract    :
              9318850  Shell       Adrian College requests support from NSF for a connection
              of  its campus network to Michnet and NSFNET.  Michnet is the  midlevel network
              located in the state of Michigan that will  provide operations and network
              information services.  It will  give Adrian College a 56 thousand bits per
              second connection to  the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
              second)  National Backbone network.       The College needs greater
              functionality and network speed to  be able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail  system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.   This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore  innovative
              educational resources.
