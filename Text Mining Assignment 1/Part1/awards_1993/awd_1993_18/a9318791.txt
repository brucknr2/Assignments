Abstract    :
              Over the past seven years there has been an increasing interest in database
              programming languages that  has resulted in a number of working prototypes and
              has influenced, for example, the design of query  languages for object-oriented
              databases. This research is now taking on new directions. It includes 
              foundations of database programming languages, bulk types and iterators, types
              and data models,  distributed object stores, heterogeneous databases,
              interoperability and communication with structured  text. Much of this research
              stems from co-operation between groups of researchers in the US and EC,  and
              the objective is to maintain this cooperative research through a series of
              joint workshops that  include the continuation of the Database Programming
              Language and Persistent Object Store workshops as well as new workshops on
              Finite Model theory, Data Exchange Formats, and Data Mapping and Matching.  The
              results of these workshops, which will be published as conference proceedings,
              will provide new techniques for querying and and integrating not only standard
              database systems but also the wide variety of oth er structured data sources
              that are used, for example, for the representation of  scientific data.
