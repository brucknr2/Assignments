Abstract    :
              9318402  Sandgren   This research will provide a rigorous test of predation as a
              primary factor in determining prey biogeography. The PI's will test the
              possibility that the biogeographical distribution of many groups of algae, such
              as chrysophyte flagellates, is primarily the result of strong predator-prey
              interactions with the herbivorous zooplankton, Daphnia. There is a strong
              negative correlation between the distribution of Chrysophyte algae and lake
              productivity. While Daphnia has been identified as a dominant herbivore in lake
              food webs, it has not been previously emphasized as affecting the distribution
              of chrysophytes among lakes. Alternative hypotheses, such as competition
              between algae for nutrients, will be considered, as well. Predictions from
              these hypotheses will be test with a combination of laboratory and field
              experiments, modeling competition among algae species, and sampling empirical
              distribution of algae, Daphnia, and lake productivity.  %%%  This research is
              important because it will test a novel and important hypothesis regarding the
              biogeographic distribution and abundance of species in response to predator
              densities and habitat productivity. Because some algal blooms can cause poor
              water quality in reservoirs, these results will have important implications for
              assessing the biotic factors that contribute to lake water quality.  ***
