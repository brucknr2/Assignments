Abstract    :
                              9318660  Rincon  The subject of this research is the
              relationship between aluminum  (Al) accumulation and the sensitivity of plants
              to this element.   The goals of this project are: (1) to determine whether or
              not Al  accumulation in the root meristems of wheat correlates with 
              differential sensitivity to Al; (2) to explore mechanisms of Al  uptake in the
              root meristems at tissue and cellular levels; (3) to  explore whether
              mobilization of Al out of the root tissue and cells  plays a role in Al
              tolerance mechanisms; (4) to investigate the  nature of Al transport at the
              organ and cellular level; (5) to  define the effects of Al on the uptake and
              distribution of ions in  the root tips.  These objectives will be achieved by
              using intact  and excised wheat root tissue and isolated protoplasts.  Analyses
               of Al content in the tissues and protoplasts will be performed by  specific
              ion chromatography.  Overall, the findings of this  investigation may lead to a
              better understanding of Al stress  tolerance mechanisms.  ***
