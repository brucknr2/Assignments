Abstract    :
              ***  9318773  Tuzhilin  More and more application domains, from financial market
              analysis to weather prediction, from monitoring supermarket purchases to
              monitoring satellite images, are becoming increasingly data-intensive. For this
              reason, the area of knowledge discovery in databases has recently attracted
              much interest of database researchers. Since many data mining applications are
              temporal in nature, it is important to study the problems of pattern discovery
              in the temporal database context. The purpose of this project is to (1) develop
              a framework for the characterization and classification of temporal patterns;
              (2) identify and characterize various types of pattern discovery problems
              within the proposed framework; (3) evaluate the applicability of existing
              techniques from artificial intelligence, operations research, signal
              processing, statistical time-series analysis, and other related disciplines to
              the problems from part (2), and to develop new temporal pattern discovery
              techniques, whenever necessary -- also these techniques should be made more
              efficient, if possible; and (4) parallelize the discovery algorithms in order
              to make them computationally feasible; this is important because temporal
              pattern discovery problems typically deal with large volumes of data. As a
              result of this project, a system will be developed that helps a user to
              discover knowledge from a large volume of temporal data. This research will
              provide a better theoretical understanding of the problems of pattern discovery
              in temporal databases, as well as provide some practical tools for finding
              patterns in temporal data. Potential applications of this work include
              financial, marketing, and medical applications, among others.  ***
