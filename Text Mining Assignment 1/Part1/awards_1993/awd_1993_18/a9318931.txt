Abstract    :
                  9318931  Tombrello    The damage left by MeV ions in electronic materials is
               important in many respects.  The ability to perform  materials modifications
              such as deep implantations into III-  V semiconductors, and to remove residual
              crystal damage  without disturbing the electronic modification and 
              compositional mixing that were the intent of the ion  bombardment depends in an
              essential way on knowledge of the  processes that created the damage and the
              resulting  character of the irradiated material. The proposed research  focuses
              on these basic issues.  Our approach is to produce  ion damage in crystalline
              samples of electronic materials  (insulators, compound semiconductors, highTc 
              superconductors, and a few special metals) and to study the  damage
              distributions by a variety of techniques; for  example, the use of channeling
              RBS to deduce the track radii  and damage distributions.  We have developed a
              model of the  track-damage process that shows considerable promise; some  of
              the initial observations will test this model's validity.  %%%  The properties
              of electronic materials can be modified in  controlled ways by bombarding them
              with high energy(MeV)  ions. In some cases this irradiation is used to implant 
              foreign atoms deep in the material to tailor its local  electronic properties.
              In other cases the damage itself may  cause beneficial changes, for example,
              improving the current-  carrying capacity of superconductors. This research
              project  expects to increase our basic understanding of the damage  produced by
              such bombardments so that we can design, and  more efficiently realize desired
              modifications of electronic  materials for gaining improvements in the general 
              performance of advanced devices and integrated circuits used  in computing,
              information processing, and tele  communications.  ***
