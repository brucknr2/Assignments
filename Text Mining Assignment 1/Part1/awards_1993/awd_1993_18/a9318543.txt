Abstract    :
              9318543  Letourneau     Understanding the forces that structure biotic
              communities is of fundamental importance in ecology, conservation, biology, and
              biological control (agriculture).  Yet there is currently no consensus about
              whether predators usually control community structure (top-down control), or
              whether plant productivity usually controls community structure (bottom-up
              control).  This research will use an experimental system of one plant species
              (Piper cenocladum), several insect herbivore species, one predatory ant
              species, and two ant predator species, to test these alternatives for the first
              time in a tropical terrestrial ecosystem.  The project uses common-garden
              experiments to assess the effects of the fourth trophic level (ant predators)
              on the dynamics of secondary and primary consumers, and producers (top-down),
              and to quantify the effects of nutrient and light enhancement on the plants and
              on higher trophic levels (bottom-up).    %%%  Results from this research will
              provide important insights into the relative strengths of top-down and
              bottom-up controls in tropical terrestrial ecosystems.  The results will
              advance our understanding of how terrestrial ecosystems are structured and how
              ants, plants, and herbivores interact.  The results of this research will also
              have potential applications in conservation biology and in the development of
              biological control systems for agriculture and forestry.  ***
