Abstract    :
              9318747  Weishampel    The proposal research aims at examining the ecological
              and  evolutionary patterns of interactions between living rhinoceros  species
              and the plants they feed upon. This analysis will be  based  on skeletal
              morphology treating the subjects as if they  were extinct, thus forming samples
              much like those available from  the fossil record. Using this perspective the
              chewing  capability  among rhinos will be compared to  the toughness of leaves
              of  plants associated with these rhinos. This form-function  relationship is
              evaluated using computer modeling techniques. If  the chewing capability of
              these living herbivores is correlated  to physical properties of their food,
              such as toughness, similar  kinds of analyses will be possible on fossil
              material providing  important insights into the ecology and behavior of extinct
               animals.  ***
