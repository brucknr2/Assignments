Abstract    :
              9318770  Jacobs    Color vision is extremely valuable for discriminating objects
              and  yielding information about the contents of objects.  Primates are  often
              considered to have the keenest sense of color among mammals,  but we have data
              on only about 20 of the roughly 200 non-human  primate species.  Recent
              findings show that the distribution of two  or three distinct photopigments,
              termed dichromacy or trichromacy  respectively, is far more complex than
              earlier understood, with a  genetic polymorphism in the types of pigment in the
              photoreceptor  cone cells of the eye, showing a striking gender difference in
              the  squirrel monkey.  This project uses a portable, non-invasive set of 
              electrophysiological and behavioral tests to evaluate the  correctness of
              emerging views on primate color vision and its  evolution.  Species to be
              tested have been selected for  particularly appropriate comparisons to
              rigorously examine the  generalization about high individual variation among
              the group  known as the New World monkeys, the generalization about little 
              variation and human-like properties of trichromacy of the Old World  monkeys,
              and to extend the very limited knowledge about the  prosimians which are a very
              important group for understanding the  evolutionary issues.  The impact of
              these studies will continue to  extend beyond visual neuroscience into
              anthropology, molecular  evolution, and genetics, and the testing methodology
              may stimulate  novel efficient tests for human adult and infant visual 
              capabilities.     ***
