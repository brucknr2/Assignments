Abstract    :
              9318116  Plutchak  The Saint Louis University Medical Center requests support to
               provide NSFNET access to faculty, staff, and residents with  permanent and
              temporary university assignments at detached sites.   Funds available through
              the "Connections to NSFNET" program will be  used to purchase networking
              hardware necessary to connect both  local facilities of the Veterans Affair
              Hospital, St. Mary' Health  Center, Deaconess Hospital, The Eye Institute, and
              The Institute of  Molecular Virology.  The proposed interconnections consist of
              a  combination of dial-up, leased line, and direct connect equipment.  
              Installation of a dial-up bank of modems allow researchers to  access the
              network from nearly anywhere they might be: home; office  or hotel.  The
              proposed network will significantly enhance the  education and research
              activities of the faculty and residents from  Saint Louis University that work
              at these affiliated sites.  ***
