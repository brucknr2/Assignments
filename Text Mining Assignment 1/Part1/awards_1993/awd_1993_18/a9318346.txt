Abstract    :
              9318346  Haymon       This award provides one-half of the funding required to 
              purchase a powder X-ray diffractometer system to be  installed and operated in
              the Department of Geological  Sciences at the University of California at Santa
              Barbara.  The University is committed to providing the remaining funds 
              necessary for the acquisition. The new X-ray diffractometer  will replace a
              32-year old instrument no longer capable of  providing the type of data
              required by numerous research and  teaching programs at the institution. Among
              the research  projects that will use the new instrumentation: (1) A time- 
              series study of mineralization at hydrothermal vents on the  East Pacific Rise
              crest, (2) Studies of chemical diagenesis  and pore fluid movement in
              sedimentary basins, (3) Marine  sediment records of Cenozoic
              paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic  evolution, (4) Coral records of Cenozoic
              chemical  fluctuations in upwelling zones, (5) Regional  thermobarometric
              studies of metamorphic terranes, and (6)  Studies of silicate melt-transport
              properties.  ***
