Abstract    :
              9318047  Herman      Eicosanoids are biomedically important hormones.  They have
               diverse actions including effects on blood clotting,  inflammation,
              anaphylaxis, and cardiovascular and nervous system  regulation in mammals. 
              Eicosanoids include  prostaglandins and  leukotrienes and are synthesized from
              arachidonic acid, a  polyunsaturated fatty acid found in cell membranes.  When
              diets  high in fish are consumed, membranes contain high quantities of 
              eicosapentaenoic acid and the eicosanoids synthesized from this  fatty acid
              have less biological activity.  While much work has  been done on the
              biochemistry and physiology  of eicosanoids in  mammals, much less is known of
              their roles in other animals.  White blood cells in mammals produce
              leukotrienes, but red cells  lack this capacity.  However, bullfrog red blood
              cells synthesize  leukotrienes, therefore, regulation of synthesis will be 
              investigated.  Frog membranes contain high levels of  eicosapentaenoic acid
              which may affect synthesis.  Leukotrienes  may act by stimulating synthesis of
              prostaglandins, and this will  be investigated using isolated bullfrog lung
              strips.  Since  antagonism of leukotriene effects is biomedically important, 
              receptor antagonists will be tested in cannulated bullfrogs in  vivo. 
              Amphibian tissues are simpler than their mammalian  counterparts, therefore,
              mechanisms and results will be easier to  interpret.  This research will
              provide insight into the evolution  of these biomedically important compounds.
