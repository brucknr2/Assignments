Abstract    :
              9318981  Grace       Marymount University requests support from NSF for
              connection  of its campus network to VERnet.  VERnet is the midlevel network 
              located in the state of Virginia.  VERnet will provide operations  management
              and information services and it will give Marymount  University connection to
              the NSFNET, a high (1.5 - 45 million bits  per second) National Backbone
              network.       The University needs greater functionality and network speed  to
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file  transfers along
              with being able to implement a more reliable mail  system.  Students and
              faculty research will benefit from the link.   This is also a unique
              opportunity for the school to explore  innovative educational resources.
