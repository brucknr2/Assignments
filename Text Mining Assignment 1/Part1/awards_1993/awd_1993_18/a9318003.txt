Abstract    :
              9318003  McGinley     Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi form
              associations with many species of plants.  These associations are thought to be
              mutualistic.  Recently, however, the constancy of this putative mutualism has
              been questioned.  This project examines the geographic variation in the costs
              and benefits of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal associations with little
              bluestem grass.  A full factorial design is used to examine the growth
              characteristics of grasses and fungi from four geographic regions grown in a
              common environment.  The growth of plants and fungi in all combinations of
              local fungal and grass races and soil types will be measured.  %%%  It is
              important to examine the costs and benefits of VAM fungi-plant associations in
              more detail than in previous studies.  This study is novel in providing
              information on the geographic basis of variation in the nature of the symbiotic
              relationship.  Results from this research will provide important information
              on: 1) geographic variation in the importance of the mycorrhizal association,
              2) the effect of the variation in mycorrhizal infection and soil
              characteristics on plant growth and allocation patterns, and 3) the effects of
              plant characteristics and soil on fungal morphology and reproduction.  The
              results of this research will have potential applications in forestry,
              agriculture, and conservation biology.  ***
