              This National Challenge award will support a multidisciplinary group of
              computer scientists and biologists to develop distributed imaging technologies
              of a gigabit network.  The objectives of this project include implementation,
              experimentation with and demonstration of high performance computing and
              communication technology focused on research in 3-D microscope; designing and
              experimental evaluation of a number of key networking and protocol control
              mechanisms to allow multirate network access to support distributed computing
              involving multimedia, visualization and multiparticipant collaborations;
              deployment of an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) gigabit network providing
              connectivity among participating facilities at Washington University and at
              lower rates between Washington University and NIH.  Thus, the project effort
              includes important research on 3-D microscopy necessary for the Human Brain
              Project initiative, requiring the development of gigabit network technology and
              associated high speed communication protocols. This award is being jointly
              supported by the following NSF program s:  New Technologies, Networking and
              Communications Research, and Computational Biology.
