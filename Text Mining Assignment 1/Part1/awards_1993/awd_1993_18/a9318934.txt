Abstract    :
              9318934  Abstract  Hobo is a transposable element found in the genome of
              Drosophila.  In the X chromosome, the interaction of these elements has been 
              found to result in chromosomal rearrangements. This hobo activity  can be
              repressed by genetic factor(s) present in the genome of the  Oregon R (OR)
              strain of fruit fly. This repression is complete and  our data suggest that
              zygotic expression of either chromosomal  genes or defective hobo elements, or
              a combination of those factors  are responsible for the repression. The primary
              goal of this  proposal is to identify and map these factors. A special genetic 
              strain with 95 defective hobo elements has been isolated from the  OR strain.
              The position of defective hobo elements in this strain  divides the genome into
              about 100 cytological regions. Through  genetic manipulations, the smallest
              number of regions that are  associated with the repression of Uc-1 hobo
              activity will be  identified. Cytogenetic analysis will be used to map the
              repression  to a more precise section within each region. In addition, 
              specially constructed plasmids will be introduced into the Uc-1   genome to
              test if antisense-hobo RNA can repress hobo activity.   %%%  Mapping a genetic
              function with defective transposable elements as  genetic markers is simple in
              concept; however, it has not been  attempted before. Our attempts to map the
              repressors of hobo  activity will provide information about the usefulness and 
              practicality of such an undertaking. It will also help us to  understand the
              process of hobo-mediated chromosome restructuring.  ***
