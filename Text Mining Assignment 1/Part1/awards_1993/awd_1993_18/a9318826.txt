Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Mark Stoneking/Steve Sherry  SBR- 9318826    The last
              decade has seen the adoption of molecular technology in surveys of human
              genetic diversity.  The purpose of these studies has been a clarification of
              the human evolutionary process.  One study in particular, from Alan Wilson's
              lab, initiated a vigorous period of research on the information contint of
              phylogenetic trees, their underlying assumptions and their potential role in
              reliably inferring past evolutionary events.  A second theoretical impetus
              centers on the effecto of ancient population growth on a type of molecular
              data: the distribution of pairwise mutational differences between individuals
              (called the mismatch distribution). Human mismatch distributions should
              preserva  record of popuations expansions and spearations in the remote past. 
              Expansion times have been identified for different populations from 30,000 to
              180,000 years ago, and that significant expansion occurred during thelate
              middle and upper Paleolithic (40,000 to 125,000 years ago).  The latest
              hypothesis to emerge from these sorts of studies center around a gradual Middle
              Paleolithic migration out of Africa followed by later regional episodes of
              rapid population growth during the Upper Paleolithic, although all inference is
              currently based on variation at a single genetic locus.    This project will
              satisfy the theoretical needs for multiple, independent measures of population
              diversity, by analyzing Alu repeats.  It will also further the technical
              capabilities of an excellent young scientist.    ***
