Abstract    :
              The grant requested in this proposal will support the  development of a
              technology for the fabrication of  microelectrode arrays ("probes"). The probes
              will be  capable of being inserted with minimal tissue trauma  into the brain,
              where they will record neuronal  signals. The arrays will be fabricated using
              silicon  micromachining methods, and will be tested in  anesthetized animals.
              CMOS integrated circuits will  also be designed, to amplify the signals
              recorded from  each of the several recording sites on a single probe,  and
              multiplex them onto a single output line.  Interconnect and encapsulation
              methods will be  developed to combine the probes and electronics into a 
              package suitable for use in animals. The probes will be  designed so that the
              CMOS electronics can ultimately be  integrated on a common substrate with the
              probes.    The probes will be used to obtain simultaneous  recordings from
              multiple sites in the mammalian brain.  Such recordings are used to obtain
              information that is  not available through other means, in order to learn 
              about how the brain works on the single-neuron and  network levels. The
              instruments to be developed under  this grant will greatly extend our ability
              to conduct  this basic neuroscience research.
