Abstract    :
              The benefits of mycorrhizae to plants in nature are not known. One presumed
              benefit of mycorrhizae is increae phosphorus uptake, but evidence for this is
              based mainly on greenhouse pot experiments. Newly developed techniques and an
              experimental rhizotron now make it possible to quantify the phosphorus made
              available to mature trees in nature by ectomycorrhizae. In addition, new
              observations and recording techniques using the Soil Biotron at the University
              of Michigan Biological Station make it possible to quantify effects of
              fungivory on phosphorus uptake by mycorrhizae. This research will determine (1)
              if trees and fungi use phosphorus stored in the ectomycorrhizal sheath
              asynchronously, (2) seasonal patterns of grazing by microarthropods on
              mycorrhizal fungi, and (3) seasonal patterns of phosphorus availability in the
              rhizosphere. Field observations will be conducted on white pine trees (Pinus
              strobus) and the common fungus, Cenococcum geophilum, in a mixed deciduous
              forest in northern Michigan.  %%%  Much previous research along these lines has
              been restricted to container experiments in greenhouses. This research will
              provide the first detailed study of phosphorus availability, phosphorus use,
              and grazing effects on mycorrhizal associations in a field situation.
