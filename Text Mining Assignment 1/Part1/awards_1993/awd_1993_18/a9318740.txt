Abstract    :
              9318740  Ginsberg    Technical abstract:  A praseodymium-doped high temperature 
              superconductor (yttrium-barium copper-oxide) will be investigated  above and
              below the superconducting transition temperature.   Measurements will include
              the electrical resistance, Hall effect,  critical current density, and magnetic
              irreversibility line.  The  focus will be on untwinned single crystals to avoid
              the effects of  twin boundaries and thus allow measurement of the anisotropy of
              the  electrical and magnetic properties.  Such measurements would not be 
              possible in polycrystalline samples or in twinned single crystals.   The
              information gained will cast light on inter-layer coupling and  magnetic pair
              breaking in high temperature superconductors.    Non-technical abstract:  A
              fundamental theory of high temperature  superconductors would cast light on the
              behavior of the electrons  in these fascinating materials.  Furthermore, it
              would facilitate  the efficient development of devices, such as high-speed
              circuits  and sensitive detectors of magnetic fields or electrical voltages.  
              To provide data for the development of the theory, we will measure  the
              electrical and magnetic properties of untwinned single crystals  of an
              important high temperature superconductor (yttrium-barium-  copper-oxide) to
              see the effects of replacing nonmagnetic (yttrium)  atoms with magnetic
              (praseodymium) atoms.  ***
