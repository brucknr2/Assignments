Abstract    :
              9318030  Gilman  The University of Southern California (USC) School of Medicine 
              respectfully requests $43,649.00 under the NSFNET Program to  install a fiber
              optic network link between the USC Health Sciences  Campus (including USC-owned
              and affiliated hospitals) and the Los  Angeles County + USC Medical Center (LAC
              + USC), one of the largest  acute-care facilities in the United States.  This
              link will allow  LAC + USC personnel including USC faculty and students based
              at  that location to utilize fully the resources accessible through  USCnet,
              NSFNET, the Internet, etc.  It will provide an enhanced  computing and
              communications capability and will make available a  greater array of
              information resources for research, patient care,  and education.  Most
              important, the link will provide an  environment which will encourage expanded
              utilization of computer-  based information and communications, the development
              of local area  networks, engagement in collaborative activities, and the
              sharing  of information.
