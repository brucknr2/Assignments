Abstract    :
              9318099  Howard    Long-term studies of natural populations, especially when 
              combined with experimental data, produce essential  information relevant to
              many theoretical and applied  biological issues.  For example, the significance
              of year-to-  year variations in population levels cannot be evaluated  properly
              without a database extending over considerable time  intervals.    Dr. Howard
              will conduct several types of research.  He will  continue long-term
              demographic data collection.  He will  also study the mechanisms animals use to
              choose their mates  and the effects of these choices on the biological success 
              of both males and females.  The results will be important  for theoretical
              understanding of the mechanisms and  evolution of mating behavior.  In
              addition, the resulting  basic information on natural breeding behavior will
              help  improve management programs, including captive breeding and  the
              reintroduction of captive-bred animals to their natural  habitats.
