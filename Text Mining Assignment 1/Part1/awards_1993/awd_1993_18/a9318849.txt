Abstract    :
                                                  9318849  Jackson         Despite extensive
              study, the properties of molecular gas in  the nuclei of external galaxies are
              poorly understood.  Previously  the molecular ISM in galaxies has been studied
              with CO emission,  which provides the distribution and mass of molecular gas.  
              Unfortunately, CO does not directly probe the dense molecular gas.   Dense gas
              is particularly important because it actively forms stars  and also traces the
              circumnuclear environment.  The Principal  Investigator will develop a new set
              of tools by observing  molecules such as HCN, which require high densities for
              excitation.  The technology is now in place to map these species in nearby 
              galaxies at 50 pc resolution.  By observing several lines he will  map in
              detail the density, temperature, composition, and motion of  the dense
              molecular gas in galactic nuclei.  He will perform HCN  surveys of a number of
              galaxies in order to characterize  their dense gas properties.
