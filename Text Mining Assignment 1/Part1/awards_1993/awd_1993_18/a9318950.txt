Abstract    :
              9318950  Jothimurugesan    This is an investigation of the hydrogenation of
              carbon monoxide  over cobalt-nickel alloy (Fischer-Tropsch) catalysts supported
              on  titania or vanadia.  One objective is to enhance the yield of  hydrocarbons
              in the gasoline range.  Catalysts are tested alone as  well as in combination
              with the zeolite HZSM-5.  The effects of  process variables such as
              temperature, pressure, space velocity,  carbon monoxide/hydrogen ratio, and the
              ratio of zeolite to  Fischer-Tropsch (cobalt-nickel) catalyst are investigated.
               The  issues addressed are significant in both synfuels and chemicals 
              production.    This is an award under the Research in Undergraduate
              Institutions  (RUI) announcement.  The effort will be performed with 
              undergraduates at a predominantly minority institution.  ***
