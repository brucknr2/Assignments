Abstract    :
              9318665  Duncan  An International Radiophysics Consortium is initiating
              long-range  facility, making use of existing and upgraded high-power HF 
              transmitting and receiving systems in Russia and Ukraine.  The goal  of this
              multinational collaborative effort is to develop a high-  power HF backscatter
              radar designed for unique observations of the  near-earth magnetosphere, the
              mid-latitude ionosphere, and the  middle and lower atmosphere.  Preliminary
              design and development  work for the necessary facility modifications has been
              completed by  staff of the Radiophysical Research Institute (NIRFI) in Nizhny 
              Novgorod, Russia.  The present proposal requests support for a  Small Grant for
              Exploratory research (SGER) to permit the immediate  commencement of
              construction of the required new transmitting  antenna, to be located at the
              existing Sura HF facility in  Vasilsursk, Russia (56.13oN,46.10oE).  It is
              extremely critical that  construction of the antenna begin in Summer, 1993;
              otherwise, NIRFI  personnel, equipment, and government support for this effort
              will  be reassigned to other activities and not be available for future 
              application to this project.    ***
