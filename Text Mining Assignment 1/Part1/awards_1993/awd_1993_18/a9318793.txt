Abstract    :
              931879  Edwards   Hawaii Institute of Geophysics (HIG) will develop an improved
              long-  range seafloor mapping system.  During the 1991-92 period, HIG  designed
              and built two new mapping systems in collaboration with  the U.S. Naval
              Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO).  The first one  served as the prototype and
              test platform for development of the  second -- SEAMAP.  This is a wide-swath,
              shallow-towed sonar  mapping system.  Both systems are fully operational and
              each has  carried out extensive seafloor surveying for applied as well as 
              basic research applications.  The systems provide a highly  expandable, modular
              architecture for development and extension of  capability.  Capability
              improvements will be made by building an 11  and 12 kHz shallow-towed sonar
              system that will have the basic  hardware functionality of the existing
              systems.  Software  improvements will also be made to acquire and process sonar
              data.   Because most of the improvements we are proposing to accomplish are 
              the by-products of software modifications, they can also be  incorporated into
              the existing systems that are used by the broad  marine geological community. 
              This work is being partially  supported by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office.
