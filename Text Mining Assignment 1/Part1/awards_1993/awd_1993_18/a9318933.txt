Abstract    :
                  This project will study job scheduling techniques for distributed memory
              parallel processors.  More specifically, the project will evaluate the
              performance of several strategies for sharing the processors and other
              resources of a multicomputer system among multiple, independent applications. 
              The evaluation will highlight the tradeoffs among the approaches and identify
              the conditions under which a strategy outperforms the others.  The evaluation
              will focus on both analytical methods and experimental evaluation using
              simulations.  Various applications that are typically executed on
              multicomputers will be used as system workload during the evaluation.  The
              results of the project will be valuable to OS level scheduling on future
              message passing MIMD systems.  ***
