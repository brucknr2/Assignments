Abstract    :
              9318160  Gross       The vast majority of ecological models applied to problems 
              in ecosystem analysis and management have relied on aggregative  properties of
              populations and communities.  This award will take  advantage of high
              performance computing systems to analyze new  models based upon interactions
              between  many individual organisms  which comprise these populations and
              communities.  These  individual-based models may be used to predict the
              dynamics of  populations and communities explicitly on a landscape, and thus 
              provide a method to analyze the effect of alternative spatially  explicit
              management schemes on ecosystems.  Massively parallel  machines offer the
              potential to deal with these analysis and  management problems, as well as
              taking account of the vast array  of information about individual organism
              difference that is  ignored in more aggregated modeling approaches.  This award
               involved the development and comparison of alternative methods to  implement
              individual-based modes on several high performance  computing systems and the
              application of results obtained to  several specific problems of ecosystem
              analysis and management,  in particular community-level interactions between
              several  species and explicit models of populations and communities.  This 
              award is being jointly supported by programs in Ecology,  Ecosystems, Applied
              Mathematics, Computational Mathematics and  Computational Biology.  ***
