Abstract    :
                This project will investigate improved discrimination network  structures,
              algorithms, and optimization techniques to speed up  production rule matching
              in active database systems.  Rete and  TREAT are well-known discrimination
              network structures used for  production rule matching.  The investigator has
              recently developed  a new discrimination network structure called the Gator
              network, or  Generalized TREAT/Rete network.  Gator networks are general rooted
               tree structures with the constraint that every inner node has two  or more
              children.  This is opposed to the binary tree structure of  Rete and the
              degenerate tree structure of TREAT.  Gator has the  potential to outperform
              both Rete and TREAT.    Since the Gator network structure is so general, it is
              essential  that an optimizer be developed to choose a good network for a rule. 
               Techniques for building an optimized Gator network for given  collection of
              rules, database, and update pattern will be  developed, and then tested and
              evaluated using simulation.  The  plan is to develop a Gator network optimizer
              that is similar in  structure to a query optimizer, but with a difference. 
              Unlike a  query optimizer, a Gator network optimizer must consider update 
              frequency in addition to database size, predicate selectivity,  presence of
              indexes and so on.
