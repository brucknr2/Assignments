Abstract    :
              9318890  Hughes  The flagella of the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium is a
              complex  organelle which is completely dispensable and thus amenable to 
              genetic dissection.  This research will focus on how the assembly  of the
              flagellar structure is regulated.  We have characterized a  gene, flg M, whose
              protein product regulates flagellin expression.   In cells unable to make a
              hook-basal body complex, the FlgM protein  prevents expression of flagellin
              genes.  This inhibition occurs by  interaction of FlgM with the alternative
              signa factor, o28, which  is specific for expression of the flagellin and
              chemotaxis genes  the details of the interaction between FlgM and o28 are being
               explored.  In cells with a functional hook-basal body complex, the  FlgM
              protein is transported by the flagellar-specific export  pathway through the
              intact hook-basal body structure and into the  growth medium.  The specific
              role of FlgM in flagellar regulation  remains to be determined and is a focus
              of this proposal.  When  plan to use FlgM export to initiate a general
              characterization of  the flagellar-specific export pathway.  Besides the flgM
              gene,  three other novel regulatory loci were discovered which affect 
              flagellin regulation.  These will be further characterized as well.   Finally,
              the role of FlgM in virulence suggests a broader role in  the central Biology
              of S. typhimurium and we plan to explore what  other pathways are regulated by
              FlgM.  %%%  This research will provide insight into a mechanism by which cells 
              can control the assembly of structures on the surface of bacteria  that have
              been shown to be involved in pathogenesis.  ***
