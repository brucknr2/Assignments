Abstract    :
              9318984  Reid    This award provides for continued technical support for the
              second Palomar  Sky Survey, a photographic survey of the Northern celestial
              hemisphere in  three passbands -- blue-green, red, and near-infrared.  The
              project is entering  its final phase, and it is expected that plate taking will
              be completed in late  1997.  This award helps maintain the photographic
              standards of the survey  through support of a photographic specialist.
