Abstract    :
              Winn/Abstract         The objective of this research is the electrical structure
              and  its evolution within thunderstorms particularly with respect to a  central
              hypothesis for the separation of change. A field experiment  will be conducted
              near Langmuir Laboratory (Socorro, NM) using an  instrumental aircraft, ballon
              borne devices designed to measure the  change on ice particles, and various
              electric field mills installed  near the observatory. A new feature of the
              aircraft, in addition to  an proved interpretation of the electric field
              measured by the  aircraft, will enable it to be quickly directed to regious of
              known  charge whose value on individual ice particles developed by  Bateman.
