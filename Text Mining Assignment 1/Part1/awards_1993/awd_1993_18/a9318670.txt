Abstract    :
              9318670  Murhammer  This project is to study the effects of suspension cultures
              on  the growth and product formation of insect cell/baculovirus  expression
              systems.  Many insect cell lines that are not easily  adapted to suspension
              growth have significantly higher product  expression levels than cell lines
              that are easily adapted to  suspension growth.  This phenomenon is to be
              investigated by: (1)  determining the effect of suspension cultures on
              uninfected  insect cells; (2) investigating the genetic basis of suspension 
              growth; and (3) determining the effect of suspension cultures on  the viral
              infection process.  The results of this project are to  provide information
              necessary for the improvement of insect cell  culture scale-up in which the
              yields of recombinant proteins and  viral insecticides are maximized.  ***
