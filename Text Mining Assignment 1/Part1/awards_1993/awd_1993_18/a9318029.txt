Abstract    :
              9318029  Cadoff, E   The Robert Wood Johnson Medical School requests support
              from NSF  for connection of their campus network and affiliates' networks  to
              GES (JVNCnet). GES is the midlevel network located in the New  Jersey.  It will
              provide operations management and information  services and it will give The
              Robert Wood Johnson Medical School,  St. Peter's Medical School, and The Cancer
              Institute of New  Jersey a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the
              NSFNET, a  high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits pep second) National Backbone 
              network.    The Schools need greater functionality and network speed to be 
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
