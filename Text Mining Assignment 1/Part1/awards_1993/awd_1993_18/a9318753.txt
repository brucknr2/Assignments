Abstract    :
              9318753  Yokota    This project investigates the regulation of the reptilian
              kidney  by neural and hormonal mechanisms, and uses the snake kidney as a 
              model for the development and application of methods to assess  vertebrate
              renal function in fine detail, in time and space. The  ophidian kidney allows
              the analysis of renal function at whole  animal, isolated organ and individual
              functional unit (nephron)  levels, and because of its unique morphology permits
              the  simultaneous application of several microtechniques which provide 
              unprecedented resolution of function of filtering units of the  kidney, the
              glomeruli. Using videomicroscopic and micropuncture  methods the blood flow in
              single glomerular microvessels, which  supply the glomeruli, and glomerular
              capillary blood pressures  can be measured continuously. These measurements
              allow  us to  define the state of glomerular function and the mechanisms for 
              modulation of  glomerular functional by neural and hormonal  factors. Studies
              on whole kidney function will define the  functional range for the control of
              renal function by vasoactive  hormones. And studies on intact animals will
              define the  physiological range of endogenous neural and hormonal effectors  in
              controlling  normal renal function and in  regulating  responses to changes in
              physiological state. Integration of these  studies will provide a more detailed
              picture of vertebrate renal  regulation than has been heretofore possible and
              may serve to  illuminate general principles for the regulation of renal 
              function for all vertebrate kidneys.  ***
