Abstract    :
              9318151  Cassel  An alliance of physicists and computer scientists will take on
              the Grand Challenge task of developing a fault-tolerant, wide-area, distributed
              computing and database system for use in high energy physics.  The results of
              this research will also be applicable to many other HPCC applications requiring
              intensive and long-running computations and massive data samples which force
              data to be acquired and distributed over many sites.  The project involves
              Cornell, the University of Florida, the University of California at San Diego
              and the University of Texas at Austin.
