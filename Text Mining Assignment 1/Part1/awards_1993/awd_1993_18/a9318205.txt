Abstract    :
              9318205  Lewis  Studies of salt marshes, seagrass communities, and flood plains
              have shown that the consumer food webs of aquatic ecosystems may be strongly
              dependent on production of unicellular algae, even when organic matter from
              vascular plants is abundant.  These findings suggest that the relative
              importance of unicellular algae in supporting consumer biomass in running
              waters, which are often dominated by organic matter from vascular plants, may
              have been underestimated.  The proposal outlines a plan for testing this
              concept over a broad gradient of physical conditions in two rivers of the
              Colorado Rockies.  The study plan is based on the application of stable isotope
              mentodology, which has been shown by means of pilot studies on the proposed
              field sites to provide good discrimination between vascular plant carbon and
              algal-derived carbon.  The working hypotheses is that the overall contribution
              of algal carbon to secondary production is high whenever physical conditions
              permit sufficient irradiance at the substrate to support algal growth.  The
              drainage basins, and includes corollary measurements of secondary production so
              that relative contributions of algal carbon to consumer production can be
              quantified.  The study will clarify the relative importance of algal carbon
              over a wide range of physical conditions in the presence of organic carbon
              derived from vascular plants.
