Abstract    :
              9318847  Gildea                                    ABSTRACT         The Cariban
              languages spoken in northern Brazil are among  the least documented in the
              world, and many are in danger of  extinction.  This project will collect
              documentary recordings of  as many northern Brazilian Cariban languages as
              possible and  begin the process of transcribing word lists and grammatical 
              information from these recordings.  The project will also provide  support for
              the Brazilian Cariban linguistics students to do  intensive field work in three
              different northern Brazilian  Cariban language communities.  The linguists will
              use traditional  field techniques, including recording, transcribing, and 
              translating word lists and tests; syntactic analysis will be via  elicitation
              and analysis of transcribed texts.  For these three  languages, the project
              will produce analyses of phonology,  morphology, basic syntax, and papers on
              theoretically or  typologically relevant issues.  With these new data, the
              principal investigator will work towards a more reliable classification of the
              Cariban family and reconstruction of Proto Cariban lexicon and  morphosyntax.  
               This project is a collaborative effort, designed to help train  new Brazilian
              linguists in basic linguistic description and 
              historical/typological/functional approaches to linguistics.  It  will also be
              responsive to the needs of Cariban language  communities, offering help in
              preserving their unique languages  and cultures.
