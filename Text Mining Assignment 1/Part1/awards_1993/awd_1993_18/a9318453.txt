Abstract    :
              9318453  CALDWELL    Oregon State University's College of Ocean and Atmospheric
              Science  requests continued support for a mentoring and research- 
              participation program for Native American undergraduate students.  The
              long-term goal of this program is to increase the number of  American Indian
              and Native Alaskan undergraduates who complete  degrees in science, continue to
              graduate school, and enter the  professional scientific work force.  This goal
              will be achieved by  providing the financial support and mentoring necessary
              for these  students to continue their higher education, and by widening their 
              career choices through meaningful and active participation in  on-going
              research projects at OSU during the regular academic year  and in the summer. 
              This research experience will 1) educated them  in the science and 2) overcome
              cultural barriers to career  possibilities.
