Abstract    :
              9318515  Lowman    This grant helps support a symposium on the ecology,
              biodiversity, and conservation of forest-canopy biota, to be held at the Marie
              Selby Botanical Gardens in Sarasota, FL.  Leading scientists from many
              disciplines and countries have been invited to participate.  Forest canopies
              are well recognized sites of biodiversity, yet very little is recognized about
              their biota and ecology.  Intact forest canopies are disappearing rapidly on a
              global scale, often before even the rudiments of their biology are understood. 
              Canopy research has experienced many methodological breakthroughs in the past
              two decades, and this symposium will bring together active researchers to
              exchange ideas on research results, methods, goals, and priorities.  %%%  This
              symposium will improve the abilities of participating scientists to conduct
              canopy research.  Results from canopy research can be applied to forest
              management and conservation biology.    ***
