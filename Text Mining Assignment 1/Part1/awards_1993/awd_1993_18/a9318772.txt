Abstract    :
              9318772  Stoecker  Flagellated microalgae that exist in brine pools within land-
               fast sea-ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, will be investigated.   The
              research focuses on the growth and life history of the  dominant cysts-forming
              brine microalgae.  Oceanographers  envisioned that cysts of brine microalgae
              may be important  paleoenvironmental indicators of past global climates.  Dr. 
              Stoecker plans both field and laboratory experiments to evaluate  the
              physiological growth responses of flagellated microalgae and  cyst formation to
              changes in temperature, salinity, inorganic  nutrients and irradiance.  The
              presence of brine microalgal cysts  from sea-ice will also be assessed in the
              water column and  sediments under annual sea-ice.  This research will provide 
              significant biological information on the interaction of brine  microalgae in
              land-fast ice and underlying marine sediments.  ***
