Abstract    :
              9318799  Boyer       This project connects Pierce College to NSFNET through the 
              Communication Technology Center over a 56 kbps line.  Faculty and  students
              will benefit from access to the resources of the Internet,  including libraries
              and supercomputers.  In addition, they will be  able to communicate and
              collaborate with colleagues at other  institutions in pursuit of research and
              educational projects.  The  award provides partial support of the project for
              two years.
