Abstract    :
              9318904  Lafferty  Piedmont Community College requests support from NSF for 
              connection of its campus network to VERnet.  VERnet is the  midlevel network
              located in the state of Virginia. VERnet will  provide operations management
              and information services and it  will give Piedmont Community College
              connection to the NSFNET, a  high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
              National Backbone  network.  The College needs greater functionality and
              network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
              transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. 
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a
              unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.
