Abstract    :
              9318898  Lettenmaier    This proposal is a collaborative effort between Dr.
              Ann-Henderson-  Sellers (Macquarie University), Dr. Dennis P. Lettenmaier 
              (University of Washington), and Dr. Eric F. Wood (Princeton  University) The
              goal is to determine the relative performance of  land surface hydrology
              representations in general circulation  models (GCMs) used for climate
              simulation and numerical weather  prediction in terms of their ability to
              characterize energy fluxes  at the land surface and the surface water budget. 
              The proposal has  three primary objectives: 1) to evaluate the ability of
              selected  landsurface hydrology models to reproduce measured surface energy 
              and water fluxes using data from a range of spatial scales;  2) To  determine
              how best to combine and extend surface observations,  remote sensing,
              meteorological analyses to validate land surface  parameterizations GCMs; 3) To
              evaluate the ability of selected land  surface hydrology models used in GCMs to
              predict land surface  fluxes of water and energy at the scale of global
              atmospheric  models.  A suite of models would be evaluated on a hierarchy of 
              validation schemes.  The models are 1) the variable infiltration  capacity
              (VIC) model developed by Wood, Lettenmaier, and  colleagues; 2) SECHIBA, the
              land surface model of the LMD (CNRS,  Paris) GCM; 3) The ECMWF land surface
              parameterization; 4) a  simplified version of SiB; and 5) BATS.  The validation
              sites and  data sets will be:  1) FIFE, a 225 Km2 region of native grassland 
              in the central U.S., and 2) A portion of the Arkansas River basin  which
              includes  at least part of DOE's ARM (Atmospheric Radiation  Monitoring)
              Southern Great Plains CART site.  A major focus will be  to use satellite
              remotely sensed measurements of land surface  fluxes and surface measurements
              to obtain large-area validation  data for evapotranspiration and surface soil
              moisture.   ***
