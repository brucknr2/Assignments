Abstract    :
              HARRISON  9318472       National Populations (including human populations) often
               contain large amounts variation at genes coding for soluble  enzymes.  The
              functional significance of this enzyme variation  remains a matter of
              considerable debate.  Do enzyme variants in  natural populations differ in
              their functional properties?  If so,  what forces maintain variation within
              populations.       This project focuses on using DNA sequencing of different 
              allelic forms of the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) to  determine what
              is acting to maintain enzyme variation within  species of insects.  PGI
              occupies a central position in  carbohydrate metabolism.  Catalyzing the
              interconversion of  glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.  The first
              goal of  this research is to characterize the structure of the Pgi gene in  two
              species of crickets, which are both variable for PGI and which  have the "same"
              array of allelic variants (allozymes).   Representatives of each of the allelic
              variants in the two species  will then be sequenced.  Of particular interest is
              whether some or  all of the amino acid differences that distinguish the
              allozyme  classes are identical in the two species and whether observed amino 
              acid differences are likely maintained in populations by balancing  selection. 
              The results will shed light on the general question of  the significance of
              genetic variation for soluble enzymes.   Resolution of this issue has
              implications for understanding the  significance of genetic variation in human
              populations and for  questions related to long-term conservation of genetic
              resources.
