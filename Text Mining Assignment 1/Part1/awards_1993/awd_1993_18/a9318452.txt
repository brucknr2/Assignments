Abstract    :
              9318452  Vanni   This research seeks to understand how detritivorous fish affect
              lake phytoplankton communities by acting as "nutrient pumps." By feeding on
              benthic detritus and excreting nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) into the
              limnetic habitat, these fish effectively pump nutrients from benthic to
              limnetic habitats, where nutrients can stimulate phytoplankton growth and alter
              phytoplankton community structure. Animals can affect communities in many ways
              and it is well known that in northern lakes fish can have strong effects on
              phytoplankton communities through food chain interactions. It is proposed here
              that in warm-water lakes and reservoirs, fish affect phytoplankton primarily
              through the nutrient pump mechanism rather than through conventional food chain
              interactions. The specific objectives are to quantify the community level
              effects of detritivorous fish on lake phytoplankton communities. Hypotheses to
              be tested include: 1) detritivorous fish affect phytoplankton via the nutrient
              pump mechanism, 2) the effects of the nutrient pump mechanism is dependent on
              fish population structure, and detrital nutrient content, and 3) detritivorous
              fish are a major source of nutrients to phytoplankton in small reservoirs
              during times with stream inflows are low. These hypotheses will be tested using
              a series of empirical observations, field and laboratory experiments.  %%% 
              This research will advance our knowledge of food web regulation, top down
              versus bottom up controls on communities, and benthic-limnetic coupling.
              Although this project focuses on community effects, it integrates levels of
              organization from individual to ecosystem. In addition, because nutrient pumps
              may have effects on the frequency and intensity of nuisance blooms of
              blue-green algae, the research has implications for water quality management.
