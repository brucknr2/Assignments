Abstract    :
                      9318848  Li  The project consists on providing financial assistance for
              5  leading American specialists in the mechanics and technology of  brittle
              matrix composites for their participation at the next  International Brittle
              Matrix Composites (BMC) Symposium in Poland,  September 13-15, 1994.  The
              participation of a representative group  of American specialists will
              considerably enhance the role of the  Symposium BMC, and stimulate
              international cooperation.  It will  also benefit the American research
              community in keeping abreast of  European research and development in ceramic
              and cementitious  composites, and their manufacturing and industrial
              applications.   Research reports coming from the European community (EC) joint 
              projects such as those supported under the BRITE and EUREKA  programs, will be
              presented.
