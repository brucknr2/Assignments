Abstract    :
              9318447  Rivin    Dr. Rivin has isolated a maize mutant, termed, dks8 
              (defective kernel shootless-Mu8), that disrupts the early  establishment of a
              functional shoot meristem, but does not  perturb the normal morphogenesis and
              differentiation of the  cotyledon and primary root. These features are unique
              among  the embryo mutants of maize, and they indicate that the gene  identified
              by the dks8 mutation is required for a  fundamental step in the formation of
              the embryonic shoot. By  examining the role of this gene during embryonic 
              development, determining if it plays part in post-embryonic  development, and
              identifying its sequence and product, one  of the cellular processes critical
              to plant development may  be defined. The research program has the following 
              objectives: 1) Identify other alleles of dks8 from existing  mutant collections
              and by targeted mutagenesis using EMS-  mutagenized and Mutator transposon
              stocks. 2) Clone and map  the Dks8 gene using the Mutator transposon tag. The
              dks8  mutation appears to have been caused by the insertion of a  Mu8 element
              of the Robertson's Mutator transposable system.  The sequences flanking this
              element will be cloned and used  to map the dks8 locus. They will be analyzed
              to discover the  product of this developmentally important gene. 3) Determine 
              how and when the dks8 mutation prevents embryonic shoot  development.
              Histological and molecular criteria will be  used to test whether the shoot
              apical meristem cell  population is initiated and maintained in the first
              stages  of embryogenesis in dks8 mutants. Somatic embryogenesis and 
              manipulation of endosperm genotype will be used to examine  whether dks8 gene
              action is intrinsic to the developing  embryo or whether it acts as part of the
              larger ovule or  seed environment. 4) Determine it the Dks8 gene product is 
              required outside of  embryogenesis for the specification or  function of the
              shoot apical meristem. Clonal analysis of  cell lineage will be used to
              determine the effect of the  dks8 genotyp e on the developmental fate of cells
              in an  established shoot apical meristem.    ***
