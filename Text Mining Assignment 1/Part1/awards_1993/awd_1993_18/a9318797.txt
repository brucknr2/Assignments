Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              and the  Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program (IID) will assist
              the Department of  Chemistry at the University of Utah in the purchase of an
              upgrade of its existing 500 MHZ  NMR.  This equipment upgrade will enhance
              research in a number  of areas including the  following:                   
              Conformational Properties of Phorphorus-Containing Six-Membered Rings          
                       Molecular Structure from Automated Interpretation of INADEQUATE
              Spectra                    Segmental Motion in Peptides and Proteins           
                      Mechanistic Studies of Enzymes in the Isoprene Biosynthetic Pathway    
                             Structural Studies of Peptide Neurotoxins from Fish-Hunting Cone
              Snails        Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to  the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules.  It is used to identify  unknown  substances, charcterize
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to  study the  dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art  NMR 
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. 
              The  results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
              catalysis, and in  biology.
