Abstract    :
                    9318926  FLANDERS  The  proposed  research will look at the management of 
              protected  natural  areas  under  continuing  human  use  of  their  natural 
              resources.  The central question will be whether local  community  use  and 
              knowledge reduces uncertainty in managing for ecosystem  reproducibility  and 
              landscape  diversity.  The  research   also  addresses  the  questions  of
              whether  it  is  possible  to  have  continuing  human use of resources and
              still protect the  ecology  of  protected areas, and how different management
              systems  affect  the  successful  integration  of human  activities  into 
              natural  systems.  The  research  will  develop  quantitative  ecosystem 
              management  models  for  national  parks which incorporate  information  from 
              local  and  traditional  users.  Studies  will  be  conducted  on  national
              park units in Alaska, Newfoundland and Finnish Lappland.  This  project  will
              take a systems approach to  the  analysis  of  human/environment interactions
              in Arctic regions of relevance  to  global change research.  ***
