Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              will assist  the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University   in the
              purchase of a tunable IR laser  source.  This equipment will be   used in the
              following areas of research:  (1)  The Diode  Probe Laser   Technique; (2)  Hot
              Atom Excitation of Polyatomic Vibrational States; (3)     Diode Laser Probing
              of Collisions between High Energy and NO2 and   Carbon Dioxide; (4)  Kinematic
              Control of Reaction Dynamics; (5)  Mapping   the Reaction Coordinate in 
              Multichannel Polyatomic Reactions; (6)   Mapping the Reaction Coordinate in
              Polyatomic  Reactions; (7)    Multiphoton IR excitation.        A tunable
              infrared laser can provide important information about chemical   reactivity. 
              Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the   properties of
              reactive and nonreactive of molecules.
