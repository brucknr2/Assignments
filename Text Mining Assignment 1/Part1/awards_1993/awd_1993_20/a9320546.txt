Abstract    :
              9320546  Kiyotaki  One of the major features of the business cycle is the large,
               persistent, and correlated fluctuations of aggregate output,  amount of credit
              and asset prices.  This project will study  theoretically how credit
              constraints interact with aggregate  economic activity over the business cycle.
               In particular, for an  economy where credit limits are endogenously determined
              the  research will focus how relatively small, temporary shocks to  technology
              or income generate large, persistent fluctuations in  output and asset prices. 
              Also, it is asked how shocks to a  particular sector of the economy can
              transmit to the other  sectors so that output and the amount of credit of
              different  sectors move together.  A dynamic general-equilibrium model of an 
              economy is developed in which credit constraints arise naturally  because
              lenders cannot force borrowers to repay debts unless  debts are secured.  The
              dynamic interaction between credit limits  and asset prices is expected to be a
              powerful transmission  mechanism by which the effects of shock persist,
              amplify, and  spill over to the other sectors.  This research is important 
              because it will not only provide for a better understanding of  the propagation
              mechanism of cycles through the credit system,  but will also provide a useful
              framework for the empirical  studies on business and residential investment and
              credit  constraints.  ***
