Abstract    :
              9320126  MILLER       The proposed research address two major issues: (1) the 
              relationships between spatial search and locational factors  such as
              accessibility and (2) the effect of these  relationships on market area
              structure. Both of these issues  are fundamental to location theory. The
              project will develop  probabilistic simulation models run on a supercomputer.
              The  use of simulation models for this research provides the  potential to
              include more realistic assumptions into  location theory. In the first phase of
              the research the  analysis will focus on the interactions between spatial 
              search and spatial competition for the controlled case of  the single searcher
              confronted with competing retail  facilities. In the second phase retail stores
              will compete  for a spatially dispersed, multiple customer base. Of  particular
              interest is the effect of spatial search on the  structure of market areas.
              Existing results in the  literature suggest that search behavior can have
              complex,  and unexpected, influences on facility patronage patterns.       This
              research will have a significant impact on  location theory through its novel
              approach to integrating  models of search and competition. Although the
              immediate  impact of this research is on location theory, it should  also
              provide guidance for the types of questions and the  techniques used for the
              empirical analysis of spatial search  behavior.
