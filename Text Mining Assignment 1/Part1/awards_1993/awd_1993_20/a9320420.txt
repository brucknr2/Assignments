Abstract    :
              9320420  Bhattacharya     This award is for the purchase of eight workstations
              and one multiprocessor workstation to act as a server, all to be connected by a
              communication network.  This cluster of workstations will be dedicated to
              support several research projects, including: (1) distributed test generation
              and simulation for digital VLSI and ULSI circuits, (2) distributed algorithms
              for MCM (multichip module) design and test, (3) distributed ATPG and simulation
              algorithms for mixed-signal and analog circuits, and (4) high-level
              optimization tools for interactive architectural support.  The underlying task
              in each of these four projects will be to develop efficient parallel algorithms
              for various graph problems such as tree search, bipartite matching,
              single-source shortest-paths and minimum-cost flow.  The research will provide
              extensive empirical evaluation of parallel algorithms for graph problems.      
               In addition to exploring parallelism in fundamental computer science problems,
              the proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on current
              design and test methods for digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits. 
              Specifically, the research will alleviate the confinement of these methods to
              uniprocessor machines.  Moreover, by focusing on distributed processing and
              networked workstations, the research efforts will lead to techniques that are
              fully compatible with the existing computing environment of most commercial and
              academic establishments.  ***
