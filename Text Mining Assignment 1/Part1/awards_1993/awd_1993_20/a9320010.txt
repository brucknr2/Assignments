Abstract    :
              9320010  Williams  The focus of this research is the develpoment of efficient, 
              selective and practical methodolgy to construct alpha-amino  acids in optically
              pure form, especially unsymmetrically  substituted beta,beta-disubstituted and
              alkynyl amino acids.  Efforts will be devoted to both methodology and total
              synthesis  of complex amino acid-containing natural products. The main  classes
              of methodology will include: 1) the Diels-Alder  cycloaddition reactions to
              dehydroglycinates; 2)  3+2   azomethine ylide and  2+2  photocycloadditions to 
              dehydroglycinates; and 3) aza-cyclopropylvinyl rearrangements  and trapping.
              The total synthesis of the glycopeptide  vancomycin will be completed. In
              addition, aldol strategies to  access the congested hydroxy amino acid
              antibiotics altemicidin  and paraherquamide A wiil be pursued.  %%%  With this
              award the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the  research of Dr. Robert
              M. Williams of the Department of  Chemistry at the Colorado State University.
              Professor Williams  will focus his work in the area of developing efficient, 
              selective and practical methodology to construct unusual amino  acids in
              optically pure form amd to demonstrate the utility of  these methods by
              synthesizing several complex amino  acid-containing natural products.
