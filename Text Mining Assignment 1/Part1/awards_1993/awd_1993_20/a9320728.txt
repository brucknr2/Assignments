Abstract    :
                9320728  Engel  This research investigates real exchange rate behavior in 
              several industrial countries. The main objective is to get a  better
              understanding of which of the real exchange rate  theories explain the
              movements of relative prices. The study  uses a large data set covering a wide
              range of goods and  countries. The data take into account transportation costs,
               marketing costs, and industry structure. In the empirical  work, the
              investigator proposes a series of econometric  tests that would allow him to
              examine whether his earlier  findings, that the variability of the relative
              prices of  some goods across countries is larger than the variability  of
              relative prices within a country, holds when the  additional factors alluded to
              above are taken into account.  The results from the project are of considerable
              interest  because they will provide a valuable contribution to the  empirical
              real exchange rate literature. Also, the results  may have ramifications for
              how relative price behavior is  expected to change under European and North
              American market  integration.  ***
