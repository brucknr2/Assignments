Abstract    :
              9320353  Topka         The purpose of this research project is to discover more
              about  the contribution that small magnetic elements on the surface of the  Sun
              make to solar luminosity variations.  The basic data are high  resolution
              digital images of the solar photosphere coupled with  simultaneous and
              registered digital magnetograms.  These are  obtained with the ultra-narrowband
              tunable filter imaging system  which has been developed for the Solar Optical
              Universal  Polarimeter, the Coordinated Instrument Package for the Orbiting 
              Solar Laboratory, and by Lockheed Independent Research Funds.   Preliminary
              research has been performed; large amounts of data  analysis and display
              software are in place.
