Abstract    :
                9320221  Forgacs    Funds are requested for travel support for the U.S. 
              participants to the Les Houches Winter School (workshop) on  "Interplay of
              Genetic and Physical Processes in the  Development of Biological Form" to be
              held  from February 20-  26, 1994 at Les Houches, France. The aim  is to
              attempt to  bridge the gap between the disciplines of biology, chemistry  and
              physics in a particular field: the development of  biological form. Chemists
              and physicists will be brought  together will cellular and developmental
              biologists to  discuss the relative importance of genetic and physical 
              processes in development and their possible interactions.  ***
