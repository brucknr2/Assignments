Abstract    :
              9320808  Miller         This is a study of the circumstances under which
              religious  missions resisted the policies of political and economic  interests
              associated with colonialism, and contributed to forces  of democratization in
              colonies of the European powers and other  developing countries.  Data will be
              collected from archives  located in Germany, Norway, Switzerland, England and
              the United  States, and these data will concern missionary work in nations 
              such as Ghana, Cameroon, India and China.  Comparative and  interpretive
              analysis will contrast conflict theories with  Weberian theories of values. 
              Among the hypotheses to be explored  are the possibility that the secular
              effects of the missionary  movement often went beyond the expectations or even
              contrary to  the intentions of the participants.  Another hypothesis is that 
              religious opposition to the political and economic interests to  which the
              missions were symbiotically tied was especially likely  to occur when a
              religious vision of the ideal social structure  was threatened.  %%%       This
              project will contribute to the sociology of religion,  and it will improve our
              general understanding of colonialism and  imperialism.  Extensive religious
              missionary movements exist  today, and this historical study will provide the
              theoretical and  factual basis for understanding their consequences for the 
              developing democracies in the modern world.    ***
