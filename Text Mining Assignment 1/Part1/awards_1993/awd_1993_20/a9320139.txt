Abstract    :
              Cuenod  9320139      This award will support the 1993 activities of the Human
              Frontier Science Program (HFSP),  an international, non-governmental
              organization located in Strasbourg, France and dedicated  to supporting
              international collaborative basic research and long-term (two-year)
              post-doctoral  fellowships in the elucidation of brain functions and molecular
              biology.  The HFSP was  originally proposed by the Government of Japan in 1987
              at the Venice Economic Summit of  the leaders of the major Western countries. 
              The participating countries include Canada,  France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
              Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the  European
              Community.  In 1993 the HFSP awarded 42 research grants and 152 two-year, 
              post-doctoral fellowships.  Sixteen grants and fifteen post-doctoral
              fellowships were awarded  to American researchers.  In addition, 95 fellowships
              were awarded to foreign post-docs who  expressed the intention to conduct their
              research in the United States.  The U.S. contribution  of $3.5 million includes
              funds provided by the National Science Foundation, the National  Institutes of
              Health, the Department of Energy, and the National Aeronautics and Space 
              Administration.
