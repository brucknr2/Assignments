Abstract    :
              9320937  Loehman  This project is supported under the Career Advancement Award
              for  Women Program.  The grant will enable the investigator to work  with a
              leading scholar at the University of Arizona to learn the  techniques of
              experimental economics.  In addition she will begin  to apply these techniques
              in public goods situations.  The goal  of this research is too design and
              compare alternative cost  sharing mechanisms for public goods.  The tool of
              experimental  economics will be used to compare alternative mechanisms in terms
               of social costs and equity for environments with varying group  size, cost
              conditions, and initial endowments.  This project will  provide a case in which
              experimentation is used not only for  behavior hypothesis testing but also as
              method of endogenous  institutional choice.  The object is to design rules and 
              institutions for cooperative solutions to local public problems.  ***
