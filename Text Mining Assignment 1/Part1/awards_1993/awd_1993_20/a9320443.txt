Abstract    :
              IBN 93-20443    Martins    Abstract    A symposium on "Phylogenies and the
              Comparative Method in Animal Behavior" will  be held at the annual meeting of
              the Animal Behavior Society in Seattle,  Washington.  The comparative method
              has been an important component of research  in animal behavior since the
              inception of the field.  In sub-fields ranging  from classical ethology to
              comparative psychology to behavioral ecology,  behavioral researchers rely on
              comparisons among species to infer evolutionary  patterns and universal trends
              in animal behavior.  In the last few decades, a  huge resurgence of interest in
              comparative studies has occurred in evolutionary  biology and systematics,
              focusing primarily on the importance of incorporating  phylogenetic information
              into the design and analysis of comparative studies.  The main goal of this
              symposium is to promote discussion of the impact of the  new concepts and
              techniques that have arisen in this area on the field of  animal behavior.
