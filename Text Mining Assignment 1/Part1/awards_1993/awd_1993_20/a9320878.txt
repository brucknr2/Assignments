Abstract    :
              9320878  Mahon    This research investigation engages ideas about taxation and 
              state formation, in seeking to account for the pattern of tax  reform and
              nonreform across Latin America since the onset of the  debt crisis in 1982. 
              The debt crisis, because it called for a  large private-to-public transfer of
              resources in order to fund  increased debt service, directly or indirectly
              spurred fiscal  changes.  Yet, not all countries reformed taxes substantially
              in  this context, and those that reformed did not do so in the same  way or
              with the same results.  This study will explore hypotheses  relating the degree
              and nature of tax reform to international  capital mobility, to a country's
              experience of economic crisis,  to international influences, and to the
              electoral cycle.    The investigator will retrieve relevant data in library
              research  at William College, Yale University, the International Monetary  Fund
              (IMF), and the Library of Congress.  This will be  supplemented by interviews
              with tax experts at the IMF and  elsewhere.  The data will include measures of
              tax revenue as a  proportion of Gross Domestic Product; the stock of overseas 
              capital held by residents, as a proportion of gross fixed capital  formation;
              level of investment; inflation; GDP growth; and  information about formal
              communications with international  financial institutions.  The research
              involves two pooled time-  series designs, one with thirteen countries and the
              other with  seven, both over the fifteen year period, 1977-1991.    This
              research is especially relevant today, as Latin American  governments face a
              potentially sharp conflict between dealing  with worsening social problems and
              winning the confidence of  international investors.  Tax reform may be one way
              to moderate  this conflict.  This investigation will deepen our understanding 
              of this aspect of state competence in Latin America.  ***
