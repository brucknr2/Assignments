Abstract    :
              9320343  Buckland  Animal cell bioprocessing is currently one of  the most
              important areas of research in  biomedical engineering and biotechnology.  
              Until recently, this was one of the least  explored areas of bioprocessing. 
              Recent  advances in the biological and medical  sciences have opened many new
              opportunities  and challenges for cell culture based  manufacturing.  The
              emerging area of tissue  engineering is at a particular exciting stage  of
              development.  In view of the recent rapid  expansion of research and
              development in cell  culturing, a conference entirely devoted to  Cell Culture
              Engineering is timely.  This  conference will contribute to the elucidation  of
              the engineering and scientific principles  of animal cell bioprocessing.
