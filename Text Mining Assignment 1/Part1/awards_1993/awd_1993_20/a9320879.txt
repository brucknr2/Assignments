Abstract    :
                                          Abstract    9320879  Forbes  This project continues
              the study of long-period (>2 day period)  atmospheric planetary waves near the
              antarctic mesopause  (approximately 95 km altitude).  The effort has 2 facets: 
                1.   The principal investigator (P.I.) will continue his analysis       of
              existing radar wind measurements made from Mawson,       Molodezhnaya, and
              Scott Base in Antarctica and comparison with       similar measurements made
              from Fairbanks, AK and Heiss Island,       Russia.    2.   The operation at
              South Pole for one year of a meteor radar to       obtain mesospheric wind data
              set.  The radar unit will be       provided by the P.I.'s Russian
              collaborators, and a Russian       scientist will install and operate the
              instrument.  ***
