Abstract    :
              9320889  Kiefer  The operation of markets and the determination of prices are 
              central issues in economics.  Efficient operation of capital  markets, in
              particular, is crucial to the efficient allocation of  resources.  The stock
              market is key to the allocation of capital  in the U.S. and other developed
              countries.  In the U.S. system,  the market maker, the specialist assigned to a
              particular stock  or group os stocks, is responsible for maintaining the market
              in  those stocks.  The market maker quotes bid and ask prices, and  adjusts
              these in the light of market activity.  The market maker  accumulates
              information by watching the order flow.  The purpose  of this project is to
              develop and estimate a model of the order  flow process and the market makers's
              behavior using trade by  trade data.  In particular the information content of
              trade size  will be measured in order to assess the effects of "cream 
              skimming" in financial markets and the interaction between  liquidity and
              information will be examined.  ***
