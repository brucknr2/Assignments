Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   is
              focused on infrastructure development in analytical chemistry.  This   activity
               provides support for four faculty from undergraduate   institutions to enable
              their participation in research activities at the   University of Tennessee
              during the summer months.  Both new participants,   and visitors who have been
              involved previously will be accommodated in   this program.   It is designed as
              an aggregated NSF Research Opportunity   Award (ROA) and has become known in
              the chemistry community as a   Macro-ROA.  By providing faculty from regional
              undergraduate institutions   with such research opportunities, this program
              serves not only to   maintain or rejuvenate their interest in research
              pursuits, but also to   update them regarding modern analytical chemistry in a
              collegial setting.    The focus of this project is the support of faculty from
              undergraduate   institutions for research and training in analytical chemistry.
                 Experiences garnered by participants in this program are passed on to  
              their students in their respective institutions.  This infrastructure  
              investment serves to maintain topical currency on the part of the  
              participants and to indirectly promote the development of their student's  
              interest in careers in analytical chemistry.
