Abstract    :
              Professor Johna Leddy in the Chemistry Department at the University of   Iowa
              will investigate the properties of microstructured materials based   on ion
              exchange polymers that can create local magnetic or density   gradients on a
              molecular scale.  These materials show great potential for   enabling the
              control of chemical transport based on the magnetic   properties of the
              chemical species. The effect of these materials on the   transport properties
              of various molecules will be characterized using   electrochemical methods.   
              This research activity focuses on the investigation of unique materials   which
              can be engineered on a molecular scale to provide enhanced   transport for a
              variety of chemical species.  The applications of this   technology include
              fuel cells, batteries, micro flux switches,   membrane-based separations, and
              membrane-based sensors.
