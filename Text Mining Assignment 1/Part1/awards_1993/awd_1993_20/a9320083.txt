Abstract    :
              9320083  Gordon    Description:  This project is for a  collaborative research
              by two well known  laboratories: Dr. Milton Gordon's Laboratory,  University of
              Washington, Seattle, and Dr. S.  Riazuddin's Laboratory at the Centre for 
              Advanced Molecular Biology, University of  Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.  The work
              seeks to  develop plant transformation procedures which  will be applied to
              chickpea for the expression  of Bacillus thuringiensis pesticidal proteins 
              possessing entomocidal properties against  American bollworm (Heliothis
              armigera).  The  study will address three main objectives.   Firstly,
              pesticidal genes identified in Bt  isolates from Pakistani environments will be
               cloned in plant expression vectors under the  control of specific promoters. 
              Secondly,  procedures will be developed for the  transformation of chickpea by
              a reporter gene  (GUS) using particle bombardment.  Finally,  these procedures
              will be applied to transform  chickpea with Bt pesticidal genes and the 
              transgenic plant will be examined for level  expression of the transgene and
              insect  resistance.    Scope:  The project will provide fund for a  young
              scientist from Dr. Riazuddin Laboratory  to spend several months at the
              University of  washington to participate with Dr. Gordon in  the experiments
              using facilities not available  in Lahore.  This collaborative research is 
              expected to be quite beneficial to the two  laboratories, and particularly
              useful in the  efforts towards producing isect-resistant  economic crops.
