Abstract    :
              9320043  Hooks         This is a study of the regional stimulus provided by
              federal  outlays and investments, by county, over the period 1954-1990.   It
              will build on existing data concerning World War II federal  investments by
              encoding data contained in General Services  Administration reports on federal
              properties, classified  according to the function performed (research and
              development,  industrial, administrative, and miscellaneous) and by the agency 
              controlling the installation.  Analysis will examine the effects  of these
              facilities on several dimensions of county-level growth:  value added in
              manufacturing, employment, wage levels, and  education level of the work force.
               %%%       In addition to addressing issues of central concern to  social
              scientists, this research will generate valuable  information for the policy
              makers who are making decisions  concerning the redirection of federal
              investments and prime  contracts in the post Cold War era.  Specifically, there
              is  widespread concern that counties in which major military  installations are
              being closed or reduced in size will experience  significant economic
              dislocation in the coming years.   Additionally, there exists much disagreement
              over the possibility  that federally-owned toxic waste sites, especially those
              used for  nuclear weapons production, may inhibit local economic growth.  
              Because the data set will include military bases destined to  close and toxic
              waste sites, the findings generated by this  research can assist policy makers
              to anticipate which counties  will experience the greatest economic
              dislocation.    ***
