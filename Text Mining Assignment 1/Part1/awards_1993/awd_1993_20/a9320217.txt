Abstract    :
              9320217  Andrews  This award is for support for graduate students to attend the 
              annual Arctic Workshop and supports registration, housing and meals  for
              approximately 25 students.  These workshops have been held  since 1972 and
              alternate their location between Boulder, Colorado  and another location, every
              other year.  The workshops will be held  in Boulder in 1994 and 1996 and in
              Laval, Quebec, Canada in 1995.   These workshops provide a vital forum for the
              exchange of ideas and  data within the Arctic research community, at both the
              national and  international level.  ***
