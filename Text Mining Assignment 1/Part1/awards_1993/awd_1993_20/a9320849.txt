Abstract    :
              9320849  Berry    This research investigation develops and tests a model of
              state  welfare policy which stresses the interaction of three groups of 
              participants:  (1) poor individuals who decide whether to  participate in
              welfare; (2) state policy makers who establish  conditions for eligibility and
              set benefit levels for programs  like Aid to Families with Dependent Children
              (AFDC); and, (3)  national policy makers who set general guidelines for state 
              policies.  The model incorporates seven "submodels," each  focusing on a major
              research question from the welfare  literature.    In most cases, the submodels
              involve specifications that reflect  the core logic in support of the submodel
              more accurately than  specifications in the existing literature.  More
              importantly,  while extant literature tends to investigate these models in 
              isolation, this research recognizes that this division of labor  has impeded
              our ability to answer the research questions of  interest by basing conclusions
              on parameter estimates from  grossly underspecified models.  In contrast, this
              research  estimates a more reasonable model reflecting combined causal 
              linkages in all seven submodels.  In effect, their ability to  obtain "good"
              estimates of coefficients in each submodel is  enhanced by statistical controls
              and identifying restrictions  based on the variables and causal linkages in the
              other  submodels.  ***
