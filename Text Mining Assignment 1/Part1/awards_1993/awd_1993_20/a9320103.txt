Abstract    :
              9320103  Sarikaya    The  objective  of this symposium is to explore the 
              present  and  future  ways  of determining physical and chemical properties  of
               complex  nanostructured materials at spatial dimensions at  scale  less  than 
              100  nm.   This  is  accomplished  by  convening   an  international  group of
              experts from widely  different  areas  of  science  into  a  common  platform. 
              The  characterization  means  include  light,  X-rays, and electron imaging, 
              diffraction,  and  spectroscopy techniques, scanning probe microscopies,  and 
              other  techniques  that  probe  the samples at  a  nanometer  scale.   A 
              specific   aspect  of  the  symposium  is  its  multidisciplinary  character
              covering widely differing fields of materials  science,  including  solid state
              physics, chemistry, and biology,  and  its  international   array   of  
              researchers   working   on   metals,  intermetallics,   ceramics,  polymers,  
              composites,   biological  materials, semiconductors, superconductors, and other
              electronic,  magnetic, and optical materials.  %%%  Processing  materials to
              produce nanoscale structures offers  the  possibility  of developing unique
              properties in a wide  range  of  materials.   This  symposium addresses  the 
              characterization  of  these  materials,  which  is  important  to 
              understanding  their  processing, quality and behavior.  ***
