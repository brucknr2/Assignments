Abstract    :
              9320386  Buchinsky  Much recent research in labor economics is devoted to 
              understanding the wage structure of American workers. This  research
              investigates changes in the returns to schooling  and experience for the  male
              and female labor force,  using  a newly developed econometric technique for
              quantile  regression. The technique describes the entire conditional 
              distribution of wages and  also allow an examination of  within-group
              inequality.       The use of the  quantile regression technique raises  serious
              theoretical concerns related to sample selection  bias. In order to handle
              this, the first part of the  proposed project is devoted to the theoretical
              derivation of  the asymptotic properties of the quantile regression  estimator.
              The second part proposes to use nonparametric  methods to investigate changes
              in the female labor force  wage structure. The application uses Census of
              Population  Survey data from 1964 to 1992. The findings from this  empirical
              enquiry would shed light on important issues that  relate to changes in the
              entire conditional distribution of  the female labor force.  The third part of
              the project uses  the results from the second part to investigate educational 
              choices of the female labor force over time. The application  uses data from
              the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics  and the National Longitudinal
              Survey to track individuals  over time.  The findings from the two empirical
              analyses  would help explain mobility of wages and earnings. If wages  are
              immobile, then changes in wage inequality would be  indicative of real welfare
              implications, otherwise  differences among individuals would average out over
              time.  ***
