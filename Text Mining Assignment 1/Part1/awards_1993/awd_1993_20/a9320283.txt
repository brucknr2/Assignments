Abstract    :
              9320283  Steward    Localization of determinants in the oocyte and the early 
              embryo represents a fundamental step in embryonic patterning  in both Xenopus
              and Drosophila.  In both organisms the  localization of determinants is
              achieved through mRNA  targeting.  While several localized RNAs have been 
              identified and studied in Drosophila and in Xenopus, the  mechanisms
              responsible for this localization are largely  unknown.  The Bicaudal-D protein
              plays a role in the  localization of mRNAs during oogenesis.  It appears to be 
              transported from the cystocytes to the pro-oocyte in early  oogenesis.  It may
              function either in the transport or  tethering of RNAs in the oocyte.  Dr.
              Steward proposes  experiments addressing these basic questions:  How does Bic- 
              D function to localize RNAs?  What is the function of the  localized Bic-D RNA,
              and what factors interact with the RNA  localization sequences in the Bic-D RNA
              to achieve its  localization?  ***
