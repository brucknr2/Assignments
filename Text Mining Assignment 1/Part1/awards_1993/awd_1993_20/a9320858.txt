Abstract    :
              9320858  SARAT  This project will convene an international conference of 
              sociolegal scholars to examine the role of the legal profession  in social and
              political processes.  The conference will focus on  the involvement of the
              legal profession, in various countries and  in the international arena, in
              developing a wide variety of  rights claims and other policy goals.  A special
              focus is the  transnational development of human rights claims.  Three 
              questions will be addressed.  First, what parts of the legal  profession engage
              in these activities and why do they seek to use  their legal practice to these
              ends?  Second, what are their  strategies and tactics and how do they differ
              (if at all) from  those of conventional practice?  Third, what are the
              conditions  that facilitate or inhibit the political uses of legal practice?   
               A number of social scientists across the world who have been  studying these
              questions will present the results of their  research at the conference.  These
              papers and the other  proceedings of the conference will be published as a
              book.  ***
