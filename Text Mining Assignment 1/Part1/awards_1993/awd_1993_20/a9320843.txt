Abstract    :
              9320843  Shleifer    Privatization of state enterprises has been one of the most
               important economic changes that the world has seen in the last  two decades. 
              In several dozen countries, including France,  Britain, Italy, the United
              States (Conrail), as well as many  countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin
              America, public enterprises  have been transferred to the private sector.  An
              even more  striking change is privatization in Eastern Europe and Russia, 
              where almost whole economies are being transferred from public to  private
              ownership.  While it is generally believed that private  enterprise operates
              more efficiently than state enterprise, there  is very little work to explain
              why this is so.  For example, is  it the fact that politicians have direct
              control over operating  decisions in public sector firms or is it the fact that
              any  residual cash flow accrues to the Treasury?  This project  investigates
              empirically and theoretically the relative  efficiency of state and private
              enterprises in different  countries depending on such factors as public vs.
              private  ownership of cash flows, political vs. managerial control of  firms,
              levels of political corruption, degree of political  competition and the nature
              of the electoral system, and the  importance of the civil service.    The
              institutional and empirical work focuses on the privatization  process and its
              aftermath in Russia and Eastern Europe with  particular emphasis on Russia. 
              The broad areas of focus are: 1)  trends in the privatization process itself;
              2) the evolution of  ownership structure and corporate governance; and 3) the
              credit  and subsidies to newly privatized vs. public firms.  The project  uses
              firm-level data available through Russian government sources  as well as data
              from a survey conducted by the investigators.
