Abstract    :
              9320929  Galaskiewicz           This   is  a  project  to  study  how 
              not-for-profit  organizations   adapted  to  the  threat  of  organizational 
              decline at the end of the 1980s and early in the 1990s.   It  will  collect a
              fourth wave of interview data from a  sample  of  174 such organizations in the
              Minneapolis-St. Paul area,  organizations which were previously studied in 
              1980,  1984,  and   1988.    Ideas  about  the  importance  of  managerial 
              strategies  in  adapting  to the  threat  of  organizational  decline will be
              systematically tested.           This   project   is  distinctive  in  building
                upon  longitudinal     data    collected    from    not-for-profit 
              organizations, data which in the past have yielded important  insights  into
              organizational performance and behavior.   In  an  era  in  which  responding
              to rapidly changing  external  conditions  and organizational down-sizing are 
              keynotes  of  economic   life,  this  project  will  help   lead   to   an 
              understanding  of the factors and strategies that  influence  organizational
              survival and success.  ***
