Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Greenwald/ATM-9320146         This project will evaluate the
              range of physical processes  leading to the transfer of energy, momentum and
              mass from the solar  wind to the earth's upper atmosphere.  Specifically, the 
              investigators will identify the conditions in the solar wind and  earth's
              magnetosphere that lead to the onset of current surges and  then to track the
              resulting gravity waves in the upper atmosphere  as they propagate
              equatorwards, dissipating their energy.  The  proposal will constitute a
              continuation of a previous three-year  study using high-latitude ground-based
              and satellite  instrumentation for studies of gravity waves launched by
              electrojet  current surges.
