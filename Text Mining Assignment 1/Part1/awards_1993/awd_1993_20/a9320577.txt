Abstract    :
                The problem of determining properties of an unknown  function  by evaluating
              it at scattered points arises in many  different  contexts.  If the function is
              arbitrary, it may be  necessary to evaluate the  function at all points in its 
              domain; however, when the function is  well-behaved, it is  often possible to
              determine global information with  relatively few probes (evaluations).  The
              determination of  zero of a monotonic  function is a classic example of this 
              problem; other examples include finding  the extremum of a  unimodal function,
              the game of Battleship, and geometric  probing in which one wants to find
              various shape parameters  of an object by  probing it at the fewest possible
              points.    This research applies an approach,  based on Kraft's  inequality, to
              such discrete search problems.  Using  generalization of Kraft's inequality to
              prove lower bounds are applicable to  problems in which an algorithm for the 
              problem can be mapped to a computation  tree; Kraft's  inequality then captures
              the minimum ``degree of imbalance''  that  must be present in any computation
              tree solving the  problem.
