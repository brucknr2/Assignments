Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Zirin/9320822         This proposal will provide a new
              instrument, the spectro-  magnetograph, to Big Bear Solar Observatory to
              measure the strength  of quiet Sun magnetic fields as well as weak pores and
              "invisible  spots."  This instrument will also provide a definitive measure of 
              weaker solar fields, emerging flux, the polar fields, and other  features.  The
              PIs will study their extensive data on quiet Sun  magnetic fields to determine
              their formation and evolution, and  continue their joint studies of the
              magnetic features responsible  for X-ray bright points.
