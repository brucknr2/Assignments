Abstract    :
              9320538  Barbari  This proposal is on research to study structure-function 
              relationships for gel impregnated porous membranes.  A polymer  gel is
              covalently fixed inside the pores of a thin  ultrafiltration membrane to form a
              composite membrane.  Membrane  synthesis conditions will be related to flux and
              selectivity for  diffusion of two proteins.  Also, a method to improve
              selectivity  by chemically modifying one surface of the composite will be 
              investigated.  ***
