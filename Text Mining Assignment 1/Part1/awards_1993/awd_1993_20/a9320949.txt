Abstract    :
              9320949  Mills       The purpose of the Agile Manufacturing Research Institute 
              (AMRI) is to develop an understanding of agile manufacturing  enterprise and
              system performance based on quantitative data; to  structure a program of
              research to meet aerospace industry-defined  needs; and to move emerging
              technology which has a potential for  impacting agile manufacturing into the
              next stage of functional  prototyping or proof-of-concept test beds.       The
              AMRI will include the following tasks:  research team  building for the
              specific industry, quantitative analysis, advanced  agile manufacturing
              projects, education, training, dissemination,  and documentation of agile
              manufacturing research results.   Attaining agility in this industry is seen as
              a key to US  manufacturing leadership and global competitiveness.  This AMRI 
              will help provide a solid knowledge base for this transformation.
