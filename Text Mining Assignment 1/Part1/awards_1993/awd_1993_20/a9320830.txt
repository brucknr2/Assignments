Abstract    :
              9320830  Rogers    This research is in the planning stage. It is funded under 
              the Minority Research Planning Grant. The empirical study  seeks to look at the
              effect of changes in the general degree  of wage inequality in The United
              States economy . The basic  question being addressed is whether the sources of
              the black  white male earnings gap different in different segments of  the
              distribution. The plan is to look for a widening wage  gap across racial groups
              by disaggregating the data into  finer categories, for example, within
              metropolitan  areas,  within industry-education cells, within
              industry-occupation  cells, etc. in an attempt to explain the sources of these 
              differences, or reconcile the several explanations that are  currently offered
              in the literature.  ***
