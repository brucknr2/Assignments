Abstract    :
              9320504  Barro    This research will focus on the key economic issue of the 
              determinants of long-run economic growth.  The work will include  theoretical
              models, empirical estimation and testing of theories,  and the construction and
              distribution of related data sets.    One data set contains panel data for 138
              countries over the  period 1960 to 1990.  A major element of this set is
              information  on educational attainment by level and sex.  Other variables 
              cover national accounts, demographics, political variables,  government
              activities, and foreign trade.  Another data set will  include figures on
              income and migration across the U.S. states  and for regions of the major
              European countries, Japan, and  Canada.  Preliminary results on the growth rate
              of real per-  capita Gross Domestic Product for about 100 countries from 1960 
              to 1985 reveal a "conditional convergence" effect: countries that  begin with
              low per-capita GDP tend to grow faster if one holds  constant measures of
              initial human capital (in the forms of  education and health).  Government
              policies are shown to  influence a country's long-run position.  The results
              indicate  that growth is enhanced by better human capital, reduced market 
              distortions, a greater degree of political stability, and smaller  government
              spending in nonproductive areas.  The propensity to  invest is also positively
              related to growth, but it appears that  much of this relationship reflects the
              reverse impact of growth  on investment, rather than vice versa.  This
              empirical work will  be continued and additional research will be carried out
              on  regional data and on the long-period information that is  available for
              about 30 countries.
