Abstract    :
              9320041  Venkatasubramanian  The proposed research is in the area of dynamic
              theory underlying  the security analysis of large interconnected electric power
               systems.  Among the expected contributions of the proposed research  are the
              resolution of certain modeling issues which arise near  singular surfaces, and
              a practical procedures for finding  homoclinic orbits.  Another objective is
              the development of a  useful theory to deal with the common problem of changes
              in system  dimension as various devices reach hard limits, or in the case of 
              structural changes.  ***
