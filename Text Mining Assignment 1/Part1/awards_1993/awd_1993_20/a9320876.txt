Abstract    :
              9320876  Wohl  The objective of the project is to assess potential hazards 
              associated with catastrophic flooding from glacier lakes in  a portion of the
              Arun River basin in the Nepalese Himalayas.  The work will identify and
              characterize glacial-lake basins  and channels that have been subjected to
              outburst floods.  A  better understanding of the casual relations between basin
               and channel physical characteristics and flooding  occurrences will be
              achieved by using GIS software, remote  sensing imagery and topographic maps,
              as well as fieldwork  of more detailed, on-site characteristics of lake basin 
              (size and volume of lake, seasonal changes of water level,  changes in lake
              size through time, type of dams, their  potential stability, etc.) and outburst
              channel features  (channel cross-sectional and longitudinal morphology, flood 
              erosional and depositional  ***
