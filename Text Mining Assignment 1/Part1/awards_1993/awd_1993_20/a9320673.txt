Abstract    :
              9320673  Thompson    Campaign financing is a prominent issue on the contemporary
               public agenda.  The costs of campaigns are increasing at a rapid  pace and
              reports indicate that political action committees (PACs)  are contributing a
              greater proportion of funds to candidates.   Turnover rates are declining and,
              as a result, the public is  concerned about the influence of "special
              interests" and career  politicians in legislative decision making.    The
              primary purpose of this investigation is to collect state  legislative campaign
              finance data from a large and representative  sample of states.  Data are
              gathered from approximately 25  states, selected in relation to important
              differences in their  political characteristics (degree of partisan competition
              for  legislative seats, degree of legislative professionalism, etc.),  regional
              and cultural differences, electoral system  characteristics, legal requirements
              (campaign finance  restrictions, public funding of elections, etc.), and
              structural  factors (costs of campaigns, size and type of district).   
              Information is collected for approximately 40 potentially  important
              explanatory variables.  These include candidate  characteristics (party, race,
              gender, leadership position, etc.);  electoral variables (primary and general
              election votes in  current and previous elections, etc.); revenue and
              expenditure  variables; and, system characteristics.  Data are collected for 
              the four most recent election cycles - - 1986, 1988, 1990, and  1992.    This
              data set will be the first multi-state, longitudinal (over  four election
              cycles) one available to researchers.  The data  will be archived at the
              Inter-university Consortium for Political  and Social Research where it will be
              available to other  researchers to pursue additional research topics.  ***
