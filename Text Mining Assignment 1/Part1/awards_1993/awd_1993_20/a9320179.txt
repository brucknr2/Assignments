Abstract    :
              9320179  Truszczynski     This award provides funds to purchase and construct a
              high-speed ATM network testbed to support several projects in distributed
              computing, network protocol, 3-D vision and artificial intelligence. Specific
              projects to be studied are:    (1) Distributed Collaborative Systems:
              Communication protocols for distributed real-time multimedia collaborative
              applications such as remote visualization, imaging, and video conferencing will
              be developed in this research project.    (2) Distributed Shared Memory:
              Research will be performed on highly-scalable DSM synchronization and
              consistency algorithms and protocols for designing massive multicomputers with
              a high-speed network serves as the backplane.    (3) Memory-Based File Systems:
              In this project a new file system abstraction based on volatile storage that
              avoids the bottlenecks of disk storage and capitalizes on fast networks and
              distributed memory resources will be investigated.    (4) Active 3-D Vision:
              Investigation on the use of active camera control and distributed processing to
              improve the quality and performance of stereo reconstruction of
              three-dimensional objects will be performed in this research.    (5)
              Distributed Automated Reasoning: Under this project a reasoning system based on
              default logic and extended logic programming and implement it in the
              distributed computing environment will be developed.      These five projects
              tackle several most pressing issues facing current and future distributed
              systems. Approaches to scalable distributed multicomputers and new
              architectures for high-performance distributed file systems studied. In addi
              tion, studies will be made on other important domains of applications such as
              multimedia, active 3-D vision, and automated reasoning --- each of them
              requiring significant computational power and high bandwidth communications.
