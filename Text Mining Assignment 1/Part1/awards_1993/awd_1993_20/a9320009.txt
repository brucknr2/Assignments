Abstract    :
              9320009  MERRY  The boundary between legitimate and illegitimate violence is 
              culturally defined and historically changing.  Through court  cases involving
              domestic violence, the law defines not only what  constitutes criminal violence
              but also what constitutes  appropriate behavior for men and women in intimate
              relationships.   In order to examine the role courts play in reinforcing or 
              challenging cultural meanings about gender and violence, this  project studies
              the changing ways domestic violence cases are  handled in a single local court
              over a period of 140 years.    Data will collected through a detailed study of
              court records and  observation of court officials as they process cases.  Court
               records indicate how domestic violence is described by victims,  justified by
              batterers, and determined to be acceptable or not by  judges over this time
              period.  The ethnographic research will  document how these cases are currently
              being handled and how  court officials, defendants, and victims now think and
              talk about  wife battering.  The location of the study, a small town in the 
              plantation region of Hawai'i, is one which has experienced  American
              colonialism and now has a culturally plural community.
