Abstract    :
              9320663  Bose          This is a project to examine the role of women in  the 
              American  work  force  in 1900.  Data from  the  Public  Use  Microsample  of
              the 1900 Census will be used in  conjunction  with  county-level contextual
              data to examine how the extent  of labor force activity and the occupational
              distribution of  women  at the turn of the century varied by locality, racial 
              and   ethnic  background,  family  composition,  and   other  factors.         
              Studies  of  recent  trends  in  women's  labor  force  participation  and
              occupational distribution  often  involve  claims  about contrasts with the
              "traditional"  patterns  of  the  past.   However, such claims are generally 
              based  upon  misleading  stereotypes  or at best  upon  information  from 
              particular localities or occupations.  The current  project,  by developing a
              representative national data set for 1900 as  well as by examining local
              variations, will make it possible  to  study  long term trends in the labor
              force  activity  of  American women in a much more accurate way.  ***
