Abstract    :
                9320483  Featherman      This workshop, organized by the Social Science
              Research  Council, in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and  the
              African Academy of Sciences, brings together African and  U.S. scientists from
              a range of disciplines to examine the  question: how has human occupancy of
              African landscapes  affected the biodiversity found within those landscapes? 
              Active researchers from the biological sciences, social  sciences, and
              humanities will consider the relevance of this  question and the feasibility of
              pursuing research  initiatives to answer it.   The specific research interests 
              of the participants include agriculture and drought,  forestry, agroforestry,
              and rangelands management.  The  African participants come from 7 different
              countries,  representing a broad cross-section of the continent  (Nigeria,
              Uganda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Namibia, Cameroon,  Kenya).    The role of humans
              in managing and perhaps creating  biodiversity has been neglected so far, and
              Africa, as the  place where humans originated, and where the dynamic effects 
              of those interactions are currently highly visible, is the  logical place to
              begin examining the question.  The workshop  on this novel, important, and
              timely theme will strengthen  collaboration  internationally  (between US and
              African  scientists), regionally (among scientists in different parts  of
              Africa), and across disciplinary boundaries.  ***
