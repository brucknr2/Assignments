Abstract    :
                     9320498  Finney        This project supports the dissertation research of
              a student  from the University of Hawaii, studying resource conservation by  a
              fishing community in the Solomon Islands.  The student is  testing the theory
              that traditional peoples are natural  conservators of their environmental
              resources.  By conducting  participant observation, time allocation analysis
              and economic  and household surveys, the student will test the hypothesis that 
              fishermen stop exploiting particular resource locations when the  yields
              decline to the average yield for the area (thus leaving a  given location or
              "patch" before it is degraded, and so  conserving it).       This project is
              important because it will advance our  understanding of indigenous knowledge in
              tropical marine  environments; it will evaluate the role of territoriality in 
              conserving aquatic resources; and it will contribute to our  understanding of
              human foraging strategies as they relate to  resource management and
              conservation.  This sort of knowledge  will be valuable to add to our
              repertoire of resource  conservation strategies in a world of threatened
              environments.  ***
