Abstract    :
              9320016  Kanade  This award provides partial funding for the sixth International
               Symposium on Robotics Research, to be held in Pittsburgh, PA on  October 2-5,
              1993.  The symposium brings together some of the most  active robotics
              researchers from academia, government, and industry  to examine the state of
              the art and future research directions in  robotics.  A book will be produced
              which contains papers  representing reviews of established research areas as
              well as  papers reporting on new areas.
