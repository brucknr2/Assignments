Abstract    :
                9320236  Beeman    This project supports the dissertation research of a
              student  in cultural anthropology from Brown university, studying the 
              relationship between dominant national symbols and regional  variations in the
              popular culture of performances in Spain.  The student, an ex-professional
              dancer, will conduct  participant observation among flamenco students in a
              school  in Madrid, and also in Seville, the traditional home of  regional
              flamenco as performed by Spanish Gypsies.  Using  formal interviews and group
              interviews (focus groups) as  well as examination of news media the student
              will study  perfmroance traditions as potent symbols of Spanish culture  as
              well as the tension between regional and central forces  in national culture.  
               This research is important because nations often choose  symbols of nationhood
              -- flags, dances and other  performances and works of art -- which are used by
              the  central government as symbols of the whole.   These symbols  are at the
              same time instituted and performed in regional  variations in opposition to the
              dominance of the center.  When civil order breaks down (as we see it happening
              in the  former Yugoslavia) these symbols can become targets and  rallying
              points.  Understanding through a careful case study  how one traditional
              national symbol is learned and  interpreted by people with varying agendas can
              help us  understand the general processes of symbol formation and  exploitation
              in modern nations, which can help us understand  how to deal with regional and
              inter-ethnic problems.
