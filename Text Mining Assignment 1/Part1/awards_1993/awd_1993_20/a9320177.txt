Abstract    :
              9320177  Thompson     This award provides funds to purchase Coordinate Measuring
              Machine (CMM) accessories which will be dedicated to support research in
              computer and information science and engineering.  Specific items include a
              tool rack to allow automatic exchange of probes without recalibration, a rotary
              table to allow part repositioning under CIMS software control without
              recalibration, and the CIMS software upgrade needed to operate each of these.  
                The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
              particular:  Sensing strategies and tactics for the validation and reverse
              engineering of manufactured parts, emphasizing the detection and recognition of
              complex manufacturing features; automated feature-based inspection of
              manufacturing operations; and representations for tolerance specification which
              unify design, manufacturing, and measurement.     For each of these projects,
              experimentation requires the ability to acquire accurate three-dimensional data
              about real objects.  The requested equipment will allow the CMM currently
              installed in the laboratory to make measurements of objects with more complex
              shape than is currently possible and to do so in a more autonomous manner than
              it can now accomplish.  In addition, the rotary table will significantly
              enhance the utility of a 3-D range camera to position objects to increase the
              accuracy of range sensing and acquire multiple calibrated views of the same
              object from different viewpoints.  ***            TERMINALHLP           @ j
