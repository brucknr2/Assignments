Abstract    :
                  9320717  McCoy  The research to be performed under this SGER grant will
              further  develop, and make known to the research community, a new  mathematical
              framework for accommodating the wide range of length  scales for observing
              material heterogeneity.  The PI will carry out  research employing the newly
              developed Theory of Multiresolution  Decomposition, which is based on the use
              of discrete orthogonal  wavelets.  This approach will be applied at the
              interface of  mechanics and of materials science through the "Theory of Phase- 
              Space Substructuring" that allows for the rigorous investigation of  the
              physics of across-scale coupling... an issue which is central  to the
              application of mechanics to materials science.  By  application of this new
              methodology, a class of problems which,  hitherto, was inaccessible (namely,
              that category of phenomena in  which different stochastic processes are
              operative on different  length scales) now becomes amenable to rigorous
              analysis.  This  type of problem is typically encountered in investigations
              which  have as their goal an understanding of how the macro properties of 
              materials depend on their microstructure.  ***
