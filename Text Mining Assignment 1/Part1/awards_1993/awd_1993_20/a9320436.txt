Abstract    :
              9320436  Jain     Improved computational methods and information management
              tools are critical in order to enhance the national competitive edge across
              broad sectors of the economy and to make rapid progress in education, medicine,
              global change analysis and several other aspects of scientific endeavor.  Until
              recently, information in computers was almost always in alpha-numeric form, but
              today, alpha-numeric information seems very restricting in our interactions
              with computers.  We need multimedia systems that will seamlessly manage audio,
              video, graphics, alpha-numeric and several other forms of information. To meet
              these new demands, many aspects of multimedia computing are being addressed by
              researchers at the University of California, San Diego.       This award
              provides equipment to support active research projects in the emerging areas of
              multimedia computing in the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering,
              and Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San
              Diego. The massive storage equipment will be used for several research projects
              covering many important areas of multimedia computing: multimedia servers,
              networking, operating systems, and databases. This equipment will also
              facilitate joint research projects in distributed multimedia information
              systems. The massive storage will help to take some of the algorithms and
              studies to the level of realistic prototypes.  In addition, the equipment will
              also be available to other researchers developing multimedia tools in robotics,
              artificial intelligence, health care, manufacturing and other related areas.
