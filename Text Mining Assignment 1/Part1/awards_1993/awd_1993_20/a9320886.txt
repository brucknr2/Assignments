Abstract    :
              This research explores a new delay test set, called a delay-  verification test
              set, which detects the presence of any path delay  faults that can affect the
              timing of the circuit.  The approach is  to find necessary and sufficient
              conditions for delay  verifiability; i.e., the existence of a complete
              delay-verification  test set.  Algorithms for the synthesis of area-efficient,
              delay-  verifiable circuits and the generation of delay verification test  sets
              are being developed.  A second topic being explored is a  design and test
              methodology for sequential circuits without scan  latches in functional paths. 
              A method, based on clock suppression,  is being used to generate transitions on
              state variables for delay  testing.  State assignment techniques to improve
              delay-fault  testability without scan and clock suppression are being 
              investigated.
