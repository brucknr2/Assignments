Abstract    :
              IRI-9320318  This  research  explores a sensor- and domain-independent  event- 
              driven sensing manager and sensing execution mechanism to address  the  need 
              for  reactive sensing in mobile  robot  architectures.  Success   in   reactive
                motor  control  will   have   important  applications  in  perceptually
              demanding applications  in  space,  environmental remediation, defense, and
              reconnaissance and rescue  operations.   The  specific objectives of  this 
              project  are  to  formalize the control scheme for an event-driven manager;
              develop  a  sensing  execution  manager;  and  create  a  general  purpose 
              structure  for representing, reasoning, and propagating  evidence  about  a 
              percept.  These objectives will lead to a system  which  can  model  a  percept
              independently of sensors  and  algorithms;  translate  this model into an
              executable sensing plan, given  the  intended task, state of the robot, and
              state of the world;  share  sensing  resources  if possible and arbitrate
              contention  if  not  possible; maintain sensing given the occurrence of
              uncontrollable  events   such  as  occlusions,  malfunctions,  and 
              environmental  change;  and temporarily reduce the computational load
              associated  with sensing without sacrificing certainty.  The research results 
              will  be  evaluated based on experiments on a CSM  Denning  MRV-3  mobile 
              robot using video, ultrasonic, and laser range  data  for  navigation   and 
              assessment  of  partially  known  environments.  Resulting  code  and  data 
              sets  will  be  made  available  over  internet.
