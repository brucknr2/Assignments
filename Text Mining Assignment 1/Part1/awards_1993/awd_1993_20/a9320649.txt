Abstract    :
              9320649  Olsen    The topic of school choice has figured prominently in recent 
              public policy debates on education reform.  These debates have  been long on
              rhetoric and short on systematic empirical studies.   In this dissertation, the
              investigator will develop and  empirically test a model that allows inferences
              into the  following questions about school choice: (1) Which children  receive
              a higher quality education, and which receive a lower  quality education under
              various voucher schemes? (2) Does there  exist a voucher scheme, or class of
              voucher schemes, which  results in all children receiving a higher quality
              education than  they current receive? (3) What role do inter-neighborhood
              housing  price variations and transportation costs play in constraining 
              households moving their children from their current schools to  higher quality
              schools? (4) Which types of schools will  experience an increase in demand and
              which types a decrease as a  result of the voucher scheme?    This grant will
              permit the investigator to collect data from a  random sample of 600 households
              living in a metropolitan area and  having at least one child in elementary
              school.  Data to be  collected under this project do not currently exist in one
              data  set or in a form which allows the investigator to use data from  various
              sources.  The survey data will permit the investigator to  conduct realistic
              simulations about the impacts of different  school choice schemes.
