Abstract    :
              9320575  Mikic         The investigators will study the physical properties of 
              active-regions in the sun's corona from the topology of the  magnetic field. 
              In a prior grant, the investigators developed a  technique to determine the
              coronal magnetic field configuration  from vector magnetograph measurements of
              the photospheric magnetic  field.  Vector magnetographs measure the Zeeman
              splitting of  magnetically sensitive spectral lines.  The investigators will 
              study a numer of different properties of coronal magnetic fields.   They will
              compare the topology of active-region coronal fields to  observational features
              believed to trace field lines.  They will  also relate the morphology of flare
              phenomena to the structure of  the coronal magnetic fields.  They will study
              the evolution of the  coronal field above an active region using a sequence of 
              magnetograms and develop realistic models of active region magnetic  fields.
