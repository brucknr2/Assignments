Abstract    :
              9320488  McCarthy         This is a study of the reliability of mass media
              reports of  collective action events in Washington D.C., and the development 
              of an expanded data base to allow comprehensive social-scientific  analysis of
              the biases in media reporting.  The project has five  related aims: to add city
              permits and media records of  demonstrations from 1973 to the existing data
              set; to code the  content of all media traces for analyses of description bias;
              to  expand the analysis of media bias by developing multiple methods  for
              comparing media reports with systematic observations; to  assess implications
              of the findings for improving attempts to  limit researcher bias; and to
              explore the possibilities of  studying the national and international diffusion
              of the National  Park Service permit system.  %%%       This research
              contributes to political sociology and to the  development of scientific
              methodology for studying public  demonstrations and their handling by the mass
              media.  It  therefore will greatly strengthen social-scientific research on 
              important aspects of democracy that lie outside the system of  parties and
              elections.  Results will be of direct value for  political leaders who need to
              understand the meaning of public  demonstrations and for journalists who need
              to upgrade the  accuracy of their reporting.    ***
