Abstract    :
              9320992  Tai    Concurrent software systems are becoming more common and
              generally require very high reliability.  Software analysis and testing
              techniques are critical for reducing software development cost and improving
              software quality.  This project will investigate efficient techniques for
              reachability analysis of concurrent information not only for the verification
              of safety and liveness properties, but also for the generation of tests.  The
              proposed approach to reachability analysis is a combination of incremental and
              partial-order analysis.  For a concurrent program, sequences of synchronization
              events will be generated from the specification and implementation of this
              program and will be used to force deterministic executions of this program. 
              This project will implement analysis and testing tools for concurrent software
              and will carry out experimental studies.  ***
