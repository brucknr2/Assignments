              Abstract  ATM-9320193  Zhang, Chidong  University of Washington  Title:   
              Intraseasonal Variability of Atmospheric Large-Scale            Environment for
              Deep Convection in the Western Pacific    Case and composite studies are
              proposed to investigate three events  of the tropical intraseasonal oscillation
              (TIO) during the  Intensive Observing Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global
               Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment  (COARE).  Data
              collected during the COARE IOP (1 November 1992 - 28  February 1993) from the
              Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) mooring  arrays, ships, surface and sounding
              stations, and Japanese  Geosynchronic Meteorology Satellite (GMS), and wind
              analyses from  the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF)
              will  be analyzed.    The proposed research will focus on the variability of
              large-scale  atmospheric environment in which deep convection is promoted or 
              surpassed on the intraseasonal time scales.  Specifically, the  proposed
              project will:       (i) Detect the intraseasonal variability of surface wind
              and  convergence, surface/boundary-layer thermal conditions (including  surface
              turbulent heat fluxes, humidity and temperature, moist  static energy, etc.),
              vertical thermodynamic and dynamic structures  of the atmosphere, and surface
              precipitation;       (ii) Explore intraseasonal coherent signatures of these 
              variables with tropospheric winds and satellite cloud entitles  subdivided by
              areal extent and cloud-top height.    Through the case studies of the three TIO
              events during the COARE  IOP, the PI and the co-investigators of the project
              will attempt a  synthesized view of the large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic 
              structures of the TIO.  The synthesized view of the TIO will  include the
              spatial structures, evolutions, and interrelationships  of three-dimensional
              wind field, surface and boundary-layer thermal  conditions, atmospheric
              vertical structures, convective cloud  populations and organization,
              precipitation, and characteri stics of  air-sea interactions associated with
              the TIO.  The results from  this project will provide necessary information for
              enhancement of  our overall understanding of the TIO and for improvement and 
              validation of theories and numerical modeling of the TIO.
