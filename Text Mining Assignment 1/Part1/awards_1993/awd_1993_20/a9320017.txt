Abstract    :
              9320017  Khatib    The research studies concepts and methods for development of
              an  automated mobile robotic assistant to aid human workers in various  aspects
              of transporting, fixturing, and attaching or assembling  heavy materials.  The
              project investigates the planning, sensing,  perception, and control needed for
              robots to work cooperatively  with humans and other robots.  In the first stage
              of the research,  a robot assistant will act as an amplifier for a human
              operator,  responding under guidance to lift and move heavy or awkward 
              material.  Next, real-time 3D range and motion vision will be  incorporated to
              extend the system's capabilities with respect to  obstacles and dynamic path
              considerations.  Finally, multiple  assistants, each with vision, force
              sensing, and communication  capabilities, will work cooperatively and with the
              operator to  handle more difficult pieces, while continuing under human 
              supervision.  The results of this research should be applicable to 
              construction-site operations, heavy manufacturing, and a variety of  other
              applications involving heavy and/or awkward-sized objects.
