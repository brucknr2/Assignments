Abstract    :
              9320352  Kash    This three-year award supports U.S.-Ireland cooperative
              research in  technological innovation between Don Kash of George Mason 
              University and William Kingston of Trinity College in Dublin,  Ireland.  The
              objective of the study is to trace the evolution of  technological innovation
              through research on the "interference  files" of the United States Patent and
              Trademark Office.  The award  supports dissertation research and travel to
              Ireland for the  principal investigator and an advanced graduate student to
              analyze  the data with Dr. Kingston, a world renown scholar and expert on 
              patents.    Historically U.S. patents have been granted, not to the first to 
              file an application, but the first to invent. When two applications  have been
              filed nearly simultaneously, the patent examiner declares  an "interference"
              and both parties must provide evidence as to  their respective dates of
              invention.  This evidence usually reveals  the details of every aspect of the
              generation of the invention and  is a rich source on the process of innovation.
              Dr. Kash brings to  this collaboration expertise on innovation.  This is
              complemented  by Dr. Kingston's research on patent systems and intellectual 
              property rights. The proposed research will advance our  understanding of the
              innovation process and patent behavior and  their public policy implications.
