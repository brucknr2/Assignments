Abstract    :
              CTS-9320135  University of Texas at Austin  William J. Koros    ABSTRACT    The
              objective of this SGER project is the organization and development of a
              National Separations Summer School for new faculty in chemical engineering.  A
              trend in hiring new engineering professors in nontraditional emerging areas
              coupled with industrial restructuring including massive early retirement
              programs threatens the transfer of fundamental knowledge and skill as well as
              the infrastructure in the chemical industry sector.  With a scope spanning from
              traditional separation methods to new technologies, the course should prepare
              faculty to be more effective instructors in separations and should stimulate
              their active participation in the field with new research directions.      FLW
