Abstract    :
                     Rubel  9320624        This project supports the research of a team of
              cultural  anthropologists studying how people in two Mexican communities 
              conceive of respiratory disease in general and pulmonary  tuberculosis in
              particular.  Using a quantitative technique of  consensus analysis, the project
              will interview two cohorts of  patients: TB sufferers, and patients who have
              not been diagnosed  with that specific disease but who exhibit respiratory
              symptoms.  The specific hypotheses to be tested relate to how individuals 
              adapt their folk understanding of a well-defined disease to the  biomedical
              model which they are exposed to during treatment --  whether persons more
              expert in their own folk theory are better  able to learn a different,
              biomedical theory.       This project is important because many local
              populations  have folk models of disease; advances in our understanding of how 
              individuals holding these models adapt in response to specific  experiences and
              information can help design delivery procedures  which increase people's
              compliance with medical treatments.  ***
