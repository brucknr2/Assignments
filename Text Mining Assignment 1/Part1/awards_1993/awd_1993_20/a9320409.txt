Abstract    :
              9320409  Ramakrishnan    This award supports a U.S.-U.K. Workshop on Fiber
              Reinforced  Cement and Concrete to be held in Sheffield, United Kingdom, June 
              1994.  The objectives of the workshop are to review the most  recent advances
              in the field of fiber-reinforced cement based  composities and to identify
              future collaborative research  directions.  The workshop will also address the
              different forms  of composites with discrete or continuous fibers, the 
              characteristics of advanced cement as they influence the  properties of
              composites, and worldwide standards or  specifications for the use of
              fiber-reinforced concretes. The co-  chairpersons are V. Ramakrishnan of the
              South Dakota School of  Mines and Technology and R.N. Swamy of the University
              of  Sheffield.      Rapid advances have occured in the development and
              application of  new materials of construction like fiber-reinforced composites,
               especially in the United Kingdom. New cement composites are of  great
              importance to civil infrastructure efforts as they can  extend the life of many
              existing, old facilities and provide for  new, longer-lasting and economic
              structures.  The proposed  workshop will advance U.S. research efforts in this
              area through  information exchange and initiation of links with leading 
              researchers in the United Kingdom.  ***
