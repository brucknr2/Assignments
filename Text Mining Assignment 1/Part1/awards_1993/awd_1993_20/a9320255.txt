Abstract    :
              9320255  Goldfarb  In each of three summers, carefully selected pairs of science
               teachers from fifteen high schools will take part in a program to  help them
              reformulate their science courses so as to offer  students the opportunity to
              learn concepts and skills within the  context of ethical inquiry.  The teachers
              will explore a variety  of contemporary issues confronting practicing
              scientists which  raise questions of ethics and values.  They will select
              issues  for development into lessons on the basis of their own interests  and
              experience.  Specific attention will be given to the  multitude of ethics
              issues related to the explosive developments  in biotechnology, and the
              teachers will also peform genetic  engineering experiments to illustrate the
              techniques and their  applications.  Follow-up sessions held during the fall
              and spring  will be used to encourage the teacher pairs to share and critique 
              the progress they have made in integrating ethics and values  issues into their
              own curricula.  The project instructors,  working with the teachers, will edit
              teaching materials that have  been developed and distribute them to all
              participants.  Both the  case studies and instructional materials for the
              institute, and  the teaching materials, will also be widely disseminated to
              other  interested teachers and administrators.  A broadbased advisory 
              committee will oversee and evaluate the project, as will a  project consultant
              and the participants themselves.  ***
