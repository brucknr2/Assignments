Abstract    :
                  9320715  Impey         This project involves a systematic study of the
              properties of  quasars, using the recently completed Large Bright Quasar Survey
               (LBQS).  The objective and quantifiable selection criteria for the  LBQS will
              allow a calculation of the probability of detecting a  quasar as a function of
              redshift and optical luminosity.  There  will be a determination of the
              sensitivity of derived quantities  such as the luminosity function to the shape
              of the spectral energy  distribution.  The Principal Investigators will
              continue deep and  shallow radio observations of the LBQS, in order to
              understand the  bimodal distribution of radio luminosity.  The environments and
               host galaxies of low redshift quasars (0.4 < z < 1) from the LBQS  will be
              studied.  The Principal Investigators will construct global  energy
              distributions from radio to X-ray wavelengths for subsamples  of the LBQS, in
              order to compare to the space density and evolution  of quasars selected at
              other wavelengths.  In addition to  continuing to exploit the LBQS, the
              Principal Investigators will  begin two new quasar surveys.  The first will use
              red objective  prism plates to look for rare populations of bright and high 
              redshift (2 < z < 4) quasars.  The second will use a multicolor  digital sky
              survey to isolate large numbers of high and low  redshift quasars, sufficient
              for studies of clustering and for a  major improvement in our understanding of
              the luminosity function.
