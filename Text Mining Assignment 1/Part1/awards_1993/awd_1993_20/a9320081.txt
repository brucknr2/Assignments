Abstract    :
              9320081  Granger  In the past decade policy makers have become increasingly 
              concerned with the environmental and atmospheric consequences of  the
              deforestation of the world's tropical forests.   Unfortunately, high level
              decision-makers have had very little  hard data with which to form their
              policies regarding the  utilization of forest resources.  This project intends
              to use a  newly available economic and ecological dataset for the Amazon 
              region in Brazil to analyze the long-run economic and  environmental
              consequences of various forestry-related activities  under a variety of
              regimes.  On of the major issues to be  analyzed is how the presence of roads
              or the existence of land  tenure programs may influence the long-run effects
              that forestry  activities have on the economy and ecology of a region.  By 
              providing a better understanding of how many factors interact  over time to
              affect both the environment and the economy, this  study would provide policy
              makers with valuable information and  contribute to the effort to balance human
              economic need with  environmental concerns.  ***
