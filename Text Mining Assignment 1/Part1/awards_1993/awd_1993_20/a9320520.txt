Abstract    :
              9320520  Chang    This proposal is designed to study the mechanism of buckytubes
              and  buckybundies nucleation and growth in a controlled DC arc  discharge.  A
              model will be developed to explain the physical  mechanisms.  In addition,
              properties of buckytubes and monolayer  buckytubes will be characterized and
              studied.  A new arc system  will be designed and constructed especially for
              this program.  ***
