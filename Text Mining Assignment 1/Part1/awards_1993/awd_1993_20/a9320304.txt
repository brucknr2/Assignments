Abstract    :
              9320304  DeLong  The Mississippi River and some of its tributaries are currently
              experiencing catastrophic floods which have significantly modified their
              typical hydrological patterns.  The ecological impacts of an extreme flood
              occurring outside of the normal flood period should have substantial effects on
              this important lotic ecosystem, such as altering normal patterns of imput,
              storage, and transport of organic matter and nutrients.  In addition, sources
              of organic matter which are not normally available may be introduced into the
              river at this time.  These changes in nutrient supply and timing should act as
              major disturbance to the trophic dynamics of the Mississippi River Ecosystem. 
              %%%  We hypothesize that the catastrophic flood presently occurring in the
              Mississippi River ecosystem will produce a shift in normal tropical processes
              by altering the role of different sources of organic matter in the riverine
              food web.  This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating the stable-isotype
              ratios in the food webs of four rivers (two flooded and two unflooded, flood
              plain rivers).  During three dates over a year period, we will collect 5
              replicates of 21 sample units per river, each representing a nutrient source or
              organic  processor.  We will then determine the composition 13C and 15N and C/N
              ratio in the sample units.  To ascertain whether changes in the Mississippi
              River ecosystem over time reflect the effects of the flood or merely represent
              normal variations, we will obtain samples from four rivers: the Missouri and
              upper Mississippi Rivers, which are currently experiencing the worst floods of
              the century, and the Oh io and Wabash Rivers, which are flood plain rivers that
              have not been inundated by flood waters.  Information from this study will
              contribute to a data base useful for making management decisions involving the
              role of flood plains in river ecosystems.
