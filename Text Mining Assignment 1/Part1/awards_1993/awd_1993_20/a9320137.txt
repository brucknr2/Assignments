Abstract    :
              9320137  Congleton    Increased worker productivity and safety are directly
              related to  ergonomics.  An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
               Ergonomics can study the systematic and rational means to fit the  work to the
              person.  The primary goal of the proposed Center's  research would be to
              improve work performance and safety through  the study and development of
              general principles that govern the  interaction of humans and their working
              environment.    This action funds Texas A&M University to hold a planning
              meeting  with potential industry members to determine a possible research 
              agenda for the Center and its potential for support as an  Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center.    The Co-Principal Investigators are nationally
              recognized  researchers in ergonomics and have the facilities to conduct a 
              planning meeting.    The Program Manager recommends that Texas A&M University
              be awarded  $10,000 for one year for this project.
