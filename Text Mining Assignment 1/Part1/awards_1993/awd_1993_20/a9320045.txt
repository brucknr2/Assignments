Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT    9320045  Hogan    This grant will support
              research on two projects in  observational cosmology.  As a test of hot big
              bang  cosmology, the PI and a graduate student propose to measure  the cosmic
              abundance of deuterium in high redshift QSO  absorption clouds, using
              high-resolution spectra (about 10-  20 km/sec) of five QSO's with high column
              density hydrogen  absorbers known to be optically thick in the Lyman 
              continuum.  Using fits to a number of Lyman  series  absorption lines in each
              absorption system they aim to  obtain D/H in the absorbing clouds with
              sufficient accuracy  for a rigorous test of cosmological theory, a test of the 
              universal character of the deuterium abundance, and a  measurement of the
              abundance in a relatively pristine  environment where the universe is much
              younger.  The PI and  another graduate student propose to detect and catalogue 
              line-emitting galaxies near damped QSO absorbers, using  narrow-band imaging of
              damped QSO absorber and high-redshift  protogalaxies, which will be used to
              constrain theories of  cosmic structure formation.  Data for both projects will
              be  gathered primarily at the new 3.5M telescope at the Apache  Point
              Observatory.  ***
