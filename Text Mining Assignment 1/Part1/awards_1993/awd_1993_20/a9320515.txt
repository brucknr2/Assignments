Abstract    :
              9320515  Lawler  Research on Atomic Transitions Probabilities for selected rare 
              earth elements including thulium (Tm), dysprosium (Dy), and  holmium (Ho)is
              proposed.  These elements are candidates for  introduction into a new
              generation of High Intensity Discharge  (HID) lamps being developed in U.S.
              industrial laboratories.  Advanced HID lamps have promise for improving
              lighting efficiency  (luminous efficacy) and lighting quality (color rendering
              index).  Lighting consumes 20 to 25% of the U.S. electrical energy output.  The
              fundamental spectroscopic data to be measured under this  proposed grant are
              urgently needed for modeling and diagnosing  these new lamp designs.   The
              Wisconsin Atomic Transition  Probability Program will be extended to these rare
              earths.  This  program has, since its inception in 1980, continually developed 
              and applied advanced laser and Fourier transform techniques to  measure atomic
              transition probabilities on neutral and singly  ionized elements.  Efficient
              new techniques will be developed to  deal with the very rich and complex rare
              earth spectra, while  maintaining the precision and absolute accuracy achieved
              in  earlier work on lighter elements.  Close contact with industrial  scientist
              will be throughout this project.  ***
