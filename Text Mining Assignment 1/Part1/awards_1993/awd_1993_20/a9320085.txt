Abstract    :
              9320085  HENSLER  This workshop will bring together a number of scholars from 
              different disciplines, including economists, social scientists, and  academic
              lawyers, to develop a research initiative on the civil  justice system.  The
              workshop will use problems having to do with  tort litigation as a point of
              departure for considering a larger  set of empirical questions about the role
              of the civil justice  system in our society.  Current controversies over tort
              litigation  stem from claims that tort liability is a barrier to technological 
              innovation, that malpractice suits are a major cause of increased  costs in the
              health care system, and that lawyers are simply lining  their pockets at the
              expense of insurance companies, consumers, and  the overall economy rather than
              serving the interests of justice.   Counter claims hold that the system serves
              the powerless and the  ordinary citizen who has suffered harm.  This side of
              the debate  argues that the critics have no empirical grounds for their 
              complaints.   Knowledgeable social scientists are concerned that  the debate is
              not based on valid empirical data, but rather on  numbers generated by junk
              science.  This workshop will focus on  policy issues, data sources,
              methodological problems, and broader  theoretical questions.  Its product will
              be a research agenda on  civil justice for the Law and Social Science Program.
