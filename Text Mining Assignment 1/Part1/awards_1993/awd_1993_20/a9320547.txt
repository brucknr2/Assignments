Abstract    :
                    9320547  Broderick    This research will be devoted to using the Very
              Large Array (VLA)  in Socorro, New Mexico for a very sensitive large-scale
              survey of  the sky north of -42 degrees declination.  The VLA will be used to 
              make more than 200,000 snapshot observations which will be combined  to produce
              2326 maps.  These maps will have a nearly uniform  sensitivity of less than 0.4
              mjy.  It is expected that about 2  million sources will be found.  The maps and
              source list will be  made available to the astronomical community as soon as
              they are  finished via electronic mail, CD-ROMS, and other media.  The data 
              will be used by the Principal Investigator to search for Active  Galactic
              Nuclei in nearby galaxies.    The Principal Investigator has had many years of
              experience in work  of this type and his work is very highly regarded by the 
              astronomical community.  ***
