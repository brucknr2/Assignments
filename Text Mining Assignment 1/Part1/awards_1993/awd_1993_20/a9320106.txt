Abstract    :
               Many decision tasks induce stress, either because of cognitive demands or
              because of emotional factors.  To what extent are people able to compensate for
              cognitive and emotional stressors by adapting their decision processes? The
              research will focus on how information processing strategies are adapted to
              variations in time pressure and emotional stress.   The proposed research uses
              an integrated methodology involving computer simulation and experiments
              utilizing process-tracing methods to investigate decision making under stress
              at a detailed information-processing level.  Computer simulation will be used
              to estimate the performance of various decision strategies under stressful
              conditions; then several experiments will examine whether individuals adapt to
              stress by changing processing in ways consistent with the simulation results. 
              The studies focus on a new opportunity-cost manipulation of time pressure and
              two new manipulations of emotional stress, one altering the salience and
              vividness of the consequences of actions and one altering the difficulty of the
              tradeoffs involved in the choice task.
