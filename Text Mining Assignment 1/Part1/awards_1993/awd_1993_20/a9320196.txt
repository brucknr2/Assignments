Abstract    :
              9320196  Gibson    A "polyrotaxane" consists of cyclic molecules physically
              threaded  onto a linear macromolecule with no covalent bonds between the 
              cyclics and the linear backbone; bulky end groups may be fitted to  the chain
              ends to prevent loss of the macrocycles via dethreading.   Polyrotaxanes show
              unique behavior in terms of solubility, solid  state structure and phase
              transitions.  In this research,  fundamental understanding of the threading of
              cyclic molecules by  linear species is sought with respect to factors such as
              the nature  of the two components (size, rigidity, structural similarity), the 
              solvent (conformational aspects of the two components) and  temperature. 
              Entirely new polyrotaxanes of several types will be  synthesized.  Rotaxanes
              derived from polymeric macrocycles, both  backbone and pendant, will be
              utilized in blend compatibilization  and viscosity enhancement.  Dendrimers
              with rotaxane surfaces will  allow tailoring of the shape and surface
              functionality of these  versatile entities.  Self-assembly will be utilized in
              two ways:   1) to generate copolymers of block and graft types through 
              complexation and rotaxane formation and 2 use of the physical  functionality
              associated with the cyclic and linear components in  the preparation of novel
              "slip link" macromolecules, which are  expected to be uniquely compliant in
              both tension and compression.    Results from this research will span the range
              from basic  understanding, practical application to manipulate properties of 
              known backbones, and preparation of entirely new types of  structures.  ***
