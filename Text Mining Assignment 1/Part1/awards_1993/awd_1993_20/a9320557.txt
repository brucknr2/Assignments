Abstract    :
              9320557  Stoker    This grant continues a research program on the implementation
              of  semiparametric estimators.  The overall thrust of the work is to  study the
              operational characteristics of various semiparametric  and nonparametric
              estimators to study what methods are most  useful for application to economic
              problems and especially to  problems in environmental economics.  The previous
              work focused  on introducing and developing average derivative estimators and 
              single and partial index models, and nonparametric kernel  estimators of
              regression and derivatives.  The proposed research  will study many issues of
              implementation, from basic measurement  issues for nonparametric techniques to
              specification tests for  choosing an empirically adequate index model
              specification.  The  overall aim is to develop and communicate practical
              guidelines  for empirical work to applied economists.  The proposed research 
              will be carried out in conjunction with a study of pollution and  other
              environmental issues using survey data from families in  Haifa, Israel.
