Abstract    :
              9320938  Curry  This project is an integrated experimental and modeling effort
              to  understand and interpret the evolution of sea ice characteristics,  cloud
              properties, and radiation fluxes during the autumnal freezing  of the coastal
              waters of the Beaufort Sea.  It will carried out in  the scientific context of
              the Beaufort and Arctic Seas Experiment  (BASE), a Canadian program whose
              objective is an improved  understanding of weather systems in the Canadian
              Arctic, and whose  focus is the hydrologic balance of the Mackenzie River. 
              This  project will make use of the NCAR C-130 aircraft, and BASE will  provide
              substantial synergistic observational facilities.  The  direct aircraft
              observations will be supplemented by satellite data  to extend the time and
              space scales of the analyses, and will be  used to interpret and validate
              satellite retrieval algorithms.  A  three-dimensional mesoscale model of the
              atmosphere will be used to  interpret the temporal and spatial evolution of the
              sea ice cover  and the atmospheric boundary layer characteristics.  A coupled
              sea  ice model will be used to interpret the physical processes of the  sea ice
              that respond to atmospheric forcing.  The result of the  research will be an
              improved understanding of the atmospheric  modulation of the surface radiation
              balance and the effect of the  radiation balance on the freezing of coastal
              waters.  ***
