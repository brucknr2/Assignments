Abstract    :
              9320098  Barbieri     This award is for assembling a high performance platform
              for the synthesis and implementation of advanced sensing and control
              algorithms.   Testbed hardware is for applications in robotics and flexible
              structure sensing and control.  The platform is designed around a 486-class
              computer.  It is equipped with a 20 MHz 4-channel digital scope, and a DSP
              motion controller based on a Texas Instrument TMS 320C30 floating-point DSP
              board, a 12-bit D/A converter, a 32-channel 16-bit A/D converter, a five
              channel incremental encoder, two digital I/O and timers, and a real time
              tracer.  The boards are enclosed within a 20-slot industrial-quality box and
              interconnected via a 32-bit bus.  High-level programming is done at the system
              block level via SIMULINK.  The MATLAB files are automatically converted to
              portable C-code and downloaded to the DSP boards.  The station will have a
              direct impact on the following interdisciplinary ongoing research projects: (1)
              use of redundant degrees of freedom in a manipulator to suppress vibrations,
              (2) modeling and control of flexible structures instrumented with an ultrasonic
              ranging system, (3) nonlinear control of a flexible arm using inertial devices,
              and (4) development of an ultrasonic 3-dimensional vibration measurement system
              and generic modeling of intelligent learning sensors.  ***
