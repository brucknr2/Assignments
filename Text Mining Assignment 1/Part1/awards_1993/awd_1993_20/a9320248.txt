Abstract    :
              9320248  Lewenstein  In order for citizens in a democracy to make informed
              decisions  about science and technology policy, they must have a certain basic 
              understanding of how science and technology work.  Providing such  an
              understanding is one of the tasks given to the National Science  Foundation. 
              This dissertation aims to study one way that  scientists attempt to communicate
              to the general public the results  of their research:  i.e. exhibits in science
              and natural history  museums.  Steven Allison, under the direction of Dr.
              Lewenstein, is  exploring the relationships between scientific research and the
               public representation of natural knowledge.  He is investigating  how
              scientists in four different museums have attempted to  communicate to the
              public their understanding of the ecology of  tropical rain forests.    The
              major case for Mr. Allison's study is at the Smithsonian.  He  is following how
              a tropical rain forest exhibit which began in 1960  with plans for a Hall of
              Botany was transformed in the late 1960's  into an exhibit hall on ecosystems
              and was finally built in 1974 as  a temporary exhibit motivated by the
              environmental movement.  His  preliminary research has shown that changes in
              the definition of  "ecology," professionalization of the exhibit development
              process,  and the rise of the environmentalist movement all shaped the 
              changing form and content of the exhibit.    Two exhibitions at the British
              Museum (Natural History) offer the  opportunity for comparison to the
              Smithsonian case.  The 1961  botany hall provides an example of more didactic
              exhibits than the  Smithsonian botanists planned for their hall, while the 1989
               exhibition "Ecology" deploys visual and verbal presentations that  are very
              similar to the final Smithsonian exhibit in the 1970's.   He is also making
              less detailed comparisons of exhibition practice  at the American Museum of
              Natural History in New York, the Denver  Museum of Natural History, and the
              1992 "Amazonia" exhibit at the  National Zoologica l Park.  These individual
              cases promise to make  significant contributions not only to the history of
              natural  history research but to broader issues of concern for public 
              understanding of science.  Parallels between the historical and  contemporary
              exhibitions raise questions about the role of museums  in the public
              communication of science, especially environmental  issues.  ***
