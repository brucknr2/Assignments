Abstract    :
              9320192  Neuts     This award is for the acquisition of two SparcStation 10
              Model 30 workstations for the Laboratory of Algorithmic Research in the
              Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering at the University of Arizona. 
              The workstations would significantly upgrade present equipment in the
              Laboratory.  The research involved deals with point processes, queues and other
              probability models primarily related to communications engineering.  It
              requires major implementations of numerical and symbolic algorithms as well as
              extensive computer experimentation.  Methods for the analysis of queueing
              models involve computer-intensive matrix-iterative methods.  One line of
              research is to develop methods suitable for large matrices.  Such investigation
              will require more advanced workstations than those presently in the Laboratory.
               Another line of current work deals with data-analytic methods for very large
              sets of counting data.  In addition to processing speed and excellent graphics
              the investigation requires a workstation with a large memory.  Equipment in the
              Laboratory of Algorithmic Research is also used by others for research.  One
              group deals with modeling the spread of epidemics and with methodology for
              automated computer learning and optimization.  Another is for investigating
              Markov decision problems and a variety of their applications.  In addition,
              these researchers are developing mathematical software  for the solution of
              Markov decision problems.  The Laboratory also attracts many visiting
              researchers and postdoctoral fellows.  The equipment in the laboratory further
              supports the computational needs of these in dividuals.  ***  h
