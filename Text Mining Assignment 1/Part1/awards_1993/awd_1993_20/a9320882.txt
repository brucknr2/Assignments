Abstract    :
              Branson  9320882       This award supports a geometry research conference to be 
              held in April 1994 at the University of Iowa.  The conference is  designed to
              enhance communication, cooperation, and collaborative  research among
              differential geometers in the Midwest, to  disseminate important recent
              research developments, and to  introduce advanced graduate students and
              postdoctoral researchers  to important topics in geometry research.  Topics to
              be presented  include Einstein metrics and their moduli spaces, existence and 
              geometric properties of certain Riemannian functionals arising in  scalar
              curvature, the relationship between symplectic geometry to  spectral
              asymptotics, and applications of geometric methods to  mathematics physics.
