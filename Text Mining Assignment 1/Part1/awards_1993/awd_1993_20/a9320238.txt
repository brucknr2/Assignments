Abstract    :
                    9320238  Welch    The Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA) is a
              millimeter-wave  interferometer presently made up of 6 six-meter diameter
              antennas;  expansion to at least 9 antennas is planned during the next few 
              years. Located at Berkeley's Hat Creek Radio Observatory, BIMA was  jointly
              capitalized and is jointly operated by the University of  California at
              Berkeley, the University of Illinois and the  University of Maryland through a
              combination of NSF and State  funding.     These awards are for identical
              proposals submitted simultaneously  by each institution, and support
              astronomical research,  technological development and student training carried
              out at the  BIMA array. Astronomical research at BIMA includes high resolution 
              studies of solar system objects, stellar envelopes, star-forming  regions in
              the Galaxy, and molecular clouds in external galaxies.  Notable accomplishments
              during the past three years at BIMA include  expansion to 6 elements, the
              development of a novel high-  reliability 4K closed cycle refrigerator stage,
              the detection of  bands in the Jovian atmosphere at millimeter wavelengths, and
               infall onto star forming cores. During the next grant period  observations
              will continue, the array will be expanded to a total  of at least 9 elements,
              and the array baselines will be extended to  at least 750 meters, providing
              angular resolution of 0.2 arcseconds  at a wavelength of 1.3mm.
