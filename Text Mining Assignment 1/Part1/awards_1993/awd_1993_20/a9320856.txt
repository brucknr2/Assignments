Abstract    :
              9320856  Rotemberg  This research explores two related issues of organization 
              structure. The first issue is why conflicts arise and why  the conflicts take
              on predictable forms. The second aim is  to understand the process for
              allocating formal authority.  In the study the basic question that is asked is
              which  groups and individuals tend to be put in charge of various  decisions?
              In order to understand the process, the study  concentrates on the canonical
              conflict between marketing and  production departments. Usually, the
              manufacturing section  wants to produce relatively few products on a large
              scale  while the marketing section would prefer to have a "complete  product
              line". One explanation for this is that past  activity within the firm has led
              employees in different  areas to learn different things. On  the second issue
              of  formal authority, the study seeks to develop a model where  costs to
              information flow lead firms to put certain  individuals in authority but the
              authority and power do not  always reside in the same person. The results from
              this  study would provide a basis for understanding the cases  where firms
              benefit from putting valuable employees in  authority and those where they do
              not.  ***
