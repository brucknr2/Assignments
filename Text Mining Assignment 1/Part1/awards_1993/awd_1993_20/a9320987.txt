Abstract    :
              9320987  Kozik  Canisius College  Dr. Mariusz M. Kozik, Chemistry Department,
              Cansius College, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program for  research into the properties, activation,
              of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide when complexed to
              heteropolyoxide ions. Complexes of  carbon dioxide with a variety of
              heteropolyoxides containing tungsten and another metal will be prepared and
              characterized.  The electrochemical properties of these complexes will be
              examined by cyclic voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis.
              Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to methane will be attempted at
              potentials close to the thermodynamic value of -0.24 v.  Carbon dioxide is a
              cheap, easily obtained, non-toxic material which theoretically can be converted
              to a variety of useful products including hydrocarbon fuels. However, its use
              has been limited because it is an unreactive compound which is difficult to
              activate. In this project a new electrochemical method will be developed to
              cleanly convert of carbon dioxide to methane in an energy efficient manner.
