Abstract    :
              9320342   Diaz   This is a travel award for an exploratory visit to the
              Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain and  to attend the XI International
              Symposium on Biogeochemistry in Salamanca, Spain. This travel will  provide
              opportunities to meet faculty and examine facilities at the University of
              Barcelona. The  purpose of the visits is to facilitate discussion of potential
              postdoctoral training, and tentative planning  of scientific research to be
              pursued. Professor Jordi Mas of the University of Barcelona has invited  her to
              visit his laboratory for this purpose, and in ultimately serving as her mentor.
