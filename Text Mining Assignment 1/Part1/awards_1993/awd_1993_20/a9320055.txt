Abstract    :
              9320055  Hiltner    This award is for a joint research effort between Case
              Western  Reserve University's Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center
              for Applied Polymers and Lehigh University's  Industry/University's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center for Polymer Interfaces.  The
              project "Novel Design Concepts  in Core/Shell Particles for Toughening
              Engineering Plastics" is to  be cost-shared by both Centers.  EniChem America
              is also  contributing a significant effort in processing and scale-up of the 
              new materials for testing.         This "TIE" project is studying a novel
              toughening concept which  involves the synthesis of new rubber latex particles
              composed of an  IPN network of two elastomers, inter-facially bonded in a 
              controlled manner to the matrix plastics.    The two I/UCRCs have the qualified
              staff and facilities to address  this project synergistically.    The Program
              Manager recommends Case Western Reserve University be  awarded $25,000 for the
              first year of a two-year continuing award.
