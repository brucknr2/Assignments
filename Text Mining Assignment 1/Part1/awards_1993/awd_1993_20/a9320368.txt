Abstract    :
              Weathers  9320368    This is a three-year cooperative research project proposed
              by  Drs. Duncan Weathers and Jerome Duggan, University of North  Texas, and
              Professors E.K. Lin and Yueh Chung Yu, Academia  Sinica.  This proposal is to
              conduct study to understand the  M-shell ionization of rare earth elements by
              incident carbon,  oxygen and silicon ions at the energies between 1 and 15 MeV 
              using the accelerator facilities in Taiwan and at the University  of North
              Texas.  The project plans to make 5,400 cross section  measurements of which
              2,700 will be made interaction, which is  fundamental to the development of
              most modern technologies.  This  project is jointly supported by the NSF and
              the Taiwan National  Science Council (NSC), which provides major support for 
              laboratory operation.  The modest support from the NSF in this  case is
              extensively leveraged by the NSC.
