Abstract    :
              9320782  Sabbagh   This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              project will support the development of an advanced  computational model for
              electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation  (NDE).  The model permits the
              calculation of the interaction  between a probe and a flaw that is located
              within a workplace.   It is based on a currently existing model that is being
              developed  by Sabbagh Associates, but will be extended to include the 
              capability of modeling flaws located near edges and corners, as  well as to
              model arrays of probes.  The project will also  integrate recent research in
              the areas of volume-integral and  boundary-integral equations in computational
              electromagnetics,  including the use of vector boundary elements and Whitney
              forms.    The result will be an advanced commercial software package that  can
              be used in fields as diverse as nondestructive evaluation,  medical imaging,
              geophysical prospecting, and materials  evaluation.
