Abstract    :
                    9320405  Liebowitz  This research will explore whether there exists a
              "universal"  fracture law that has sufficient generality so that it can be used
               for a large variety of applications, and to determine what form it  takes. 
              The undertaking will require a critical examination of the  currently existing
              special fracture laws, and then an  identification of the guiding principles
              for the formulation of a  universal fracture law.  Finally, the explicit form
              of this law  needs to be obtained, and verified against experimental results
              for  a variety of structural materials, geometry of structure, and  loading
              conditions.  Should this investigation establish that such  a universal law
              does not exist, then the investigators will develop  an expert system to be
              utilized for fracture analysis of real  mechanical and structural systems.  ***
