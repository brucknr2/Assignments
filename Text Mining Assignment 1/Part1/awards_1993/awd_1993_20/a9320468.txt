Abstract    :
              9320468  Slocum       A novel high-performance laser-pumped helium free
              precession  (LHFP) magnetometer is proposed for use for geomagnetic field 
              measurements and magnetic geophysical exploration.  In Phase I we  defined a
              concept for a portable laser-pumped helium 3 magnetometer  which has small
              size, high sensitivity and low power consumption.   A miniature tunable
              near-infrared laser pump source developed by  Polatomic for NASA was used to
              demonstrate laser pumping of   helium 3.  The laser pumping light will be
              carried by optical fiber  link between the sensor and the laser/electronics
              package.  During  Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of the laser-pumped
              helium  3 magnetometer and identified the laser pump source suitable for 
              pumping helium 3.  The concept will be validated in Phase II with  the design,
              fabrication and testing of a laser-pumped   helium 3 magnetometer.  In Phase II
              two sensors will be built in  order to evaluate a laser-pumped helium 3
              gradiometer.  The LHFP  magnetometer provides continuous read-out and has
              sensitivity  improved by more than an order of magnitude over the proton free 
              precession (PFP) magnetometer.  The laser pumped helium free  precession
              magnetometer for geomagnetic observatories and surveys  would replace the PFP
              magnetometer as the world standard.
