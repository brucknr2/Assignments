Abstract    :
              9320449  Miller  This award is for the continued development and scientific 
              application of a method whereby the component of the neutral wind  along a
              magnetic meridian can be derived from existing ground-based  measurements of
              the height of the F2 layer.  The meridional wind is  derived by a comparison of
              the modeled layer height with the  measured height.  This method can produce
              results comparable with  other methods, such as Fabry-Perot interferometry and
              incoherent-  scatter radar, and has the advantage that measurements of the 
              height of the F2 layer are already being made routinely and  systematically on
              a global scale.  The strength and variability of the meridional wind is of
              major  importance to the understanding of the energetics and composition  of
              the Thermosphere and Ionosphere.  It is perhaps the most  influential free
              parameter in thermosopheric photochemical models.   This study will increase
              our understanding of the magnitude and  variability of the meridional wind by
              providing global wind values  during measurement campaigns and by organizing
              the results into a  climatological description of thermospheric dynamics.  ***
