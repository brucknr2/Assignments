Abstract    :
              9450022  Scantlebury    This project will study the impact that incorporating
              gender equity  training into the secondary science education program has on the
               teaching practices of preservice and cooperating inservice  teachers.  Both
              groups will participate in summer workshops,  coursework, seminars, and
              meetings which will have gender equity in  the sciences as a central theme. 
              Key components include:   providing gender equity training for preservice and
              cooperating  inservice teachers; providing professional development for both 
              groups; utilizing inservice cooperating teachers in teaching  preservice
              methods courses; examining the effect this involvement  has on the cooperating
              teachers' gender-sensitive classroom  practices; mentoring of preservice
              teachers by cooperating teachers  and university faculty; establishing
              dialogues between university  science faculty and teachers.    Preservice
              teachers need specific training in equitable teaching  strategies and
              supervision by high school science ("cooperating")  teachers who are sensitive
              to gender equity issues.  The project is  aimed at encouraging preservice and
              cooperating teachers to develop  the characteristics of gender-sensitive
              science teachers through:  changing current coursework for preservice teachers;
              working  directly with cooperating teachers; including scientific research 
              opportunities for preservice teachers; transfer of educational and  scientific
              research to the classroom; linking programs to other  ongoing state and local
              efforts; providing integration between the  Colleges of Arts & Sciences and
              Education, and local school  systems; and presenting research at national
              meetings.  ***
