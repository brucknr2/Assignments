Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- III-9320416  Orozco     The proposed research focuses on a combined
              analytical and experimental investigation into the possibility of the use of
              metal foams as heat transfer enhancement devices.  Experimental facilities have
              been designed and fabricated to conduct the research and a third facility is in
              the design stage.  The theoretical portion of the investigation has focused on
              the development of an analytical model of film boiling and condensation.  The
              proposal focuses on a new type of material that shows great potential for use
              in augmentation applications in convection, boiling, and condensation.
