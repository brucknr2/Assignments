Abstract    :
              9320623  Scudder         In this proposal the PIs seek funding to develop direct
               theoretical arguments that the base of the transition region is an  especially
              fertile site for the suprathermal tail formation assumed  by the velocity
              filtration theory.  The vehicle that "carries" the  embryonic coronal gas is
              the suprathermal tail of the fully ionized  gas as it leaves the top of the
              chromosphere and that the mechanism  for the emergence of hot gas overlying
              cooler gas is the  concentrating effect velocity filtration has on the spatial 
              evolution of non-thermal distributions in an attractive potential  well.  In
              this view, the combined effects of (1) the copious waves  leading up to the TR
              base, (2) the convolution effects possible in  a stratified fully ionized
              plasma below the base, and (3) the  quasi-neutrality in the presence of coulomb
              collisions all leave  their "imprint" on the velocity distributions that are
              the boundary  conditions for the fully ionized extension of the solar
              atmosphere.   The velocity distribution functions evolve above the TR base in
              the  electric and magnetic force fields above this region as if they  were in a
              "velocity dependent reflecting transmission line" that  preferentially filters
              out the low energy particles in deference to  the higher energy particles of
              the initially suprathermal  populations.  These populations by velocity
              filtration get  concentrated and their dispersion and hence their temperature 
              increases without any further energy addition above the base of the  transition
              region.  ***
