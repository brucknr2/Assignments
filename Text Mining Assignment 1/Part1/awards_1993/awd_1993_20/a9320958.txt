Abstract    :
              9320958  Meer      This joint NSF/ARPA award funds a research planning workshop
              to be  held on June 24-25, 1994 in Seattle, Washington, following the IEEE 
              Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.  The  workshop will
              bring together statisticians and computer vision  researchers for discussion of
              improvement of the reliability of  computer vision algorithms by use of robust
              statistical estimation  methods which tolerate partially incorrect data, and
              methods for  estimating the confidence in the output of a computer vision task 
              by either analytical or computer-intensive methods.  This topic is  very
              important to the computer vision field, as it should help to  improve the
              linkage with knowledgeable statisticians, and lead to  more cogent application
              of statistical knowledge to computer vision  research.  The funding will
              provide partial support for many of the  attendees, who will also be attending
              the Computer Vision and  Pattern Recognition Conference just prior to the
              workshop, and will  enable a number of others not involved in the CVPR
              conference  (primarily statisticians) to travel to the workshop.  A proceedings
               will be made available to requesters at a modest handling cost  following the
              workshop.
