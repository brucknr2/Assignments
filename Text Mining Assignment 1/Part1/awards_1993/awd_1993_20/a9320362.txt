Abstract    :
                  9320362  Brownell    Chemosensory pathways in the central nervous system of
              animals generally lack the topographic organization commonly found in the
              visual, auditory and somatosensory systems.  A remarkable exception to this
              generalization has been discovered in chemosensory appendages called pectines
              of nocturnal sand scorpions.  These pectines contain an array involving roughly
              a million chemosensory neurons, which "map" in a precise spatial organization
              into a discrete part of the central nervous system.  This project uses
              chemistry, electrophysiology, anatomy and behavior to determine the chemical
              stimulus compounds that are deposited by these animals as they walk (apparently
              used for tracking by others), to determine how interactions between primary
              peripheral neurons can shape the sensory response to particular chemicals, and
              to determine the precision of topographic order in the central map from
              individual sensory afferent fibers.  The results will help understand the
              physical characteristics of substrate-associated chemosensory signals and how
              chemosensory systems are specialized for that role rather than for airborne or
              water-borne chemicals.  The use of an arthropod considered to represent a
              primitive group will lead to insights about the evolution of chemosensory
              sytems found in more derived arthropods such as crustaceans and insects. 
              Results also will have an impact on our understanding of how sensory neural
              systems in general utilize topographic maps for sensory information processing.
