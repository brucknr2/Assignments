Abstract    :
              9320397  Martin   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (LACM) is the
              repository of the second largest collection of Crustacea in the United States. 
              This extensive world-class research collection, part of which was formerly
              known as the Allan Hancock Foundation Crustacea Collection, contains the
              largest collection of eastern Pacific decapod crustaceans (crabs, shrimps,
              lobsters) in the world.  This proposal requests funds primarily for (1)
              temporary personnel to help physically transfer this incomparable collection of
              Decapoda from its current repository on the campus of the University of
              Southern California to the LACM.  Additional funds are requested for (2)
              purchasing archival quality jars, lids, and labels to rebottle the collection,
              much of which is currently housed in rapidly deterioration bail-top or
              metal-topped jars, (3) two locking, light-proof, environmentally stable metal
              cabinets for housing all type-specimens separately from the other crustacean
              holdings, (4) one medium quality stereomicroscope for rough sorting of mixed
              collections (those containing several taxa), and (5) material for shelf and
              carriage labeling, including one printer.
