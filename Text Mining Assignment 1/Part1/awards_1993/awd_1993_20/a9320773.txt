Abstract    :
              9301550  Mitchell       The Missouri Research and Education Network (MOREnet) is
               establishing a connection to NSFNET via a  56,000 bits per second  line for
              two community colleges and a community college district  comprising three
              campuses.  The institutions are Mineral Area  College, St. Charles County
              Community College, and the Metropolitan  Community College District.  The
              connection enables the faculties  and students to communicate and collaborate
              with the international  scientific and educational community, and to access
              network  resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers.  This 
              award funds part of the costs for two years.  ***    1  From: dstaudt at NOTE

              to the resources of the Internet, including libraries  and supercomputers.  In
              addition, they will be able to communicate and  collaborate with colleagues at
              other campuses in pursuit of research and  educational projects.    The award
              provides partial support of the project  for two years.
