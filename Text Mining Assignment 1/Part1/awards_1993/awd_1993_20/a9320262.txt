Abstract    :
              9310162  Li    Neurotransmitters are the molecular compounds that are used for 
              communication signals between nerve cells, or neurons, in the  brain. 
              Development of the proper neurotransmitters is critical to  the normal
              development of the nervous system in any animal, to  establish and regulate
              communication between the nerve cells.  This  project exploits the extremely
              simple nervous system of a tiny  roundworm, known as C. elegans, which has the
              added advantage of  allowing sophisticated genetic studies.  A gene called
              flp-1 has  been discovered to encode a group of compounds called FRMF amide- 
              like peptides that are important neurotransmitters.  This work will  use
              molecular genetic techniques to examine the control of the  transcription
              process underlying the expression of the peptides  from the gene.  The work
              will characterize the flp-1 gene, and  identify the promoter elements and genes
              that interact with flp-1,  important to the specification and regulation of
              neuropeptide  expression.  Molecular characterization of this genetic pathway
              may  yield insights into the mechanisms of how neurons are  developmentally
              programmed to express specific neurotransmitters,  and results will have impact
              across many areas of neuroscience,  genetics and developmental biology.  ***
