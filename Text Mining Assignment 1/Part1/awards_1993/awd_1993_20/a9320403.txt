Abstract    :
                      9320403  Sparke         Galaxies are widely believed to have unseen
              'dark' halos  containing much of the mass of the system.  The halo is more 
              extended than the luminous material, and its mass distribution is  best probed
              by studying the outermost orbits of stars and gas.   Models for warped disks in
              spiral galaxies, and for polar rings  around SO galaxies, show that these can
              be understood as self-  gravitating structures in the potential of the massive
              halo.  The  form expected for the warp or the polar ring, and velocities of 
              orbits within these structures, depend on how mass is distributed  within the
              unseen halo:  on the central concentration, on the  flattening normal to the
              disk plane, on whether it is significantly  triaxial.  Support will be provided
              both for theoretical modeling  and observations.  Theoretical work on warps
              will address the  effect of a galactic bulge, warps with different azimuthal 
              dependences, and the eventual damping of warps due to interaction  with the
              halo.  Optical and HI observations of warped systems will  also be made. 
              Dynamical modeling of polar rings will concentrate  on the effect of
              triaxiality, and on detailed models for particular  observed systems to
              establish parameters; the observational program  includes high-resolution HI
              mapping of the rings, radio surveys,  and optical imaging and spectroscopy
