Abstract    :
              9320733  Milgrom  In the standard theory of markets, prices coordinate a system
              in  which independent decision makers, acting in their own interest,  manage to
              use resources efficiently.  Many economic problems,  however, are characterized
              by fixed costs, indivisible goods, and  other problems, where the price system
              does not in general lead  to an efficient allocation.  Firms and whole
              societies can get  stuck at an inefficient allocation, what many economists now
              call  a coordination failure.  When such a system is characterized by  strong
              complementarities among various decisions, that structure  can sometimes be
              exploited to develop a more centralized approach  to overcome the coordination
              failure.    The broad objective of this research is to understand how firms 
              and other complex organizations can organize to improve  coordination in these
              situations.  This project will (1) develop  methods of comparative static
              analysis, (2) develop testable  implications about the organization of firms
              based on the  presence of complementarities, (3) identify the characteristics 
              of decision problems, and (4) identify the sources of resistance  to change by
              individuals and the methods by which these may be  overcome.  ***
