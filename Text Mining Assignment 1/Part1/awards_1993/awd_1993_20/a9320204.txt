Abstract    :
              9320204  Crespi       Taiwan is considered a classic example of a steady-  state
              fold-and-thrust belt in which accretion is balanced by  erosions and is the
              basis for current collision models.  The  possible presence of a syn-orogenic
              normal fault therefore  has more than local interest.  This project will
              examine the  Lishan Fault which separates two belts of relatively low 
              metamorphic (but distinctly different) grade along the axis  of the orogen. 
              Thermal maturity of the wall rocks will be  used todetermine both fault
              geometry and offset.  Results  should help understand the processes that
              contribute to the  development of synorogenic normal faults in overall 
              compressional environments.
