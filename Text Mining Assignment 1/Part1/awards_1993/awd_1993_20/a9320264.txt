Abstract    :
              Szymanski  9320264       The award will support interdisciplinary research on 
              simulating ecological systems on massively parallel computers.   The
              investigations include formalization of a probabilistic  ecological model,
              design of software tools for model  implementation and prototyping the
              developed software on sample  applications.  The software will model the impact
              of vector-borne  disease on a small community.  The model involves interactions
               among four species:  two hosts, a parasite, and a pathogen.  This  award is
              being jointly supported by the Ecology Program and the  Computational Biology
              Activities program.  ***
