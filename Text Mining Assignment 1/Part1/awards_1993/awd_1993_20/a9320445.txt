Abstract    :
              9320445  Emanuel       It is increasingly apparent that many facets of the
              tropical  climate are sensitive to cloud microphysics.  Microphysical 
              processes acting within cumulus clouds strongly control the water  vapor
              content of the surrounding atmosphere and so modulate  atmospheric
              temperatures.  Cloud microphysical processes also  influence the distribution
              and properties of stratiform clouds in  the tropics and elsewhere.  These same
              processes affect the  dynamics of large-scale flows in convecting atmospheres. 
                     The cloud parameterization schemes used in large-scale and  climate
              models are woefully inadequate and the representation of  microphysical
              processes, or lack thereof, may be responsible in  large part for this
              deficiency.  The principal investigator intends  to test the sensitivity of
              climate models to the convective  parameterizations, using the NCAR Community
              Climate Model (CCM2).   He will compare the results of simulations done with
              different  parameterizations and further test them against atmospheric 
              observations.          This project will contribute to the goals of the Role of
               Clouds, Energy, and Water in Global Climate Change effort.  ***
