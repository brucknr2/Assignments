Abstract    :
                  9320044  Holt  The posted-offer trading institution is one in which sellers
              post  prices on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.  Posted-offer results  provide a
              basis of comparison with trading in less structured  double-auction
              experiments.  This project is motivated by three  stylized facts from
              posted-offer experiments.  The first involves  explicit price-fixing
              conspiracies which can raise prices in  laboratory posted-offer settings.  The
              ineffectiveness of seller  conspiracies in comparable double-auctions motivates
              the proposed  work on whether collusion in posted-offer markets is undermined 
              by opportunities for sellers to offer private discounts.  Related  experiments
              will examine the effects of contractual restrictions  on discounting and on
              trade association reports.  A second  stylized fact is the poor response of
              posted-offer markets to  demand shocks.  One implication of this observation is
              that the  price-posting process could generate price rigidities with  Keynesian
              macroeconomic consequences.  The proposed experiments  involve simultaneous
              posting of wages and prices in a general  equilibrium framework with fiat
              money.  One goal is to study the  real effects of nominal monetary shocks.  The
              third issue arises  from the generally weak competitive tendencies of
              posted-offer  markets which suggest that prices might be raised sharply by the 
              addition of small imperfections, such as search costs.  The  proposed
              experiments will evaluate several recent theoretical  resolutions of this
              ("Diamond") paradox, i.e., that small  imperfections can produce monopoly
              prices.
