Abstract    :
              ATM-9320778  McElroy              This research project is aimed at addressing
              key issues in  stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry.  For the stratosphere,
               (1) field observations will be used to test and refine our  understanding of
              the role of heterogenous processes on the  chemistry of the lower stratosphere;
              (2) diagnostic models will be  developed and applied to elucidate the chemical
              and dynamical  mechanisms responsible for long-term trends in the ozone, with 
              particular attention to global effects of volcanic aerosols; and  (3) the role
              of denitrification will be examined as the controlling  influence on loss of
              ozone in polar regions, as part of a strategy  to clarify differences between
              ozone loss in the Arctic and  Antarctic.  For the troposphere, the PI proposes
              to: (1) data for  short-lived species from recent field expeditions will be
              used to  test and improve photochemical mechanisms; (2) to test the 
              distribution of hydroxyl radical in a global three-dimensional  Chemical Tracer
              Model (CTM) will be tested using observations of  carbon 14 labeled carbon
              monoxide; (3) the CTM will be used to test  inventory of sources for carbon
              monoxide, a key species regulating  hydroxyl radical concentrations, taking
              advantage of new data for  carbon 13 labeled carbon monoxide and carbon 18
              labeled carbon  monoxide and including additional studies of ethylene and
              acetylene  and (4) the CTM will also be used to investigate changes in the 
              oxidizing power of the troposphere from 1950 to the present.
