Abstract    :
              This proposal has two main parts.  The first is an  investigation of gedanken
              experiments associated with  interpretations of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
              program,  including issues such as the failure of locality.  The  second is
              aimed at providing new insight into our  understanding of special relativity,
              through a series of  gedanken experiments.  ***
