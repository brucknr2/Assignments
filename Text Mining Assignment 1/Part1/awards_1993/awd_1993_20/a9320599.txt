Abstract    :
               A program is proposed to evaluate the feasibility of preparing ultrapure,
              nanophase, monodispersed, spherical particles of silicon carbide in a
              combustion synthesis process.  In this process acetylene and silane are the
              "fuel" and "oxidizer" in a flame for which the products are silicon carbide
              powder and hydrogen gas.  Once the flame is ignited, eg by an electric spark,
              it continues to burn producing product.  The product is collected in a liquid
              dispersant to minimize agglomeration and to prevent oxidation of the very
              active newly formed surfaces.  The challenge is to produce a pure material with
              a negligible quantity of free carbon or free silicon which are formed in excess
              acetylene or excess silane mixtures, respectively.
