Abstract    :
              Abstract - Daoutides - 9320402    Chemical engineering processes are inherently
              nonlinear and multivariable, and are typically modeled by coupled differential
              and algebraic equations (DAEs).  The differential equations arise from dynamic
              conservation equations, while the algebraic equations arise from thermodynamic
              equilibrium relations, empirical constitutive equations, closure conditions,
              quasi-steady-state assumptions, etc.  For many chemical processes,  the
              algebraic equations are implicit and singular in nature and do not allow the
              direct reduction of the process model to one consisting of pure differential
              equations.    The objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive
              framework for the analysis and control of nonlinear multivariable DAE systems. 
              A state-space methodology framework will be adopted for this purpose and
              nonlinear analysis and synthesis tools will be used.  Fundamental insight on
              the nature of the control problem will be obtained and general control methods
              will be developed.  Software tools will also be developed and used for the
              application of the methods to representative chemical reaction and separation
              processes.
