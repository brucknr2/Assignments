Abstract    :
              9320570  Ramirez  The research proposed in this application is the study of an 
              intravascular hybrid artificial pancreas (HAP).  The HAP  consists of  a
              cylindrical inert housing enclosing a single,  tubular hollow fiber membrane in
              a shell-and-tube mass  exchanger configuration.  Islets can be inoculated into
              the  annular space through a port in the housing.  HAPs have been  shown by
              other groups to reverse experimental diabetes in  animals, but have not
              undergone clinical trials to date.  Thus, scale-up criteria based on
              engineering principles are  currently lacking.  The goal of this project is to
              attain a  more fundamental understanding of the  factors which  determine the
              efficiency and durability of insulin release  from islets seeded in a HAP
              device.  Specific aims are to:  (1) quantify the flow and solute resistance in
              vitro  provided by both the membrane and the seeded islets, (2)  quantify the
              effect of membrane protein "fouling" in vitro  on the dynamics of solute
              transport within the HAP, (3)  determine the effect of islet packing density on
              the  performance of seeded HAPS, (4) determine the glucose-  induced insulin
              response of seeded HAPS perfused with media  containing different oxygen
              concentrations, (5) test for  periods of up to 2 months the best HAP
              configurations in a  small group of pancreatectomized rhesus monkeys, and (6) 
              develop comprehensive theoretical models for analysis of the  various transport
              experiments proposed.  ***
