Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this research is to create a new class of  synthesis tools
              which address the design of complex controller-data  path machines under
              constraints of pre-defined interfaces.  Because  the results will be integrated
              with commercial EDA design tools, a  design output format, which can be
              simulated and allows automated  re-design of selected portions of the design,
              is being developed.   In a second task, approximate sequential reachability
              analysis is  being used to design and implement algorithms for optimizing and 
              partitioning controller designs.  The third task is to explore  scheduling
              algorithms for both the control and data-path portions  of the design. 
              Finally, an optimizing compiler is being built.  It  contains algorithms which
              solve encoding issues for high  performance designs, and performs re-scheduling
              of the data-path  operations to minimize required resources while maintaining
              design  behavior.
