Abstract    :
              The behavior of individuals with respect to risks to their health  or to the
              environment may be significantly affected by how they  perceive the risks. 
              This has implications for public health and  environmental policy designed to
              remedy or manage these risks.   Further, differences in risk perception may
              increase  confrontations between various groups in society or may render 
              public policy aimed at health protection and risk management  ineffective. 
              Careful, in-depth studies of distinctive social  groups and their interaction
              with health and environmental risks  can inform risk theory and promote the
              development and  implementation of more effective public policies.  This study 
              contributes to the understanding of risk perception formation and  the
              influences of psychological, social and cultural factors in  Native American
              populations, specifically, the Mvskoke of  Oklahoma.  Ethnographic methods and
              a survey instrument will be  developed that integrate psychometric and cultural
              factors in  risk perception to capture a richer framework for addressing the 
              risk responses of diverse cultural groups.
