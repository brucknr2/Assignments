Abstract    :
              9320300  Kulikowski     Wireless technology is gaining in popularity very
              rapidly.  Many predict a new emerging, gigantic market where millions of mobile
              users will carry small, battery powered palmtop based terminals with wireless
              connections. Mobile users will be in constant need of information for traffic
              directions, local directory, weather, shopping.  The wireless medium will be
              used as the "first mile" of the information highway which will disseminate
              massive amounts of information across the country.  Before this vision can be
              realized a number of challenging research problems ranging from
              telecommunications to data management and distributed systems have to be
              solved.     This award provides equipment to gain implementation experience in
              deploying Wireless Information Systems dealing with location aware or/and
              location transparent access to information resources.  Wireless infrastructure
              support is needed to understand the effects of three new aspects of wireless
              information access: (1) mobility of information consumers (and perhaps
              producers.)  (2) wireless bandwidth and (3) battery power limitations.  Methods
              of  supporting wireless services as broadcasting, triggering, ad hoc queries,
              and network-oriented services (such as ftp, telnet, X window, etc.) for mobile
              clients will be evaluated and these services over wide areas and regardless of
              client mobility and disconnection will be supported.      This equipment will
              help to  set up a wireless laboratory.  With the infrastructure in place,
              experiments can be conducted to determine the suitability and performance of
              the proposed  concepts, algorithms, and prot ocols and report on the experience
              of supporting network-oriented information services in a wireless environment.
