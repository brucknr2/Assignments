Abstract    :
              9320426  Sivjee  This award is for joint radar and optical investigations of the
               interactions between the atmospheric constituents in the polar  thermosphere
              and precipitating auroral electrons.  The latter  dissipate most of their
              energy through a combination of processes  involving dissociation, excitation
              and ionization of some of the  upper atmospheric constituents.  In turn, the
              byproducts of these  processes interact with ambient air particles to modify
              polar  thermospheric composition and thermodynamics.  All these upper 
              atmospheric auroral processes can be investigated by combining  ground-based
              remote sensing measurements of auroral ionization  profiles using incoherent
              scatter radar (ISR) sounding of the  auroral region, and concurrent
              bore-sighted spectroscopic and  interferometric observations of the optical
              signatures of the  auroral electron excitation of N2, O2, O and N.  The data
              base for  these studies will be constructed from the ISR and Spectro- 
              interferometric observations of auroral displays occurring over 
              Sondrestromfjord in Greenland.  ***
