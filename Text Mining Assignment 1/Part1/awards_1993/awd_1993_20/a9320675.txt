Abstract    :
              9320675  Stearns          This is a project designed to help us understand  when
               and  why  upsurges in corporate mergers take  place  in  the  American
              economy.  Goverment documents, the business  press,  and  other  sources  of 
              data  will  be  used  to  test   an  explanation drawn from resource
              mobilization theory in order  to  explain these merger movement upsurges.  All
              four of the  peaks  of  corporate  merger activity in  the  last  century 
              (circa 1897, 1929, 1968, and 1985) will be examined in light  of this theory.  
                   Up until now the periodic upsurges of corporate merger  activity  in  the
              United States have been seen  as  akin  to  earthquakes  or 
              hurricanes--unpredictable  and   mysterious  events  that wreak havoc on a wide
              scale.  Case  studies  of  individual mergers abound, but these contribute
              little to an  understanding of why mergers are common in some periods  and 
              rare  in  others.   To  the  extent  that  this  project  is  successful, it
              will make upsurges in corporate mergers  less  mysterious and more
              interpretable.  Those who feel  that  at  their peaks such merger movements
              generate substantial waste  and  disruption  should  find  that  this  project 
              provides  information that can be used to moderate these problems.  ***
