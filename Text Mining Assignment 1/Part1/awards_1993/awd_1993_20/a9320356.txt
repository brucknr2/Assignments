Abstract    :
              REMPI Photoelectron spectroscopy is used to measure the  amplitudes, phase
              shifts and signs of the phase shifts in  NO.  Extensions of research via
              modifications of the  experimental apparatus will enable the complete 
              determination of the scattering matrix and extend the  approach to a much wider
              class of molecules.  This will  bring our understanding of the photoionization
              of molecules  to the level that we now understand atomic photoionization.
