Abstract    :
              9320589  Shemansky  In the upper atmosphere of the Earth, the energy budget is 
              controlled by both particle collision processes and direct  interaction of
              solar radiation.  In response to the need for  accurate atomic and molecular
              properties in order to understand the  processes, the University of Southern
              California (USC) and the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the Calfiornia
              Institute of  Technology have established a program which combines laboratory 
              measurements and non-linear modeling of excitation reactions.  The  present
              award will continue in the examination of species critical  to the
              understanding of the observed phenomena.  Crossed beam  excitation and
              photoabsorption measurements will be used to define  accurate excitation cross
              sections and other basic atomic and  molecular properties such as
              predissociation fractions required for  atmospheric models.  Calculations of
              the combined detailed  collisional and radiative non-linear volumetric
              processes will be  produced for utilization by the larger atmospheric models
              that  other researchers have established.  In this three-year renewal  task
              plan USC-JPL will concentrate on the species: N2, O2, NO, N, O,  H, and their
              ions the most abundant atomic and molecular species in  the upper atmosphere
              and the species ubiquitously observed by earth  orbiting satellites (RAIDS,
              DMSP, Polar Bear, HUP, SMEX, Aura)  equipped with UV sensors.  In addition for
              UV calibration purposes  in laboratory and spaceflight instrumentation the
              target gas H2 will  be reexamined to resolve cross section discrepancies.  To
              carry out  the measurements JPL will utilize three fully operational UV 
              spectrometers, including the highest resolution single scattering  UV
              instrument in the U.S., a new 3m high resolution spectrometer (         =
              67000) with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and vacuum  ultraviolet (FUV) array
              detectors.  ***
