Abstract    :
              9320153  Katz  Under and SGER award an attempt will be made to solve the problem
               of nozzle wear in abrasive slurry jet cutting operations by  lubricating the
              interior nozzle surface from a pressurized  reservoir located on the outside of
              the porous nozzle material.  A two dimensional apparatus will be constructed to
              allow detailed  observation of individual particle movements as an aid in 
              determining optimal process and design parameters.  ***
