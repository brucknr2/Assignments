Abstract    :
              9320769  Tu    This program provides a systematic research effort on
              tin-bismuth-  antimony-based solders.  Their wetting behavior on copper and 
              silica/chromium/copper/gold surfaces is measured and compared to  lead-tin
              solders.  The science of instability at the wetting tip  due to dynamic
              interfacial reaction between the liquid solder and  the solid copper is
              emphasized in this study.  For this purpose  cross-sectional transmission
              electron microscopy of the reaction at  the wetting tip using thin film samples
              is employed.  Also solder  wetting on single crystal surfaces of copper is
              examined.  This  wetting behavior is the most important processing parameter in
              the  selection of lead-free solder for electronic packaging.  Both low  melting
              point (about 180C) and high melting point (about 300C)  lead-free solders will
              be studied.  %%%  The lead-based solder used in microelectronic devices is an 
              environment issue.  For environmental conscious manufacturing lead  replacement
              and reliable lead-free solders are urgent issues.    ***
