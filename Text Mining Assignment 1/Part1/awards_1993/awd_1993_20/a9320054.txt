Abstract    :
              9320054  Hiltner    This "TIE" project funds a research project to be performed
              jointly  by Case Western Reserve University's Industry/University  Cooperative
              Research Center for Applied Polymers Research and the  State University of New
              York - Buffalo's Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for
              Biosurfaces.  This project is a  collaborative study of surface interactions
              that will lead to an  elucidation of relationships between biomaterial surface
              properties  and blood protein and monocyte/macrophage adhesion and activation. 
               The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Applied  Polymers will
              be responsible for the biological characterization  both before and following
              protein adsorption.  The  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Biosurfaces  will be responsible for surface characterization both before and 
              following protein adsorption and cell adhesion.    The researchers are very
              well qualified to perform this joint  project.    Additional funding is
              provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's  Environmental Restoration and
              Waste Management Office to obtain a  non-voting membership in the
              Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center for Applied Polymers Research.
                 The Program Manager recommends Case Western Reserve University be  awarded
              $25,000 for the first year of a two-year continuing award.   An additional
              $10,000 is recommended for one year with funding  provided by the U.S.
              Department of Energy.
