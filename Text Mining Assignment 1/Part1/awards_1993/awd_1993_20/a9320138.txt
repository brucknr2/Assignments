Abstract    :
              9320138  Dubowsky  This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research, 
              supports  preliminary investigation of the potential role of robotics in  field
              conservation, restoration, and preservation, using as a  demonstration the
              exploration and later restoration of the historic  Navy vessel, the USS
              Constitution.  Thi effort seeks to determine  appropriate design approaches for
              multirobot systems to be used in  making measurements, detecting defects, and
              ultimately  participating in repair and restoration operations, and to identify
               basic problems facing such robotic applications.  Questions include  modes of
              cooperation, communication demands, sensing demands, need  for minimalist
              computing, and need for separate systems for  inspection and remediation.  The
              project is expected to yield  valuable insights into the appropriate design and
              employment of  robots for such field conservation and restoration operations,
              and  also should lead to a highly-visible demonstration of robotic 
              capabilities in less-structured environments.  9It might also make  a good test
              of practical potential of the Brooksian approach to  multirobot architecture). 
              The PI will be working with  conservators, conservation scientists, and the
              Naval Historian for  the Constitution, and the overall operations will be
              guided by an  advisory panel.
