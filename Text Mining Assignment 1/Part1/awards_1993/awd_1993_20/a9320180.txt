Abstract    :
              9320180  Henry      Software reuse is the key to increasing productivity within 
              the software development process.  By reusing existing  software, time and
              effort are saved in the testing and  maintenance phases of a software product. 
              The goals of this  research involve the measurement of reusability of software 
              in the object oriented paradigm and the investigation how  the process of reuse
              fits into the overall software  development lifecycle.  The effects of reuse on
              software  development are also being accessed.  In particular, what  costs are
              involved in retraining programmers to think about  reuse, to learn the object
              oriented paradigm, and to know  what reusable routines are available and how to
              use them.  Specifically, the goals of this research are:  (1) to 
              quantitatively measure object oriented designs and relate  them to aspects of
              the final code (complexity, reusability,  readability); (2) to identify the
              measurable qualities of  reusable software (costs, benefits); (3) to correlate 
              various aspects of reusability with programmer  characteristics; (4) to measure
              the effects of reusing  software on the process of software development
              (design,  coding, integration, testing, maintenance).    These goals are sought
              through an empirical study conducted  in a controlled academic environment. 
              After analysis and  refinement of the new suite of metrics, final validation 
              would involve one or more software vendors in another study  usilg production
              software systems and maintenance data.  ***
