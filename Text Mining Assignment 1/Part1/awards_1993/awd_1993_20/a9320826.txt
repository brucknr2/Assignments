Abstract    :
              9320826  Borjas  The large number of immigrants admitted into the U.S. over the 
              past two decades has had a major impact on the skill composition  of the labor
              force, and might even be responsible for some of the  major changes in the wage
              structure observed in the 1980s.  It is  important to stress, however, that the
              economic impact of today's  immigration is not limited to the current
              generation.  Because of  the intergenerational link between the skills of
              parents and  children, current immigration policy might already be determining 
              the skill endowment of the labor force for the next two or three  generations. 
                The purpose of this research is to determine and analyze the role  that
              immigration and ethnicity play in the U.S. economy.  The  underlying theme of
              the various aspects of this project is that  immigration has both short and
              long-run effects, and that these  effects are much better understood by
              grounding the analysis in a  solid microeconomic, theoretical foundation.  The
              empirical  analysis will use a number of data sets, including the newly 
              released 1990 Public Use Sample of the U.S. Census, the National  Longitudinal
              Surveys, and the General Social Surveys.  ***
