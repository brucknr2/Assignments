Abstract    :
              9320692  Nieves       Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will 
              focus on the behavior of neutrinos when they are inside a  material medium. 
              Topics will include the propagation, evolution,  and electromagnetic properties
              of neutrinos in media.  This work  is very important to our understanding of
              the behavior of  neutrinos in ordinary stars and in supernova explosions.  ***
