Abstract    :
              9320057  Baier    This "TIE" project funds a research project to be performed
              jointly  by Case Western Reserve University's Industry/University  Cooperative
              Research Center for Applied Polymers Research and the  State University of New
              York at Buffalo's Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for
              Biosurfaces.  This project is a  collaborative study of surface interactions
              that will lead to an  elucidation of relationships between biomaterial surface
              properties  and blood protein and monocyte/macrophage adhesion and activation. 
               The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Applied  Polymers will
              be responsible for the biological characterization  both before and following
              protein adsorption.  The  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Biosurfaces  will be responsible for surface characterization both before and 
              following protein adsorption and cell adhesion.    The researchers are very
              well qualified to perform this joint  project.    The Program Manager
              recommends the State University of New York at  Buffalo be awarded $25,000 for
              the first year of a two-year  continuing award.
