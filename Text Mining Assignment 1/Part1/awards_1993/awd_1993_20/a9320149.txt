Abstract    :
              9320149  COMAROFF, John  COMAROFF, Jean  This project will examine the various
              forms of resistance that  arose among black South Africans, and especially the
              Southern  Tswana peoples, in response to colonial overrule, 1830-1920; it  will
              also explore how these forms of resistance laid a basis for  present-day
              struggles toward democracy.  The study, which will  have a strongly comparative
              focus, conceives of "resistance" as  an ensemble of strategies, a continuum
              ranging from everyday acts  of refusal through dramas of alterity, carnivals of
              terror,  rebellions and social movements, to formal political  organizations.  
               In exploring the conditions under which black South Africans have  defied
              those who rule them, and in describing the means by which  they have done so,
              the study seeks to answer a number of  questions about the nature of
              resistance.  In what circumstances  do disempowered peoples seek remedy and
              redress in the law?  When  and why do they resort to other means, means either
              illegal or  alegal?  Do some forms of insubordination encourage or preclude 
              others?  What is the role of consciousness and intention in the  motivation of
              protest--and in determining its historical  significance?  Is it possible to
              move beyond a purely reactive  view of defiance to grasp the active cultural
              construction of its  means and ends?  How do we understand the roles of social
              class,  ethnicity, race, gender, and generation in resistance?    The
              investigation will involve the analysis of documentary  sources, supplemented
              by interviews, in Southern Africa and  Britain.  The product will be a book,
              the third in a large-scale  study of the social and political effects of
              colonialism.
