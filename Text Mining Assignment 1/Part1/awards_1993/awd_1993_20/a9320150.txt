Abstract    :
              9320150  Sozen  This project will investigate the effect on frame response  of
              two parameters:  (a) high-strength concrete and (b)  column yielding. Physical
              data to support the currently  existing hypotheses about the effects of high
              strength  concrete and column yielding are lacking. Although the two 
              parameters are of different classes (one a material property  and the other a
              design option), lack of general theoretical  understanding in either case leads
              to the same effect of  constricting choices in earthquake-resistant design of 
              reinforced concrete buildings.    The proposed ten test specimens of reinforced
              column-girder  assemblies have been designed to capture the essential  features
              of reinforced concrete frames responding to  earthquake excitation primarily in
              the plane of the frame.  Sizes, materials, and loading rates will be selected
              to  reduce scale effects to a minimum within the limits of the  experimental
              facilities.  The experimental variables are (1)  Concrete strength, nominally
              5,000 and 10, 000 psi; (2)  axial unit stress in column, 850 and 1700 psi or
              one half of  "balanced load", and (3) location of yielding, in the column  or
              in the girder.    The research is expected to provide:  (1) direct conclusions 
              about the effects of the test variables; (2) testing of the  currently
              available hysteresis algorithms using the data  from the investigation; (3)
              development, if necessary, of  new hysteresis algorithms to reflect the
              observed  deformations of the column, the girder, and the joint; (4) 
              definition of the domains of confident applicability for the  hysteresis
              algorithms tested or developed; (5) parametric  studies of the effects of
              concrete strength and column  yielding on frame response to serve as the base
              for  development of simple design procedures; (6) recommendations  of design
              procedures with defined limits of applicability.  ***
