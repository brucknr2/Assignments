Abstract    :
              9320387  Prober    This funding supports a program to investigate a new type of 
              detector for the frequency range from 600 GHz to 3000 GHz.  The  device
              utilizes a small superconducting microbridge biased at its  transition
              temperature as a thermal heterodyne mixer.   Analysis of  the concept predicts
              that the device should have an intermediate  frequency bandwidth of 1 to 4 GHz.
               Response at large intermediate  frequencies is expected by the rapid diffusion
              of hot electrons  from the microbridge.  ***
