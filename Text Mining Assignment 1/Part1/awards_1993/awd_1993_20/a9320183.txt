Abstract    :
              9320183  WEIKLE    This research program will investigate methods for improving
              the  performance of submillimeter Schottky receivers and reducing the 
              requirement for high-power THz local oscillator sources through the  use of
              planar, surface-channel diodes and subharmonic mixing.   Schottky diodes
              operating above 1 THz will be integrated into  quasi-optical structures that
              permit the use of lower-frequency,  relatively low-power local oscillators. 
              The RF properties of  different diode geometries and integrated planar antennas
              will also  be studied.  This program is expected to result in more reliable 
              Schottky diode receivers with reduced local oscillator requirements  at THz
              frequencies.   This development will help to open up this  important region of
              the spectrum for millimeter wave imaging,  radar, atmospheric chemistry, and
              monitoring of atmospheric ozone.
