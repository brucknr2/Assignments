Abstract    :
              9320481    The Internet is a worldwide network of networks.  As of May 1993  it
              connects over 10,000 different networks, comprising over 1.5  million separate
              computers.  Traffic on the NSFNET backbone to  the Internet (the largest but
              not the only backbone) has been  growing at about 11% per month over the last
              five years; this  means it has been doubling every seven months.  The Internet
              is  considered to be the model for the National Research and  Education Network
              (NREN) that is the focus of the $5 billion HPCC  program adopted by Congress in
              1992.  Important policy decisions  are already being made about the
              commercialization and  privatization of the Internet backbones, regulation of 
              transmission providers and information service providers, the  protection of
              intellectual property in electronic form, and  public access to information
              infrastructure.  These decisions are  being made with little input from
              economists.  This project will  clarify the economic context for wide-area data
              networks: costs,  pricing, investment, and growth.  It examines competition and
               industry structure, and address the important regulatory  questions that
              follow as data, telephone and video technologies  and markets begin to merge. 
              Furthermore it develops mechanisms  for efficient resource allocation in such
              networks.
