                  Salmons are well known for their ability to return to the stream in which
              they were born.  The sensory basis for this remarkable behavior is olfactory: 
              during a sensitive developmental period (smolt transformation), salmon imprint
              to distinctive homestream odors, and adults later use this odorant memory as a
              migratory cue to guide them back from the open ocean to their natal streams.  
              How salmon imprint to homestream odors has remained an important but perplexing
              puzzle for over forty years.  Proponents of olfactory imprinting have assumed
              that the olfactory memory for the home stream resides in the central nervous
              system.  Dr. Roberts, however, proposes that olfactory memory is actually
              retained in the olfactory receptor cells themselves.  The basis for his theory
              rests on two important findings.  First, surges in plasma thyroxine levels
              mediate smolting, and second, olfactory imprinting coincides with this
              developmental metamorphosis.  This small grant for exploratory research enables
              Dr. Roberts to use state of the art electrophysiological and neuroanatomical
              techniques to determine whether there are thyroxine induced change s in
              olfactory receptor neurons to specific odors.  This basic research will have
              direct benefits to Pacific salmon by providing insight into how olfactory
              imprinting might be artificially manipulated.  If thyroxine hormone can
              influence the ability of fish to imprint during a wider time frame than
              smolting, this finding could markedly advance conservation efforts aimed at
              transporting rapidly diminishing endangered salmon runs to healthier river
              systems.   ***
