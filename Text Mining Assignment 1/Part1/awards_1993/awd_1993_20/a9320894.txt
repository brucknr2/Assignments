Abstract    :
              9320894  Case  The aim of this research is to investigate the determinants of 
              state policy choices and to consider the interplay between the  economic causes
              and effects of such policies.  Many recent papers  have exploited cross state
              variation in policies, in order to  identify the effects of a state policy
              change on some economic  outcome variable of interest.  For example, the fact
              that states  have different minimum wages and that these wage floors change at 
              different points in time provides a means of investigating the  effect of
              minimum wages on unemployment.  Such cases are often  referred to as "natural
              experiments".  The goal in this project  is to clarify the value of this
              approach, distinguishing cases  where it is applicable from those where it is
              not,  The data that  will be used are drawn from a state data base for the
              United  States assembled by the authors for a forty year period (1950 to  1990)
              and used in their prior work.  They will also use data from  the out-going
              rotation groups of the CPS.  The latter constitutes  a novel approach to
              empirically investigating political economy  questions.  ***
