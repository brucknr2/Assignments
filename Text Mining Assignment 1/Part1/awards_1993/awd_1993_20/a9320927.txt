Abstract    :
               The PI will investigate an ongoing innovation project at Xerox Corporation's
              Palo Alto Research Center.   The innovation is "Workspace," which integrates
              computers, monitors, cameras, and other media.  This innovation allows ad hoc
              groups to be formed even if the members of the group are situated in different
              geographical locations.   The research program will concern factors that may
              inhibit or facilitate innovation.  First, what organizational forms are
              conducive to innovation? Second, is there a benefit of organizational forms
              that allow individuals to address issues that concern social and ethical
              values?  The PIs will use a variety of data sources in order to test their
              hypotheses concerning the innovation process.  These sources include company
              documentation, ethnographic data, and a "field stimulation" approach in which
              discussions are used to examine participants' reactions to various aspects of
              the innovation process.
