Abstract    :
              9320326   Mountain          The cochlea is the complex structure in the inner
              ear that  contains an elastic membrane, the basilar membrane, which  oscillates
              in response to sound.  The oscillations stimulate  mechanosensory cells called
              hair cells, which send signals to the  auditory nerve.  A remarkable finding
              around 15 years ago showed  that one group of hair cells, the outer hair cells,
              can themselves  show motility, and so act as electromechanical elements that
              can  modulate cochlear sensitivity.  As a byproduct of that function,  the
              outer hair cell activity is transmitted as acoustical energy  back out of the
              ear, producing measurable sounds called otoacoustic  emissions, which have been
              used by scientists and clinicians as a  non-invasive tool to study cochlear
              function.  This project uses  electrophysiology, computer simulation, and
              measurements of the  otoacoustic emissions to examine several novel hypotheses
              about how  the basilar membrane vibration and the outer hair cell activity may 
              be involved in normal cochlear function.  It will specifically  evaluate where
              the non-linearities in amplification occur in the  cochlea, and whether the
              basilar membrane may have modes of  oscillation different from the classical
              traveling-wave form.   Results from this unique combined physiological and
              modeling  approach will have an impact on all auditory neuroscience, and  novel
              findings will have important impact not only on handling of  hearing disorders,
              but on design of auditory communications, and on  biomechanics and
              bioengineering.  ***
