Abstract    :
              9320037  Leonov    A combination of theoretical and experimental research will
              be  conducted to describe secondary laminar flow of viscoelastic  fluids in
              channels with non-circular cross-sections.  Rectangular, elliptical, and
              trapezoidal sections are to be  imvestigated. The theoretical models for the
              fluid will be the  Giesekus model and one developed by the Principal
              Investigator.  The numerical simulation will be with Finite Elements. The 
              experiments will be with several non-Newtonian liquids, to be  rheologically
              characterized. Measurements will be with LDV and  birefringence techniques.    
              Secondary flow can occur in internal flow passages such as occur  in molding
              and extrusion of polymeric materials. It affects  processing pressures and the
              final shape of manufactured parts.  ***
