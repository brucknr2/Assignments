Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Lou/ATM-9320357         This project will focus on
              magnetohydrodynamic physical  processes likely to be involved in solar
              chromospheric and coronal  activity.  The research is a continuation of past
              efforts to  understand the mechanisms by which waves generated in the 
              convective zones of stars propagate into the magnetized outer  atmospheric
              layers, and the physical effects arising from this wave  propagation.  Specific
              goals of this continuation are:  (1) to  model the extended heating of the
              inner solar wind via resonant  absorption of Alfven waves; (2) to construct
              analytical models for  the reflection and transmission of Alfven waves in
              inhomogeneous  atmospheres, all outside the WKB approximation; and (3) to
              develop  numerical experiments for the simulation of both resonant  absorption
              and reflection of Alfven waves, and compare results from  these experiments to
              the analytical results.
