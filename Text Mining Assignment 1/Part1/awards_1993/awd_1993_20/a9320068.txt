Abstract    :
                      9320068  Lovelace         There are important fundamental unsolved
              problems in  astrophysics such as supernova explosions, formation and 
              propagation of stellar and extragalactic jets, formation of stars  and compact
              objects where rotation and magnetic fields are  significant.  A rigorous
              understanding of these rotating magnetized  systems can be obtained only as a
              result of systematic development  of one, two, and three dimensional
              magneto-hydrodynamical models  and corresponding computer simulation codes.  In
              this proposal the  Principal Investigators plan to treat a number of
              astrophysical  problems based partly on advanced 2D computer codes created at
              the  M.V. Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics at Moscow University,  and
              on codes developed at Cornell University.              The collaboration of
              scientists at the Space Research  Institute (IKI) in Moscow and Cornell began
              more than two years  ago, and several joint papers have been published.  They
              have now  involved applied mathematicians in the project, and several  computer
              codes have been created and successfully tested on small,  personal computers
              in Russia and the U.S.  However, to obtain the  physically interesting results,
              much longer calculations on the  larger computers and supercomputers are
              needed.  This research will  enhance the interactions between scientists in the
              U.S. and Russia  and will lead to advances in our understanding of magneto- 
              rotational phenomena in astrophysics which may have practical  laboratory
              applications.
