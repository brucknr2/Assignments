Abstract    :
              Czys       The objective of this research is a laboratory investigation 
              designed to test the hypothesis that collisions between supercooled  water
              drops can produce ice nucleation.  The experiments will be  conducted using
              existing facilities at the Illinois State Water  Survey and the vertical wind
              tunnel at UCLA.
