              Proposal: 9320619 ABSTRACT Date:   10/27/93   PI: Garcia-Garabay U. Cal. Los
              Angeles    A systematic investigation of the chemistry of phenyl-alkyl  
              carbene derivatives in organic molecular crystals will be   made. Carbenes will
              be generated in the solid state both   thermally and photochemically by the
              extrusion of molecular   nitrogen from phenyl alkyl diazo compounds. The study
              will   include pure crystalline solids and mixed molecular   crystals, and will
              combine techniques from photochemistry,   solid state chemistry, and material
              science. Product studies   and rates of reactions will be followed as a
              function of   crystal and molecular structures, which will be determined   by
              X-ray crystallographic analyses. Correlations will be   sought for crystal and
              molecular structural features with   product selectivity and specificity. Bulk
              magnetic   properties will be measured to determine if ordered spin-  spin
              interactions occur, which would lead to ferromagnetic   behavior.    This grant
              from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   work of Professor Miguel
              Garcia-Garabay at the University of   California, Los Angeles. Carbenes, which
              are divalent   species rather than the usual tetravalent carbon molecules,  
              will be studied in the solid state. Various carbenes will be   produced both
              thermally and by light irradiation by the   extrusion of molecular nitrogen
              from precursor molecules.   Crystal structures of these precursor molecules
              will be   determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis and the   products and
              rates of these reactions will be correlated   with the crystal and molecular
              structure. These studies will   provide insight to carbene chemistry and solid
              state   chemistry.
