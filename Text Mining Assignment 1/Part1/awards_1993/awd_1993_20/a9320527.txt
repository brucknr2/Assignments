Abstract    :
              9320527  Bergstrom  Economists usually assume that people are completely 
              selfish, though when pressed, we are usually willing to  admit that parents
              seem to love their children and perhaps  each other. This research develops
              evolutionary models of  human behavior to guide an understanding about the
              amount  and type of benevolence and conflict to be expected between  siblings,
              between parents and offspring and among other  relatives. The research draws on
              the literature of  evolutionary biologists and cultural anthropologists to 
              motivate the development of the economic models.        As has been observed by
              evolutionary biologists,  individuals whose genes tell them to be generous to
              their  relatives are likely to be beneficiaries  of actions by  relatives who
              share copies of the same genes. The same kind  of reasoning that applies to
              genetic evolution can be  applied to the evolution of culture and learned
              behavior.  Much as we have biological parents and biological siblings,  we also
              have "cultural siblings"--those who learned their  behaviors from the same role
              models as ourselves.This  research project explores the logic of evolution as
              applied  to genetically and culturally determined behavior towards  ones
              relatives and neighbors. The study pays particular  attention to the question
              of how much unselfish cooperation  we would expect to see, given the
              evolutionary history of  our species.  ***
