Abstract    :
              9320672  McIntosh         The objective of this research is the deployment of an
               airborne doppler polarimetric 95 GHz (3.2 mm) radar on the  University of
              Wyoming King Air for the purpose of depicting the  microphysical structure and
              evolution of water substance in clouds.   During the first year, the radar will
              participate in the WISP  experiment (Central Colorado) which is designed to
              explore the  distribution and evolution of ice and supercooled water in 
              stationary (wave) clouds.  Additional field experiments will be  identified
              during the second and third years.  The new measurements  should provide new
              techniques to discriminate between water and  ice, measure the vertical motion
              of ice crystals in cirrus clouds  and perhaps a means of estimating crystal
              habitat.  ***
