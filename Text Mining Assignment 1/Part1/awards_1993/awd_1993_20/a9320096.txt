Abstract    :
              Foraging behavior is a critical aspect of animal survival.  Its interactions
              with the environment are complex and multi-dimensional.  Computer simulation
              holds the promise of helping laboratory biologists and field ecologists gain
              insights into behavioral mechanisms as well as theoretical models of foraging. 
              The use of simulation in research on foraging behavior is in its infancy; there
              is great potential for its use in representation and interpretation of actual
              and simulated experiments.    Phase I research resulted in a proof-of-concept
              foraging-behavior simulation model for personal computers.  The goal of Phase
              II is to investigate simulation techniques for a range of behaviors, models,
              and theories that represent the scope of research on foraging behavior.  The
              approach is to evaluate simulation techniques for such foraging concepts as
              learning, motivation, utility, herbivory, predation, risk-preference/aversion,
              and fitness.  The work will include development of a user-friendly interface
              that includes on-line help for setting up biologically valid simulations.  This
              project will require original research on the question of how to reconcile
              diverse approaches to foraging behavior.
