Abstract    :
              9320666  MERSHON   This collaborative project investigates how coalitions are
              formed  on the U.S. Supreme Court.  A particular focus is the process by  which
              opinions are written, often including many drafts and  various shifts in
              position as the doctrines that could decide a  case are debated among the
              members of the Court.  The proposed  research has scientific significance for
              two reasons. First, by  emphasizing the policies and doctrine enunciated by the
              Court  through its opinions, rather than simply counting votes on  winning and
              losing sides, the project refocuses the scientific  study of the American legal
              system.  Second, the project expands  the field of coalition analysis by
              examining an institution  composed of non-elected officials instead of
              legislatures and  political parties.    To test the model of opinion coalition,
              the project calls for the  collection of data from two sources: the official
              records of the  Supreme Court of the United States and the collected papers of 
              five justices, spanning from Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite to  Associate
              Justice Thurgood Marshall.  Specific information culled  from these sources
              includes: the policies at issue, the tentative  and final votes of the
              justices, the size and composition of  opinion coalitions, the number of
              opinion drafts, and the length  of time between votes on the merits and final
              opinions.  ***
