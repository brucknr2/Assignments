Abstract    :
              9320820  Edwards    This research examines women's labor supply decisions 
              concerning whether to engage in market work within the home  or in an office or
              other place of business outside of the  home--on-site work. The study uses data
              from the 1990 Census  of Population to analyze the determinants of women's
              choices  of work location. The study also examines the effect of a  women's
              choice of work site and work hours on her wage. The  results of this study has
              important implications for the  growth of the labor force and the tradeoffs
              women face  between work and family. The findings will also contribute  to our
              understanding of some critical child care issues.  ***
