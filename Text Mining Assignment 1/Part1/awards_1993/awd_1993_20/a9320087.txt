Abstract    :
              9320087  Holtz  This project is an analytical and experimental investigation of 
              the seismic stability of geosynthetically-reinforced earth  slopes.  The
              objectives are to: (1) increase the understanding of  the fundamental seismic
              behavior of geosynthetically-reinforced  earth slopes, and (2) develop
              realistic analytical models for the  seismic design of such structures.   
              Nonlinear dynamic finite element analyses are used to evaluate  the influence
              of material, geometric, and loading  characteristics, as well as ground motion
              parameters, on the  performance of steep (defined as greater that 2:1) 
              geosynthetically-reinforced slopes.    Models of reinforced slopes will be
              built and tested under  simulated seismic loading conditions using a dynamic
              geotechnical  centrifuge and a large shaking table, in order to understand 
              governing failure mechanisms and critical engineering properties  operative
              during earthquake ground shaking.  Existing analysis  and design methods for
              static stability will be appropriately  modified to treat seismic loading in a
              rational way, so that  geosynthetic-reinforced slopes can be designed with
              increased  confidence and economy.    This research has important implications
              for residential and  commercial land development in seismically-active regions.
