Abstract    :
              9320536  Hill  This project is on research to determine the properties of one 
              lipase, or a mixture of lipases, immobilized on various supports,  including
              hollow fibers.  This involves experimental studies of  the rates at which
              immobilized lipases bring about change in the  compositions of fats and oils
              via hydrolysis reactions which  produce fatty acids and lower glycerides, or
              via  interesterification reactions which involve an initial hydrolysis  step
              followed by esterification.  The experimental data will be  used to develop
              models of the enzyme reactors which can be used  for process design and
              optimization.  This research has potential  significance for the food industry.
