Abstract    :
              9320070  Baross  This project is on research for the  isolation and growth of
              new  thermophilic bacteria, and the  characterization of enzymes for  known and
              novel biotransformations.   This project will also continue  on-going studies
              for understanding  the basis of enzyme thermostability.   A secondary goal is
              the assessment  of the biotechnology and engineering  aspects.  The research
              team which  will perform this work is made up of  a chemical engineer, a
              biochemist,  and a microbiologist.  ***
