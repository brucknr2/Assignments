Abstract    :
              9320308  Stegeman  A broad research program is proposed.  1) Establish
              experimentally  and theoretically the basic physics of cascading;  2) Fabricate
               waveguides suitable for implementing cascading effects;  3)  Investigate
              all-optical features needed for an optical transistor  such as modulation, gain
              etc. in waveguides;  4) Investigate all-  optical switching using cascading in
              waveguides.    The experimental program will be implemented in both bulk media
              and  waveguides.  Cascading interactions will first be studied in bulk 
              crystals using Gaussian beams to establish the basic science.   Standard second
              order crystals will be used and will require high  power lasers (which we
              have).  In parallel our poled polymer  waveguide technology will be developed
              towards phase-matched SHG.   Then, using such waveguides we will investigate
              low power cascading  operations, working towards an optical transistor.  The
              PI's expect  that after three years they should be able to assess whether the 
              cascading approach is useful for signal processing in general, and  an optical
              transistor in particular.  ***
