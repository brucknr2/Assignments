Abstract    :
              9320407  Shapiro  University of Idaho  Dr. Pamela Shapiro, Chemistry Department,
              University of Idaho, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program for an investigation of
              cyclopentadienyl-aluminum and boron compounds as ligands for transition metals.
              Early transition metal bent-metallocenes in which a group 13 moiety is a
              substituent on or a bridging group between cyclopentadienyl rings will be
              prepared. These Lewis acid  sites are expected to enhance the reactivity of the
              transition metal complex toward polar substrates and increase the ability of
              the complexes to serve as olefin polymerization catalysts. Consequently, their
              reactivity with a variety of small molecules will be investigated.  A number of
              important industrial chemical processes which are catalyzed by transition metal
              compounds also employ a main-group,   often aluminum, compound as a
              co-catalyst. In this project compounds which contain both the transition- and
              main-group metal  portions will be prepared. They will then be investigated to
              determine their ability to mediate the reactions of small molecules and to
              serve as polymerization catalysts.
