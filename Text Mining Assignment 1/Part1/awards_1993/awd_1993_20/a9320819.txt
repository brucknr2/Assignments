Abstract    :
              9320819  BILSBORROW       The goal of this research is to investigate the
              factors  influencing land use and deforestation by migrant settlers  in the
              rainforest of the Ecuadorian Amazon. This area, which  is considered to be one
              of the world's "hot spots" in terms  of its rich biodiversity, is now
              undergoing massive human  intervention in the form of agricultural colonization
              by  spontaneous flows of migrants along roads built by petroleum  companies.
              Currently, the conflicting aims of protecting the  environment and economically
              developing the country are  dramatically apparent; satellite photos of the
              region taken  over the past decade vividly show rapid deforestation. This 
              project builds on a previous grant from NSF which was used  to collect critical
              information from 419 colonist  households. This project will analyze those data
              using Tobit  estimation procedures to explain the proportion of settlers' 
              lands devoted to different categories of land use. These  proportions will be
              explained using three major sets of  variables: (1) household demographic and
              socio-economic  characteristics, (2) natural resource conditions on the  farm,
              and (3) the policy and institutional context.       This research will provide
              important new insights into  the factors influencing the behavior of colonists
              in one of  the world's most important and sensitive environments. Thus  it will
              contribute to our basic understanding of the  interaction of factors in a
              developing area with a deep  tension between environmental preservation and
              economic  development. Results of the research should contribute to  the
              development of more appropriate policies to promote  sustainable development in
              the region.
