Abstract    :
              9320042   Staman       CICNet, a midlevel network supplying high level
              connectivity  to the universities of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation
               (CIC) (which includes the universities of Ohio State, Michigan  State,
              University of Michigan, Indiana University, University of  Chicago, Purdue
              University, University of Illinois, Northwestern  University, University of
              Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, and  University of Iowa) and establishing
              cooperative working  agreements with state networks in its region, requests
              support  for a major initiative of providing ubiquitous access to the 
              Internet.        Although the phrase "rural datafication" has been used to 
              describe this project succinctly, the primary focus of this  project is to
              extend Internet access and all the services it   provides to under-served
              constituencies wherever they may be  located in rural and geographically remote
              areas.       The project will focus on three key areas: 1) selecting and 
              proving standard hardware and software that can handle dial-up  and dedicated,
              low-speed internet connections; 2) high quality  documentation, training, and
              associated materials that will  reduce the amount of effort and time to connect
              participants; and  3) expanding network connections and services to
              traditionally  difficult to reach and difficult to serve user communities.  ***
