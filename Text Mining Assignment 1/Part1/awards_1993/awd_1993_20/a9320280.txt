              9320280 Pilkey This project will produce two books outlining the multiple
              geologic         ?       hazards of Alaska and Puerto Rico.  A series of 16
              state specific    Living         ?       With The Shore    books has been
              produced by the Study of Developed Shorelines at Duke University.  The shore
              series has been mainly funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
              (FEMA).  The new books signal the expansion of the shore series into the realm
              of multihazards.  The multihazard volumes will consist of compilations of
              available knowledge on local geologic hazards plus field observations to
              provide the basis for site specific hazards maps with hazard risk ratings.  The
              elements of mitigation for both property damage and personal risk will also be
              discussed (including considerations of earthquake and high wind construction
              codes).  The goal of the project is to further the dissemination and
              utilization of scientific and engineering knowledge on hazards. The volumes are
              intended for public consumption. This activity is being funded cooperatively by
              NSF and FEMA. ***
