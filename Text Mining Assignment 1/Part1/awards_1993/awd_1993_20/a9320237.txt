Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Marian Dagosto  SBR- 9320237    Similarities in the
              post-cranial skeletons of early fossil primates and extant prosimians have led
              earlier researchers to conclude that the earliest primates moved about in
              similar ways to current prosimians.  However, very few features of the skeleton
              have been reliably correlated with specific positional behaviors in living
              forms, so that the inferred behaviors of extinct early primates remain unclear,
              making it difficult to interpret evolutionary change in primate postcranial
              morphology from a functional perspective.    More than any other element of the
              skeleton, the hand and wrist do reflect clear adapations to different locomotor
              patterns.   Precise biomechanical models incorporating specific variation in
              wrist morphology can be formulated to reconstruct positional/locomotor
              behaviors in fossil primates and to document their phylogenetic patterns of
              change.      This dissertation research, using video, dissection of cadaver
              specimens, and measurement of primate wrists in skeletal collections, will
              reveal historical transitions in primate wrist morphology and positional
              behavior.     ***  P\anthro\jfried\9320237.abs
