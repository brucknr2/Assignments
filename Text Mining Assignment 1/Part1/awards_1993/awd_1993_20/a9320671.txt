Abstract    :
              This proposal, "Mono-Ion Research IV:  Penning Trap Mass  Spectrometer" is for
              the development of the world's most  precise and accurate mass spectrometer. 
              Using only rf  methods for observing the normal mode frequencies of a  single
              isolated ion, bound to a small electromagnetic cage  called a Penning trap, it
              has become possible to measure  masses of low mass-to-charge ions relative to a
              highly-  charged carbon ion with a precision that now exceeds five  parts in
              1010 for a single day's run.  The fundamental goal  of such a high precision
              instrument is to increase the  consistency and accuracy of the fundamental
              constants of  nature.  The immediate objectives will involve: using the 
              accurate mass measurements to "weigh" chemical bonds,  electron ionization
              energies, and nuclear excitation  energies; improve the measurement accuracy of
              the electron's  atomic mass by an order of magnitude; measure light-ion  masses
              to one part in 1010 or higher accuracy and determine  neutron separation
              energies of selected light ions by  measuring consecutive isotopes of the given
              element; and  refine the measurement of the tritium--helium-3 mass  difference
              to an accuracy of 0.3 eV.
