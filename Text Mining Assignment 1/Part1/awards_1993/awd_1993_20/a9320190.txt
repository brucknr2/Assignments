Abstract    :
              9320190  Klemperer  Univ. of Illinois - Urbana  Dr. Walter G. Klemperer,
              Chemistry Department, University of Illinois - Urbana, is supported in the 
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, for studies of
              relatively simple metal oxides and solids that incorporate key features of more
              complex systems of practical importance. The oxidation of olefin-polyoxoanion
              complexes will be investigated with the aim of developing epoxidation
              catalysts. New platinum and palladium polyoxoanion complexes will be prepared
              and their ability to promote olefin polymerization and carbon-hydrogen
              activation will   be probed. Molecular titanates and zirconates will be
              synthesized  and their ability to bind organometallic cations and sulfate will 
               be evaluated. Finally, the solid state reaction chemistry of a series of
              organometallic compounds will be developed.    The significance of the research
              lies in part in developing an understanding about fundamental processes of
              industrial and biological significance. These include the activation of organic
              materials, their reactions with oxygen, and their polymerization.  In addition,
              an emphasis will be placed on discovering entirely new types of materials with
              the hope and expectation that new and useful applications will be developed.
