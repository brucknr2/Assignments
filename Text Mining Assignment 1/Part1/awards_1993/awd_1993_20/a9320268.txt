Abstract    :
              Reifsnyder  9320268  The Department of State will combine funding from the
              National Science Foundation with  funding from other Federal agencies in an
              overall U.S. contribution to the 1993 activities  of the Intergovernmental
              Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  This will support the work  of the IPCC
              Secretariat to produce the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (scheduled for 
              publication in late 1995) and to support the participation of scientists from
              developing  countries in meetings of IPCC Working Groups and Subgroups which
              have been assigned  responsibilities for preparing inputs, especially on
              scientific issues, for the Second Assess-  ment Report.  The Second Assessment
              Report will include three focussed assessments.   The first will address
              science as in the First Assessment.  However, the second will cover  both
              impacts and response options (rather than "strategies") and the third will
              address  "cross-cutting economic and other issues".  The science assessment
              will address: carbon  dioxide and the carbon cycle; other greenhouse gases;
              aerosols; radiative forcing; and  methodologies for developing national
              inventories of net emissions.
