Abstract    :
              9320892  Klein    Technical abstract:  Cuprate superconductors evolve from a 
              strongly-correlated state which has one carrier per active site and  which is
              an antiferromagnetic insulator.  When carriers are added  via doping,
              correlation effects are believed to cause high  temperature superconductivity. 
              Photons can excite carrier pairs -  one doubly-occupied copper site plus one
              empty site - or a carrier  from a copper orbital to another orbital on the same
              site.  These  excitations are produced by photon absorption, Raman scattering,
              or  as the intermediate state of a spin-exchange Raman process.  To  better
              understand their behavior the excitations are probed as  functions of
              temperature, doping and magnetic field.    Non-technical abstract:  High
              temperature superconductors owe their  properties to strong repulsive
              interactions among the carriers of  electric current.  They move among copper
              atoms, and when each  copper atom has precisely one carrier, repulsion causes
              the  carriers to become localized on the copper sites.  Electrical  conduction
              then ceases; the material is an insulator.  In order to  move the carriers a
              finite "quantum" of energy has to be supplied.   This is done via adsorption of
              light or by means of scattered  light.  The properties of the excited carriers
              is studied as  functions of temperature, doping and magnetic field.  The goal
              is  to understand the insulating phase in detail and thereby better  understand
              the superconducting state that results from it.  ***
