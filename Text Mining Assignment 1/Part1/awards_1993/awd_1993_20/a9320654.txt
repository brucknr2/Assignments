Abstract    :
              9320654  Wolfe       This grant will support a workshop concerned with 
              environmental issues of major concern to manufacturing. The  workshop is
              intended to bring together institutions of higher  education, business, and
              industry throughout Arizona and the  surrounding region.  The intent of the
              workshop will be to promote  awareness and understanding and to discuss
              planning and practical  courses of action for companies in relation to
              environmental  issues, laws and regulations which affect the manufacturing
              world.        This workshop will be organized around three tracks:   Waste 
              management issues; air pollution and the impact of the Clean Air  Act
              Amendments on business and industry; and issues of water  pollution and the
              impact of the Safe Drinking Water Act on business  and industry.  Given the
              concern for environment and the impact of  the design, production, use and
              recycle lifecycle on the  environment, this workshop will address important and
              relevant  topics for industry and the university.
