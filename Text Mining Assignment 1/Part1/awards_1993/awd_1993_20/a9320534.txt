Abstract    :
              9320534  Lewis    Under the direction of Dr. R. Barry Lewis, Ms. Sibel Barut
              will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will study 
              archaeological materials from the site of Lukenya Hill, Kenya and  also conduct
              limited excavation at the locality. Lukenya Hill is  extremely important for
              Africanist prehistorians because the area  contains a number of individual
              sites which span the period from  recent times to over 50,000 years ago.
              Excavations have yielded  not only abundant lithic materials but also large
              series of  faunal remains. Ms. Barut will focus on the lithics and study the 
              processes employed to convert raw materials into finished tools.  In
              collaboration with other scientists, neutron activation  analyses will be
              conducted to determine the sources for the  stone. Obsidian hydration dating
              will allow age assessments of  the different sites and levels. On this basis it
              will be possible  to gain insight into changing land use and mobility
              strategies  over time.    Within the last 100,000 years major changes in social
              and  technological organization occurred in Africa and the result was  people
              with essentially modern cultural capacities. Information  to date indicates
              that this transformation occurred first in sub  Saharan Africa and therefore
              considerable archaeological  attention has been focussed on this region and
              time period.  Unfortunately, the number of sites which span this transition are
               very few. Lukenya Hill is one of them and because of this MS.  Barut's study
              is of major significance.    This research is important for several reasons. It
              will shed new  light on the emergence of modern cultural capacities. It will 
              provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the  training of
              a promising young scientist.  ***
