Abstract    :
              9320332  Price    Description:  This project supports travel and  field expenses
              for Dr. Trevor Price of the  University of California, San Diego, to conduct 
              research in India.  His Indian collaborator is  Dr. Priya Davidar of
              Pondicherry University.  A  graduate student from U.C.S.D., Mr. Madhusudan 
              Katti, will assist in the field work.  The  research aim is the study of the
              factors that  limit population sizes of migratory bird  species.  Conditions
              during the breeding season  and during the non-breeding season have been 
              implicated.  The planned field work is to study  the wintering warblers in
              south India, with  special focus on a single group of warblers  (genus
              Phylloscopus), which are abundant and  easy to study in winter, and which form
              a  single tightly knit ecological guild.  The  research will include
              identification of birds  returning, and the territories they return to,  the
              strategies of feeding and the territorial  behavior of both sexes in different 
              psychological conditions including the effect  of the breeding season.  It is
              expected that  this work would help develop a broader picture  of wintering
              populations in Asia, and allow  comparisons with studies on other continents.  
              The study will help fill a gap in what is known  about the morphology-ecology
              associations in  warblers in the non-breeding season.    Scope:  The project
              provides support to do  field research for a U.S. scientist, working  with a
              graduate student, and in collaboration  with an Indian scientist.  India has
              unique  resources and facilities in the project area,  of biodiversity.  The
              project fits well with  INT's objectives.   ***
