Abstract    :
              INT 93-20084  Lyons    This dissertation enhancement grant supports a Kenyan
              graduate student enrolled in the Hydrogeology program at the University of
              Nevada, Reno, Mr. Bwire E. Ojiambo,  working under the guidance of Dr. W. Berry
              Lyons, to do field research at Lake Naivasha, in Kenya.  The project will study
              groundwater-surface water interaction and characterize the subsurface outflow
              from Lake Naivasha towards the Olkaria geothermal field.  Such information is
              critical for the future development of water and energy resources in Kenya,
              since Lake Naivasha is the country's main source of fresh water for all sectors
              -- public water supply, agriculture, electric power, wildlife and ecology.. 
              The project will use seepage meter and piezometric data to evaluate seepage
              from the lake.  Using several different chemical tracers, including strontium
              and helium isotopes, simultaneously, to evaluate seepage and mixing will 
              provide some independent corroboration of the hydraulic data interpretation. 
              The study will demonstrate how chemical data combined with a suite of isotope
              analyses can be used to investigate surface water-groundwater interactions. 
              The field data collection work will be done with the assistance of a team of
              scientists employed by the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, Ltd., which
              manages the geothermal project at Olkaria.  Thus, besides the degree training
              for the student, the research effort will transfer technology to a number of
              Kenyan geothermal scientists working at Olkaria.  The information collected in
              this project, together with previous information utilized in the current
              project, will be synthesized into a recommendation document that will be
              submitted to parties with interest in the optimum use and management of the
              Lake Naivasha waters.      ***
