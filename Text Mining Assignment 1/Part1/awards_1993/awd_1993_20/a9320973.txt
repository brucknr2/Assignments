Abstract    :
              9320973  Jaffe  Knowledge spillovers are key to understanding the process of 
              technological progress, how it contributes to economic growth,  and how policy
              levers can be used effectively to foster growth  through innovation.  Knowledge
              spillovers are created when  universities and government labs produce the basic
              research  results that provide the foundation for applied research in the 
              private sector; they are also created in the private sector, when  researchers
              take advantage of knowledge produced by other private  agents.  Yet, despite
              this importance and a decade of research,  crucial questions remain unanswered.
               For example, we do not know  the relative importance of different
              institutions, different  industries and different geographic regions in
              generating  spillovers; the extent to which spillovers are contained within 
              local or national boundaries; whether and how firms vary in their  ability to
              use spillovers from others; and how the public  knowledge flows that spillovers
              represent have varied over time.   The contribution of this project comes from
              assembling a  comprehensive database on patents, validating the use of patent 
              citations as evidence of knowledge flows through the detailed  examination of
              other evidence, and using the datasets to address  these unanswered questions. 
                More specifically, the project constructs a comprehensive  database on all
              patents granted between 1975 and 1993 and all  citations made by those patents,
              including references to earlier  patents going back to 1871.  The citations
              database is used to  map the flows of knowledge across time and among sectors, 
              geographic regions, and different institutions such as firms,  universities and
              government labs, and to measure the "basicness"  and appropriability of
              particular inventions or the portfolio of  inventions held by particular firms,
              sectors or regions.  The  database will be merged with the NBER R&D Panel
              dataset, which  contains annual financial and market value information on over 
              2000 firms.   It will also be merged with the Census LRD data on  production by
              establishment, and the Census-NSF industrial R&D  survey data.  These datasets
              will be used to explore a number of  important questions at the heart of the
              economics of  technological change and crucial to technology policy.
