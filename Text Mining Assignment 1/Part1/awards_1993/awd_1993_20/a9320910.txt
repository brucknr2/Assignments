Abstract    :
              9320910  Franck    Technical abstract:  The equilibrium and dynamic properties
              of  liquid mixtures, especially near boundaries will be investigated  using
              ellipsometric techniques.  A key feature of the experiments  is the achievemenr
              of a very high temperature stability and very  low thermal gradients.  Studies
              include the following:  uncovering  new surface critical phenomena through
              chemical tuning, determining  the effect of weak thermal convection on the
              delicate liquid  structure necessary to achieve gravity thinned wetting in 
              equilibrium, investigate potential of non equilibrium methods to  when limited
              by long equilibration times in polymer solution  studies, and search for
              correlated motion statistically in the  dynamics of colloidal particles subject
              to intense thermal noise  and slight long range intermolecular forces.   
              Non-technical abstract:  We have recently discovered details about  how
              fluctuations in a thermal system behave near a boundary.  Up to  now the effect
              of the boundary has always been so great in  microscopic observations that
              increasing its influence would not  lead to any new information.  The situation
              is like listening to a  radio that is so loud that one can make out the rhythm
              of a song  but not the words.  A potential solution is to reduce the strength 
              of the boundary through chemical means.  Reflected light is used to  detect
              changes at the surface.  With accurate temperature control  the sensitivity of
              amplifying the effect of thermal fluctuations is  equal to the experimental
              precision of a few parts in a million.  ***
