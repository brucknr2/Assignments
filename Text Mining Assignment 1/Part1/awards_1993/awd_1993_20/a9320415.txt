Abstract    :
              9320415  Tamargo  This proposal is for the growth and characterization of novel 
              ternary and quaternary II-VI compound semiconductors and  heterostructures that
              will provide a range of unique properties  needed for the design of practical
              visible light emitters.  At  present, rudimentary blue-green lasers based on
              ZnCdSe/ZnSe  heterostructures have been demonstrated.  The ternary is the 
              small bandgap material or well.  However, non-ideal band offsets  between those
              two materials and defects due to lattice mismatch  within the II-VI structure
              and with the substrate limit the  performance of the device. As in III-V
              technology, it is possible  to combine binary II-VI compounds to form ternary
              and quaternary  alloys and thus adjust the band structure ad lattice constant
              of  the materials to those desired.  Very few of these II-VI mixed  alloys have
              been grown and investigated.  It will be enhanced through several
              collaborations for additional  materials characterization.  Simple devices
              using those  heterostructures which posses more promising properties, will 
              also be investigated.  ***
