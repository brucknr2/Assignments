Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research project is to apply feedback  control
              systems analysis methods to address the process of  technology innovations in
              organizations.  Specifically, the initial  focus of the project is to use a
              feedback model of costs and  benefits to quantify factors influencing the
              success of information  technology implementation efforts.  Information
              technology in  general and computer mediated communication systems in
              particular  have been the subject of a large research literature base in the 
              social and behavioral sciences, as well as human factors and  computer
              sciences.  One of the consistent findings from this  diverse body of research
              is that new information technologies  (IT's) often fail to meet the
              organizational, work group, and  individual expectations of increased
              productivity and communication  efficiency.    The proposed research utilizes a
              methodology which, although new in  terms of social science research, has a
              long tradition in systems  engineering.  This methodology combines the concepts
              of systems  dynamics and economic cost and benefit analysis within the 
              theoretical framework of both Living Systems and Sociotechnical  Systems
              theories.  By identifying situational, organizational,  cultural, and other
              factors which affect successful IT  implementation, a cost and benefits model
              can be derived which will  apply to the diffusions of IT's and other
              communications or  technology innovations across organizations.
