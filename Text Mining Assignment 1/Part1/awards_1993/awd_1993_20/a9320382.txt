Abstract    :
              9320382  Ku    This is a joint "TIE" project on the topic of "Video-Rate A/D 
              Conversion using Parallel Delta-Sigma Modulators", to be conducted  by the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Design  of Analog-Digital
              Integrated Circuits at Washington State  University, the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for  High-Speed Image/Signal Processing at the
              University of California-  Irvine, and the Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for  Ultra-High Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems at the
              University  of California-San Diego.    The proposed research will evaluate the
              practical viability and  limitations of a very fast medium-accuracy analog to
              digital  converter using a novel oversampled configuration.  The practical 
              limitations and tradeoffs of this architecture will be addressed.  This project
              is being cost shared with all the Industry/University  Cooperative Research
              Centers involved.    The Program Manager recommends the University of
              California, San  Diego be awarded $25,000 for the first year of a two-year 
              continuing award to conduct a "TIE" project with the University of 
              California-Irvine, and Washington State University.
