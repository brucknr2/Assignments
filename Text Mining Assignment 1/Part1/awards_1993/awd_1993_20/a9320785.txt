Abstract    :
              9320785  Slocum  A novel polarizing thin film material was designed for use as a
              high performance polarizer in Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (AMLCD. The
              metal film polarizer (MFP) material consists of evaporatively deposited Ag
              metal spheroid layers laminated with transparent dielectric layers.  The MFP
              material replaces the plastic polarizers which are currently attached to the
              outer surfaces of a LCD cell.  The MFP material is a non-organic sheet
              polarizer which is formed by a proprietary process developed by Polatomic, Inc.
               for use in a NASA solar observatory.  In Phase I we established optical
              specifications for LCD polarizers and designed by means of computer simulation
              a MFP material suitable for AMLCD use.  Experiments were performed to produce
              monolayer spheroid films with contrast of 30 at the desired peak wavelength of
              525nm.  Computer design of a MFP material with 90% transmission and contrast
              greater the 35 in the band from 450 nm to 625 nm along with design of narrow
              band polarizers with contrast greater than 10,000 at 530 nm established the
              feasibility of fabricating a high-efficiency MFP material in Phase II.  A
              Process Development Plan was prepared describing the research and development
              road map for developing the fabrication process in Phase II.  ***
