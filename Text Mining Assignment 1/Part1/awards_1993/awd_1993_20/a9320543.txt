Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to guide the building of appropriate  technology to
              support the work of small groups.  The strategy is to  interleave empirical
              work with theory building, and field work with  lab work.  The field of
              research provides baseline data about how  small groups work on specific tasks.
               Further, the field data helps  suggest the kind of groupware that might assist
              that kind of work.   Tasks that mimic the key aspects of behavior in the field
              have been  developed for use in the lab.  These are used to explore the value 
              of various forms of groupware support for both face-to-face and  distributed
              work.  Different forms of audio and video support are  also investigated for
              distributed work.  The empirical work is used  to evolve a conceptual framework
              in which characteristics of the  group, the task, and the technology are
              related.
