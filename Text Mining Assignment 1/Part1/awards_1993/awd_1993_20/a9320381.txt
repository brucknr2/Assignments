Abstract    :
              9320381 Galton  This is a joint "TIE" project on the topic of "Video-Rate A/D
              Conversion using Parallel Delta-Sigma Modulators", to be conducted by the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Design of Analog-Digital
              Integrated Circuits at Washington State University, the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for High-Speed Image/Signal Processing at the
              University of California- Irvine, and the Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Ultra-High Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems at the
              University of California-San Diego.  The proposed research will evaluate the
              practical viability and limitations of a very fast medium-accuracy analog to
              digital converter using a novel oversampled configuration.  The practical
              limitations and tradeoffs of this architecture will be addressed. This project
              is being cost shared with all the Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Centers involved.  The Program Manager recommends the University of California,
              Irvine be awarded $25,000 for the first year of a two-year continuing award to
              conduct a "TIE" project with Washington State University, and the University of
              California-San Diego.
