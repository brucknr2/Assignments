Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. Marjatta Lyyra of Temple University will investigate the   long range
              interactions, at separations in excess of 10 Angstroms,    between pairs of
              alkali atoms in order to map out the potential surface   near the dissociation
              limit of  alkali diatomic molecules.  The sodium   molecule is the principal
              species to be investigated.  The molecules are   prepared in their long range
              states by multiple laser excitation.   A new   multiple resonance technique,
              stimulated radiative dissociation, will be   used to study photodissociation
              dynamics state selectively as function of   molecular rotation and and energy
              in order to achieve full understanding   of long range nonadiabatic mixing of
              states.  The correlation of the   initial internuclear distance prepared as
              dissociation begins with the   strengths of the nonadiabatic couplings will
              also be studied.  As part of   this work new methods will be developed to
              enhance the detection of   continuous wave multiple resonance signals.    This
              research contributes to the understanding of behavior of atoms at   large
              internuclear separations  at the onset of chemical reactions.  At   large
              internuclear separations many electronic energy states are often   closely
              spaced, making for couplings betwen them which affect the   bond-breaking
              photodissociation, and bond-forming associative ionization   processes.  The
              information gathered in this work will be of assistance   in understanding the
              results of contemporary research on atomic   collisions at ultra low
              temperatures.
