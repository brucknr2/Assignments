Abstract    :
              9320648  Marks    NSF support is provided from funds allocated by Federal agency
               members of the interagency CEES Sub-Committee on Global Change  Research, for
              shared international funding of the centralized costs  of planning for the
              International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme  (IGBP).  Planning and development
              of a series of core research  projects of the IGBP will be undertaken.  The
              IGBP and these core  projects will support development of a global observing
              system;  will contribute to international assessments of global change sci- 
              ence, in particular to those of the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change
              (IPCC); will improve and facilitate the flow of data  and information in
              support of IGBP research; and will assist  scientists and scientific
              institutions in developing countries to  participate more fully in and support
              such research.  Results of  the IGBP will provide input to the analysis,
              modelling, and  interpretation of global change.  To achieve these objectives, 
              meetings of international scientific committees and scientific  steeering
              groups for the core projects will be convened.   Scientific and technological
              reports which result from IGBP  activities will be prepared and distributed. 
              The IGBP Secretariat  will support these activities.
