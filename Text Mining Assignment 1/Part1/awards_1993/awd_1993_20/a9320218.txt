Abstract    :
                        9320218  Evert  The proposed research involves studies on the
              development and  structure of the leaves of maize and barley, utilizing bright-
               field, transmission electron, epifluorescence, and confocal laser  scanning
              microscopy.  The developmental and structural studies will  be complemented by
              experimental studies aimed at determining: 1)  the pathways followed by
              photoassimilates in source and sink  leaves; 2) the sites and mechanisms of
              phloem loading and unloading  in source and sink leaves, respectively; 3) the
              structural  modifications associated with the sink-to-source conversion; and 4)
               the pathways followed by water, which enters the leaf in the  transpiration
              stream, to intermediate, small, and transverse veins  at various levels of
              leaves undergoing sink-to-source conversion.    Maize and barley, as other
              grass leaves, provide an excellent  system for following a sequence of cellular
              and subcellular events  precisely because polarized cell division at the base
              of the leaf  results in an unmixed gradient of cell development.  This same 
              system should be ideal for determining the underlying mechanisms of  the
              sink-to-source transition.  The leaves of maize and barley  differ in many
              details both structurally and developmentally.   Parallel studies on the leaves
              of both of these economically  important grasses will provide a more balanced
              picture of  structure-function relations in grass leaves than would an 
              investigation of only one of them.  The results of these studies  will have
              long-term practical importance in relation to crop  productivity and will be of
              value to investigators interested in  relations of viruses, insects,
              mycoplasmas, and other parasites to  their hosts and in the movement of
              insecticides and growth  regulating substances in cultivated plants.  ***
