Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT    9320466  Garden, Rognvald    This project
              will build mid-infrared (828um)imaging Fabry-  Perot interferometer use with a
              variety of infrared  telescopes, including the ITRF, UKIRT, and the new Keck I
              &  II telescopes. The instrument will facilitate diffraction-  limited (<0.5
              arcsec/pixel) imaging at high spectral  resolution (103 /105) in a variety of
              important ionic and  molecular spectral lines.  The design is suited for
              studying  the dynamics of extended, optically obscured regions of  ionic or
              warm molecular gas.  Such regions include, but are  not restricted to,(1) HII
              regions associated with young OB  star clusters, (2) molecular cloud shocks
              associated with  young stellar outflows, (3) photodissociation regions, (4) 
              the Galactic Center, and (5) galactic nuclei and  extragalactic HII regions.   
              The major components of the interferometer consist of a pair  of carefully
              matched cryogenic Fabry-Perot interferometers  and a large 128 128 mid-infrared
              detector array.  The  limiting noise-equivalent-line flux at the highest
              spectral  resolution will be comparable to that of similar  instrumentation
              planned for SIRTF.    Furthermore, the instrument will be built in two phases. 
              In  the first phase, the design will be optimized for operation  in the 813um
              window.  The second phase will involve the  design and construction of
              additional hardware to extend the  operation into the relatively unexplored
              1624um window.  ***
