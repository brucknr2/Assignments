Abstract    :
              9320537  White    This project builds on recent research that demonstrated that
              the nebulosity  surrounding the familiar Pleiades star cluster results from an
              accidental  encounter between the cluster and an interstellar cloud.  The
              interaction  creates a unique laboratory for the study of astrophysical
              processes in the  interstellar medium.  Dr. White will observe narrow
              absorption lines produced  by the interstellar gas in the spectra of stars in
              and near the cluster to probe  and analyze the cloud-cluster interaction.  This
              award falls within the  Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program at
              NSF.
