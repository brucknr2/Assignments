Abstract    :
              9320250  Mouschovias    The main objective of Dr. Mouschovias theoretical
              research project is a  detailed, quantitative study of the role of ambipolar
              diffusion in the formation  and contraction of protostellar cores in massive
              molecular clouds.  The effect  of interstellar dust particles in coupling the
              magnetic field to the dominant  neutral species, and thereby affecting the
              contraction time and possibly the  masses and sizes of protostellar cores, will
              be at the heart of the project.   The goals of the project will be achieved
              through a systematic formulation  and solution of a series of increasingly more
              complicated physical problems,  beginning with simulations for which no changes
              in the numerical codes are  needed and ending with simulations requiring
              substantial modification of the  axisymmetric code to include a self-consistent
              calculation of the ionization  equilibrium, including grain effects, at each
              time step of the evolution.
