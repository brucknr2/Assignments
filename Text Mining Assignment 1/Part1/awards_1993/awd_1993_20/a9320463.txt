Abstract    :
              9320463  Langton       This award will provide support for a workshop on
              artificial  life and evolutionary biology, to be held at the Santa Fe 
              Institute, Santa Fe, NM, on February 18-20, 1994.   The workshop  will explore
              how artificial life techniques (i.e. computational  techniques) can most
              effectively be used to address problems in  evolutionary and population
              biology.  The results of the workshop  will be published in technical reports
              and in articles to  journals.  ***
