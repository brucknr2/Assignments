Abstract    :
              9320926  Pint  This research proposes to estimate water demand and price 
              elasticities using residential billing data from Alameda  County Water District
              in California over the period 1982 to  1992. The empirical part of the research
              will use data for  599 single-family households, as well as information on 
              house size, lot size, household income, weather variables,  and other
              socioeconomic variables from the 1980 and 1990  censuses. The demand equation
              also controls for variables  that capture drought management policies used by
              the water  agencies, such as publicity, distribution of water-saving  devices,
              and use restrictions.  Data on household water rate  schedules, water use and
              other price measures are obtained  from California water agencies that used
              price increases as  a drought management policy.  The project is important
              because it promises to produce  reliable estimates of price elasticities of
              water demand  that would assist water agency managers in all parts of the 
              United states in assessing the effectiveness of price as a  conservation
              device, the effects of relatively large price  increases on household water use
              and water agency revenues,  and the potential consumer surplus losses due to
              droughts.  Moreover, the findings from this study would become  increasingly
              valuable if global climate change caused larger  or more frequent water
              shortages to occur in the United  States.  ***
