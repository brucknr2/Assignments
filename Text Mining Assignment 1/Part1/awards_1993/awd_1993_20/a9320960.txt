Abstract    :
              9320960  CUTLER  Public trust in the process of trial by jury rests on peoples' 
              perceptions of the fairness of trial procedures and the accuracy  of trial
              outcomes.  Behavioral science methodology can be used to  assess the fairness
              and accuracy of trial procedures, to make  recommendations for improving those
              procedures, and ultimately to  enhance peoples' faith in the justice system. 
              This research  focuses on one of the most common elements of criminal and civil
               trials: eyewitness testimony.  By bringing behavioral science  data to bear on
              the effectiveness of traditional legal safeguards  designed to ensure the
              accuracy of eyewitness testimony, this  research will make concrete and
              practical recommendations  concerning trial procedure.      In this series of
              experiments the PIs systematically examine  attorney, judge and jury
              sensitivity to the factors that  influence the quality of identifications tests
              and their  abilities to use this information to properly evaluate the  utility
              of eyewitness testimony.  The methodology involves  exposing practicing
              attorneys to simulated line-up identification  tests, judges to simulated
              motions to suppress identification  testimony, and experienced jurors to
              simulated trials, and  recording their reactions to and evaluations of the
              fairness of  the procedures and the likely accuracy of the eyewitness 
              testimony.  ***
