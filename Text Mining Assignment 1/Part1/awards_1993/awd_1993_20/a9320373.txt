Abstract    :
              9320373  MADDIESON     Arrernte, an Australian language, is unusual among the
              world's languages in containing several subtly but meaningfully different
              consonants produced by contact between the tip and/or blade of the tongue and
              the roof of the mouth.  Their acoustic characteristics, and how the
              distinctions are made and perceived, are not well understood.  Studies
              including a sufficient population to account for inter-speaker variation are
              also lacking.  the planned research will seek to link articulatory gestures
              involved in producing these consonants with salient acoustic characteristics,
              and to determine the roles of active articulator shape, area of passive
              contact, and other variations in oral cavity configuration.   Acoustic and
              palatographic records for twelve speakers will be obtained and submitted to
              preliminary analysis during an extended fieldwork trip to Australia.  Various
              potential perceptual cues will be tested to evaluate which are most effective
              in predicting recognition of these consonants.  Final analysis of field data
              will be completed at UCLA.   This study will constitute the first
              comprehensive, instrumentally-backed, multi-speaker characterization of
              production, acoustics and perception for a language of this type.  It will
              contribute to descriptive phonetics, the understanding of perceptual cues,
              knowledge about uniformity of articulations within a language, and will help
              shape hypotheses about linguistic universals.    ***
