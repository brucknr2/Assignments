Abstract    :
              9320695  Levine    At times powerful governments seem to be seized by economic 
              forces beyond their ability to control:  during a twenty-four  hour period, for
              example, the British government raised interest  rates to astronomical levels,
              swearing under no circumstances to  devalue the pound, only to do exactly that.
               At other times,  seemingly minor tinkering with policy can unleash profound
              and  unplanned change: the enormous changes in the former Soviet  Union, for
              example, seem to have been triggered by relatively  mild political reforms
              introduced by Gorbachev in the mid-  eighties.  This project develops and
              experimentally tests a  rigorous theory that makes quantitative predictions
              about the  strength of economic forces.  To the extent that such predictions 
              are correct, they are of great value, directing attention to  those types of
              problems and situations where policy can make a  real difference.  This project
              uses data from experimental  economics to validate the theory and improves the
              predictive  power of the theory in assessing situations where economic forces 
              are extremely weak, such as the case with the changes unfolding  in the former
              Soviet Union.
