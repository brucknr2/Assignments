Abstract    :
                  9320026  Knobler    This award will support the participation of nine U.S.
              scientists  to take part in a workshop on the structure of monolayers at the 
              air/water interface to be held at Heron Island, Queensland,  Australia in
              February 1994.  The American coordinator is  Prof. Charles M. Knobler from the
              Department of Chemistry,  University of California, Los Angeles.  The
              Australian  organizer is Dr. G. T. Barnes, Department of Chemistry at the 
              University of Queensland. This project is being conducted under  the
              U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program and support in  Australia is
              provided through the Department of Industry,  Technology and Regional
              Development. (DITARD).    The workshop will focus on the application of optical
              techniques  to the determination of the structures of insoluble monolayers  at
              the air/water interface. The availability of bright  synchrotron x-ray sources
              and pulsed neutron sources has made it  possible to carry out diffraction and
              reflection measurements on  interfacial layers. American investigators have
              been involved in  much recent work on the structures of monolayers; Australian 
              scientists have done notable work on monolayers, largely  classical due to the
              lack of easy access to synchrotron and  neutron sources. This situation has now
              changed with the purchase  by the Australian Government of a beam line in
              Japan. The  workshop will be conducted in a Gordon Research Conference style. 
              In addition to the Australian and American participants, two   scientists each
              from France, Germany and Great Britain will  also be taking an active role in
              this workshop.
