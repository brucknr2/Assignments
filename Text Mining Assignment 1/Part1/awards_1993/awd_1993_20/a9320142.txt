Abstract    :
              This proposal is for "Studies in Spectroscopy and Quantum  Electronics" and
              continues a productive and exciting program  in laser cooling and trapping. 
              The studies of the cooling  and trapping process are aimed at extending the
              technique of  Raman cooling combined with dipole trapping to reach sub- 
              microkelvin temperatures at high densities.  The trapped  atoms will be use to
              study atom/atom collisions in the sub  micro-Kelvin temperature range and
              atom/surface collisions  with atoms in the sub nano-kelvin temperature range. 
              The  cooled and trapped atoms are also being used to study atom  interferometry
              for precision time measurements and for the  construction of an atom
              interferometer for an ultra-  sensitive gravimeter.  Finally, the techniques
              for  manipulating atoms are being extended to the manipulation of  biological
              molecules to study the motion of enzymes and to  measure forces on biological
              molecules.
