Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona in the
              purchase of a cluster of  IBM  workstations.  This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including  the  following:  theoretical
              chemistry, NMR, crystallography and molecular modeling.    %%%  A workstation
              network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the  
              computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a "computer network" also
              serves as a   development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms,
              provides state-of-the-art  graphics and visualization facilities and supports
              research in state-or-the-art applications  of  parallel processing.
