Abstract    :
              9320310  Kingsland  Charles Darwin offered his theory of evolution based on
              natural  selection in 1859.  Yet it was not widely accepted in the United 
              States until the 1930's and 40's until the "evolutionary biology  synthesis"
              when Darwinian natural selection was shown to be  compatible with population
              genetics (which had replaced Mendelian  genetics).  Dr. Kingsland is
              investigating the rise of experimental  biology in the United States.  It was
              this experimental biology  that set the framework for the reconciliation of
              Darwinian theory  with genetics.    Dr, Kingsland is combining a history of
              scientific ideas and  practice with a study of the institutional, social, and
              cultural  context of science.  She is using this study of experimental 
              evolution to address larger themes about the character of American  science in
              the formative years of the 20th century.  Specifically,  she is addressing:  1.
               The American response to German work in  evolutionary biology, especially the
              response to August Weismann;   2. The American response to mutation theory: a
              case study used to  examine the economic, cultural, and institutional factors
              that  encouraged an experimental approach to evolution;  3. The rise and  fall
              of Lamarckian theories of evolution in the American context;   and 4. The
              problem of sex determination as a case study of the role  of gender in the
              American context.  She is also examining the  social processes of cooperation
              and competition that influence the  growth of scientific knowledge.  ***
