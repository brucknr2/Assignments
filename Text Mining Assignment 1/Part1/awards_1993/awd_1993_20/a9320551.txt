Abstract    :
              9320551  Trippe       The Berkeley Particle Data Center is the headquarters of
              the  International Particle Data Group, whose primary task is to  provide high
              energy physics researchers with up-to-date compiled  and evaluated
              particle-properties data and other information they  most frequently need. 
              This information is made available to  about 20,000 researchers, teachers, and
              students through the  biennial publication of the "Review of  Particle
              Properties" and  the "Particle Properties Data Booklet." The Center and its 
              collaborators also produces other compilations of value, "Current  Experiments
              in Elementary Particle Physics," and "Guide to  Experimental Elementary
              Particle Physics Literature." The Center  provides computer network access to
              its databases via the SLAC-  SPIRES system and other more modern public
              interfaces to its  databases.  The Center is also involved in the Contemporary 
              Physics Education Project, which has developed educational  materials such as a
              wall chart, teacher activity packet, and  computer software on "Fundamental
              Particles and Interactions,"  and it has been involved in other activities such
              as the ICFA  Review of Detector Properties and a pilot project, the AIP 
              Physics Data Diskette.  The Center's scientific staff are also  active in
              current theoretical and experimental high energy  physics research and in
              teaching at the University of California  at Berkeley.  ***
