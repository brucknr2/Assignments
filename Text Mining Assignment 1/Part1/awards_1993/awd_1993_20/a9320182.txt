Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will aid in  purchasing a quadrupole mass spectrometer for the Department of
              Chemistry at Western  Kentucky University.  The research studies to be
              performed include the following:  polymer  composite characterization, analysis
               of combustion products from co-firing biomass fuels  with coal and
              quantitative analysis of methane activation.    Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a
              technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain  the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic and
              organometallic molecules.   It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
              tools available for the characterization of  compounds.  This mass spectrometer
              is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many  fields of
              chemistry.
