Abstract    :
                  9320141  Dickinson    Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a growing national
              problem without a good solution.  This project targets MSW as a low
              grade/hazardous fuel and represents a distinct improvement over current
              combustion/incineration methods    By combining a wet RR and Wet Thermal
              Oxidation, EnerTech seeks to commercialize an alternative waste disposal method
              which is less costly, more energy efficient, and has excellent control over
              gaseous and solid emissions.
