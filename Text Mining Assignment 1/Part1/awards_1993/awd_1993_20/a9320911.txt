Abstract    :
              Emerson  9320911    This project will develop a new cleaning technique which
              will  permit 230-Th dating of planktonic foraminifera. If successful, it  would
              extend the range of direct chronology by an order of  magnitude from the
              existing 1 4C-based methods. The problems  heretofore have been the need for
              complete removal of detrital and  adsorbed Th, and the difficulty of making
              precise measurements of  low concentrations. The Pl's plan to address the first
              by using a  series of rinses for reduction of Mn and Fe, followed by chelation 
              to prevent reabsorbed ions. The thermal ionization mass  spectrometer at
              Hanford will be used to achieve precision.
