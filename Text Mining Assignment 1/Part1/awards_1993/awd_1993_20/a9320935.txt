Abstract    :
                    9320935  Shea  This research will investigate the source of comovements 
              across various industries at business cycle frequencies. The  important fact
              about business cycles in the United States is  that different industries tend
              to experience expansions and  contractions at the same time. Most industries do
              well  simultaneously during a boom; conversely, most industries do  poorly
              simultaneously during a recession. There are two  potential explanations for
              such interindustry comovements.  One explanation is that different industries
              tend to  experience similar shocks.The second explanation is the  existence of
              linkages or complementarities connecting  different industries to each other.  
                  This research seeks to determine which types of  complementarity, if any
              have been important sources of  interindustry comovements in the postwar United
              States.The  strategy adopted in the study is to compare the predictions  of
              various linkage models to the actual pattern of  employment and output
              comovement among one hundred and  twenty six US manufacturing industries during
              the postwar  period. The results from this study will help reveal the  channels
              by which shocks are transmitted across sectors of  the economy, and further our
              understanding of the causes of  business cycles.  ***
