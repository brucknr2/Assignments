Abstract    :
              The rates and mechanisms of prototype isomerization and fragmentation  
              reactions of small hydrocarbons will be examined. The molecules selected   for
              study are sufficiently small to allow high-level molecular orbital  
              calculation for comparison to experiment. The studies will include: (1)   the
              rate of cis, trans ethylene-1,2-d2 isomerization, (2) the relative   energy
              barriers for structural vs geometric isomerizations of   cyclopropane-1, 2-d2
              and cyclopropane-1,2,3-d3, (3) energy barriers for   fragmentation of
              cyclobutane-1,3-d2, (4) the stereochemistry of   conversion of bicyclo 1.1.0
              butane-2,2-d2 to butadiene, (5) rate and   mechanism of the 3,4-elimination of
              molecular hydrogen from cyclopentene,   and (6) the stereochemistry of
              reactions of vinylcyclobutane-2,3-d2 to   cyclohexene and to ethylene plus
              butadiene.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
              continuing work   of Professor David K. Lewis at Colgate University. These
              results of this   research will provide fundamental information about processes
              where   carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken and formed. A  
              long-standing question about these processes is whether the bonds are   broken
              in a stepwise manner or in one step. These mechanistic aspects   will be probed
              by the thermal decomposition of deuterium labeled   compounds and compounds
              with unique three-dimensional structure.   Theoretical predictions, based on
              sophisticated calculations, will be   compared to experimental results which
              will be a test of the theory.
