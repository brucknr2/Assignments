Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9320404  Jiang     The proposed research focuses on the
              investigation of natural convection in silicone oils contained in shallow
              rotating cylinders.  To evaluate the phenomena involved, a scaling analysis
              will be performed to study the interaction of buoyancy, centrifugal, Coriolis,
              and viscous forces, in an effort to obtain a transport correlation for the
              range of parameters to be studied.  To evaluate the accuracy of the work, an
              experimental investigation will also be conducted.  The heat transfer rate and
              temperature distributions will be measured to determine the thermal boundary
              layers and transport correlation.  Visualization of the flow field will be
              achieved by using a photochromic technique associated with ultraviolet optical
              fiber probes to reveal the nature of the convective flow.  Based upon the
              combined experimental and scaling results, a heat transport correlation will be
              developed for use in applications involving rotating Ni-Zn batteries.
