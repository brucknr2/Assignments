Abstract    :
              This research is on developing circuit design and test algorithms  that run on
              parallel computers.  These include efficient,  asynchronous, portable parallel
              algorithms for: (A) synthesis of  combinational circuits; and (B) for test
              generation and fault  simulation of combinational and sequential circuits. 
              Algorithms  are being written using an environment that makes it possible to 
              port CAD applications across a wide range of MIMD machines.  In  addition they
              are designed to allow a maximum overlap of  computation and communication.  The
              algorithms are being tested on  numerous parallel platforms.
