Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9320739  Chen, J. C.     The research proposal requests funds
              for registration and partial travel support for participants of the Engineering
              Foundation's International Workshop on Convective Flow Boiling. The scope of
              the conference will be limited to boiling systems which are affected by
              convective flow, the type most often encountered in applications.  The
              phenomena of bubble nucleation, bubble dynamics, vapor blanketing, rewetting of
              superheated surfaces, mass diffusion, etc. and how these phenomena interact
              with bulk flow will be discussed.  It is expected that this conference, which
              will be held in a workshop format, will lead to a better understanding of the
              issues and problems related to this field.
