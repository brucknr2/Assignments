Abstract    :
              9320478  Miller  This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing 
              Program in the support of the research of Professor Joel  Miller. Support is
              provided by the Divisions of Chemistry and  Materials Research. The focus of
              the research is the  development of structure-property relationships for a
              family of  magnetic polymeric manganese porphyrin/tetracyanoethylene 
              complexes. Emphasis will be on porphyrin ligand substitution  including the
              design and synthesis of macrocyclic ligands with  unpaired spins on their
              periphiry. Magnetic materials with  other macrocyclic ligands such as
              phthalocyanines,  tetraazaporphyrins and dibenzotetraaza- 14 annulenes will
              also  be prepared. In concert with new ligands, complexes with other  metals
              having unpaired spins such as vanadium(III),  chromium(III) and iron(III) will
              also be prepared and  characterized for their magnetic properties. Professor
              Miller  will complement his synthetic studies with computational  studies and
              advanced characterization techniques.    Magnets are ubiquitous in technology.
              This research program  will offer the possibility of engineering desired
              properties  such as processibility, transparency, compatibility with other 
              polymers, solubility and control of magnetic properties into  polymeric
              molecular magnets.
