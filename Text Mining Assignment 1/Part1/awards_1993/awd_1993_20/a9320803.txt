Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the  
              Chemistry Division, McHale will use resonance Raman (RR) techniques to   study
              intermolecular interactions in the condensed phase, particularly   the effects
              of solvent dynamics on charge transfer processes.  Raman   excitation profiles
              will be time-analyzed in systems such as betaine and   triphenylmethane dyes,
              as well as in two-chromophore systems.  Results   will be compared with those
              from ultrafast spectroscopy experiments.  To   isolate solvent dynamics from
              energetics, isotopic substitution of the   solvent will be employed, and other
              parameters such as polarity,   viscosity, and polarizability will be
              investigated.  %%%  The results of this research will lead to a better
              understanding of the   influence of a solvent on chemical reactions which are
              occurring in it.    This work will also contribute to understanding how to
              control chemical   reactions in solid or liquid phases by using different
              solvents or using   lasers to initiate or enhance the reaction.
