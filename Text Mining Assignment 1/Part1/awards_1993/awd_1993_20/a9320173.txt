Abstract    :
              9320173  Clarke  Ms. Monica Casper, under the direction of Dr. Adele Clarke, is 
              investigating the historical emergence of experimental fetal  surgery.  Fetal
              surgery was considered as early as 1960 following  several successful
              non-surgical fetal treatments.  Research in the  1960's in New Zealand and
              Puerto Rico, in which surgical procedures  were used to treat fetuses for Rh
              incompatibility, paved the way  for subsequent experimental and clinical
              practices.  Fetal surgery  experienced a renaissance in the early 1980's when
              surgeons at the  University of California, San Francisco, began surgically
              operating  on fetuses in utero.    There has been very little historical or
              social research on  experimental fetal surgery.  Ms. Casper is examining the 
              historical, social and cultural roots of this practice, beginning  with
              biomedical research in the 1960's.  She is addressing three  related sets of
              questions.  First, what relationships have existed  among basic physiological
              research, technological developments, and  the emergence of experimental fetal
              surgery in the clinical domain,  and how have these been shaped historically? 
              Second, how are human  and non-human fetuses conceptualized, used, and treated
              materially  in contemporary scientific and biomedical practices? Third, what 
              are the social, cultural, and institutional dimensions of  contemporary
              experimental fetal surgery practices?  Under this  grant, Ms. Casper is
              undertaking archival research and interviews  in New Zealand and Puerto Rico
              focused on the experimental work of  the 1960's.  ***
