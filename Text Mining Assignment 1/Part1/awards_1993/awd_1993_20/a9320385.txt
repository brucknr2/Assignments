Abstract    :
               The goal of this work is to develop an accurate  numerical method which employs
              symbolic computation for    solving linear and  nonlinear multivariable
              integral and  integro-differential   equations of  mathematical physics.   
              When possible, a posteriori (and a   priori) error  estimates are sought to
              evaluate the effectiveness and    accuracy of  the projection methods used for
              obtaining the  numeric   solution.  Projection  methods such as collocation 
              using different sets of basis   functions on either a  global  or local basis
              are developed to obtain accurate and    results.  Symbolic computation permits
              previously    insurmountable analytic  manipulations to be performed for 
              purposes of (1) developing   expansion based  solution methods,  and (2)
              establishing error estimates and   convergence rates.  The major contribution
              of the investigation are  twofold; (1)  to exploit the development of symbolic 
              manipulation for   augmenting analytic,  numeric, and graphic  computation in
              support of solving and   analyzing nonlinear  integral and integro-differential
              equations of mathematical    physics, and (2)  to investigate, extend, and
              develop the  recent formulation   of Kumar  and Sloan for scientific 
              computation of multivariable   equations.
