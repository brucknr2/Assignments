Abstract    :
                     9320974  Wedel       This project involves a cultural anthropologist from
              George  Washington University in a study of the process of foreign aid in  five
              democratizing countries of Eastern Europe.  The  investigators will study three
              state factories in Poland, Hungary  and the Czech Republic, and two state farms
              in Romania and  Albania as they deal with foreign advisers and aid institutions
               in their effort to get help in privatizing their production.  The 
              anthropologists will focus on the ideology, politics and  bureaucratic
              organization of aid in donor societies as well as  the dynamic relations
              involved as donors and recipients negotiate  their way towards large-scale
              technical assistance. Using  ethnographic techniques of in-depth interviews and
              participant  observation, fieldwork in factories and farms in Eastern Europe 
              will be coupled with interviews and observations at U.S., E.C.,  and joint
              East-West meetings where aid policies are formulated.       This research is
              important because the democratizing process  taking place in the former
              Communist countries of Eastern Europe  is one of the major events of our time,
              and its success is  critically important to world peace and prosperity.  The
              actual  implementation of international aid programs is not a one-way  street
              of expertise flowing out of the First World into the ex-  Second World, but a
              complex process of negotiation.  Increased  understanding of the actual
              behavior involved in foreign aid, and  how different perceptions and
              understandings of each other,  different goals and political agendas, and
              different practices  all influence aid outcomes, will be important in
              structuring  future relations between First and ex-Second Worlds.  ***
