Abstract    :
                               LBP:\A9320285            Lieberman             This project
              involves a cultural anthropology graduate student            from the
              University of Florida, studying the health and medical            practices of
              a small group of South American Indians.  The            student will live with
              the Indians in three hamlets in the            Brazilian Amazon to assess the
              effects of varying contact with            the Brazilian National Indian Agency
              (FUNAI) on their health and            medical practices.  Using techniques of
              compiling personal            medical histories, dietary analysis,
              anthropometry, time            allocation studies and ethnographic interviews, 
              the student will            assess the viability of the traditional belief
              system.             This research is important because it provides information
              about            one of the few remaining communities of foragers in the world,
                         who are changing rapidly.  Aside from the benefits to U.S.          
               science of training a professional anthropologist and providing           
              knowledge about this important area of the world, this sort of            case
              study about medical traditions and practices will provide            valuable
              information which can be used to inform policies of any            state with
              respect to such small, unintegrated groups.  The            research also has
              the potential of discovering valuable            traditional health practices
              which could be beneficial in other            situations.              ***
