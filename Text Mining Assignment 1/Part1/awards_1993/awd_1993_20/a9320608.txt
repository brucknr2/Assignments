              ABSTRACT    The PIs propose to investigate a model of teamwork by using a
              two-stage research program.  In the first stage they will survey 200 members of
              teams in order to determine the construct validity of an existing measure of
              team proceses.  In the second part of the research the PIs will use a path
              analyses to assess the relationships among the various teamwork components. 
              The research is particularly timely and important since teamwork is becoming a
              more prevalent part of the American manufacturing environment.
