Abstract    :
              93200097  Woodward  Dr. Woodward is developing a treatment of explanation and
              causation  with applications in both the natural and social sciences.  A 
              guiding theme of his study is that explanatory information is  information that
              is potentially relevant to controlling or  manipulating nature.  Another
              closely related themes that the sorts  of relationships that can be used to
              provide explanations must  satisfy an invariance requirement--they must be
              relationships that  will remain stable under some class of changes or
              interventions,  for these will be exactly the relationships that will support 
              potential manipulations.  These two themes provide a central part  of what Dr.
              Woodward takes to be the picture of causation and  explanation implicit in the
              contemporary econometrics literature.   In this research, he is extending and
              generalizing this picture to  produce a general theory that will enable us to
              understand and  assess the structure of different forms of explanation in the 
              natural and social sciences and in more common sensical contexts.   The theory
              he is developing will have interesting and somewhat  novel consequences for how
              we should understand laws of nature and  their role in explanation, for the
              role of derivational structure  in explanations, for the possibility of
              explanations that do not  appeal to laws, for the relationships between laws
              and  counterfactuals, for the assessment of probabilistic theories of 
              causation, and for understanding the role of idealization in  scientific
              theorizing.  ***
