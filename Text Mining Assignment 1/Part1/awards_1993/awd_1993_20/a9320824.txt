Abstract    :
              9320824  Bielak  This project investigates the seismic performance of earth and 
              rock-fill dams, focusing on the coupling effects between the dam  and its
              support, as well as on the effects of the spatial  variability of the incoming
              seismic waves.  Current design  methods generally assume a rigid dam
              foundation, whereas  observations of the behavior of earth and rock-fill dams
              during  earthquakes suggest that canyon-dam interaction can significantly 
              influence their seismic response.    The main objective is to elucidate the
              conditions under which dam-  canyon interaction effects are practically
              significant, and to  develop methods that can be used in design and remediation
               practice for calculating these interaction effects.  The projects  involves
              computer simulations with two- and three-dimensional  models which reflect
              realistic conditions.  In as much as the  main focus is on gaining a clear
              understanding of the mechanism  by which the dynamic coupling between the dam
              and the canyon  affects the seismic response of the dam, attention is confined 
              largely to dams constructed of either dry or dense saturated  granular soils
              and cohesive soils that are not susceptible to  liquefaction.  Some
              consideration, however, is given to seismic  liquefaction evaluation for cases
              in which loose saturated sands  and cohesionless silts are present.  ***
