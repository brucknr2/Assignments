Abstract    :
              9320175  Dalgarno  Theoretical procedures will be used to interpret molecular 
              spectroscopic data in terms of a potential matrix which can then  also be
              employed to make reliable predictions of low energy atomic  collision
              processes.  Collisions of oxygen and nitrogen atoms will  be investigated.  The
              role of energetic atoms produced by  dissociative recombination in the
              atmosphere will be explored and  the rate coefficients of reactions involving
              hot atoms will be  studied.  Calculations will be carried out of the quenching
              of  vibrationally excited molecular oxygen.  Calculations will be  carried out
              of the Rayleigh and Raman scattering of molecular  oxygen in the region of the
              discrete Schumann-Runge bands.  ***
