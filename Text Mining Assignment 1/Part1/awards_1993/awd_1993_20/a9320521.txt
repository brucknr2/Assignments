Abstract    :
                          9320521  LANDERS  Many  serious environmental problems are
              transboundary in  nature  and  can  only  be  adequately dealt with  through 
              international  cooperation.  As  has  been noted by both scientists  and 
              policy  makers, this is especially true of the Arctic regions. The  links 
              between airborne contaminants and Arctic flora and fauna have not  been
              adequately studied or understood. In addition to documenting  the  current
              state of knowledge regarding ecological  effects  of  airborne contaminants, an
              international symposium will facilitate  the  planning of further scientific
              investigations and  help  lay  the groundwork for informed environmental
              policies. This proposed  international  symposium  on  the ecological  effects 
              of  arctic  airborne  contaminants will take place in Reykjavik, Iceland,  in 
              October 1993.  ***
