Abstract    :
               This project undertakes the implementation of an  algebraic-geometric toolkit,
              written in C, which can solve   systems of  equations over the  complex
              numbers, and inequalities over the  reals.  There are   many applications  of
              such a toolkit, since  problems from many branches of   science and engineering
               can be  formulated using systems of polynomial equations and    inequalities. 
              By  several well-known theorems, in particular,  Tarski's theorem   for the
              reals, it  is possible to solve such  problems in principle.  But the   worst
              case bounds are  exponential  or doubly-exponential in the number of  
              variables, and no  practical  system has appeared that can deal with more than
              a few    special cases.  On the  other hand, systems of polynomials may  have a
              special   structure, a kind of  sparseness, that implies a  complexity
              (measured by the   algebraic degree) much  lower than the  worst case.  Indeed,
              most of the important   applications are of  this type.  Very recently,
              algorithms have been developed   that  can exploit this  structure.  This
              realization is a strong  motivation for   developing the toolkit  at this time.
               In addition,  there have been improvements in   algorithms for sign 
              determination  and symbolic-numeric computation, and it is   felt that these 
              methods are now advanced enough to warrant implementation.
