Abstract    :
              9320651  Butler       This award funds two Iris Indigo workstations to gather 
              network performance measurements for traffic between the National  Center for
              Supercomputer Applications and the three other  NSF-funded supercomputer
              centers.  The centers have joined together  to form a national Metacenter, to
              be linked by a high-speed network  called the National Computational
              Environment.  The dedicated probe  platform supported by this award provides a
              mechanism for testing,  measuring and improving network performance over the
              existing and  future communication links.  Duration of the award is one year.
