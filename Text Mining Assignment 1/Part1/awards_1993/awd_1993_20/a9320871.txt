Abstract    :
              9320871  Charlson       This research project is developing a methodology for in
              situ  measurements of the climatically important optical concerned with 
              properties which can then be applied to regionally representative  sites in
              order to provide relevant parameters for global climate  models.  Our goals to
              characterize measurement uncertainties and to  study the sources of variation
              in the measured parameters by  intensive, observational campaigns.  Aerosol
              optical properties  will be both measured directly and predicated by Mie theory
              form  measurements of aerosol size distribution and size-resolved  chemistry. 
              Convergence of these two approaches is required to  validate the present
              understanding of aerosol optics and assess the  accuracy of various simplifying
              assumptions required by the Mie  calculation.       Four specific tasks will be
                   to quantify and reduce the  uncertainties that presently exist in the
              climatically important  optical properties of tropospheric aerosols; (1)
              develop a  measurement and data analysis methodology, (2) demonstrate closure 
              of an extended measurement set at a well-characterized, minimally-  polluted
              marine site (Cheeka Peak), (3) demonstrate closure at  different representative
              sites (clean and polluted marine, clean  and polluted continental), and (4)
              deliver aerosol optical  parameters to measurement and modelling communities.
