Abstract    :
              9320807  Williams    With this planning grant from The National Science
              Foundation,  Dr. Sloan Williams will develop models which will allow her to 
              reconstruct forms of prehistoric social organization using DNA  data obtained
              from the analysis of ancient bone. In the course of  archaeological fieldwork
              in southern Peru, Dr. Williams and her  collaborators have excavated a series
              of cemeteries which contain  well preserved human skeletal remains. The graves
              also yielded  numerous burial goods which provide information on the social and
               occupational status of the associated individuals. Using current  biochemical
              techniques it is possible to extract and analyze DNA  from these bones and with
              the data thus collected determine the  degree of relatedness among individuals.
              On this basis it should  be possible to reconstruct biological affinity and
              relate this to  social and occupational organization.    While the
              archaeological significance of this work is clear and  the research is
              technically feasible, Dr. Williams must still  develop analytic techniques
              which bridge the gap between data and  question. This grant will provide her
              the time to accomplish  this. The project is important for three reasons. It
              will help to  develop an analytic technique of potential widespread use. It 
              will pave the way for Dr. Williams to design a large scale  effort. It will
              also facilitate the development of a promising  young scientist.  ***
