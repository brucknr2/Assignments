Abstract    :
              9320339  Al-Sheikhly  This is an award to support research, the objectives of
              which are  to investigate the mechanisms for destruction of potentially  toxic
              and hazardous organic materials in aqueous solution using  ionizing radiation
              produced by short pulses of energized  electrons.  The research includes a
              consideration of using  selected additives for enhancing the effectiveness of
              radiation.  Target organic compounds to be studied include representative 
              halogenated and non-halogenated olefin and aromatic compounds.  Dose rates to
              be studied range from those characteristic of  industrial gamma radiation
              sources to those obtained with  electron accelerators used in industrial
              radiation processing.    Radiation processing of contaminated water, solids and
              slurries  represents a potentially important practical way to address 
              environmental problems associated with the presence of toxic or  hazardous
              substances in water and soil.  Results of this project  are expected to provide
              additional insights into the potential  uses of ionizing radiation for
              remediation of environmental  resources contaminated with hazardous organic
              substances and are  likely to be utilized in the engineering design of
              processes and  systems for remediation of contaminated environmental resources 
              of soil and water resources.
