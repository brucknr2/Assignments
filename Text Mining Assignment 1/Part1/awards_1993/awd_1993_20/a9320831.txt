Abstract    :
              9320831  Shiller  The purpose of this project is to provide better measures of 
              major economic risk factors (components of economic or wealth  fluctuations
              that affect many people) to facilitate the creation  of new insurance and
              hedging markets for these risks.   The  biggest economic risks today are not
              represented in any liquid  financial markets.  There are no market for claims
              on national  incomes or an any other large income aggregates.  There is no 
              large liquid market for real estate.  An important reason why  there are not
              liquid markets for such risks is that there are no  agreed-upon objective
              measures of the shocks that represent such  risks.  This research will focus on
              developing indices of incomes  or rents or prices of claims on them that are
              specifically  designed to be the basis of cash settlement of innovative risk- 
              management contracts, such as futures contracts.  In addition,  data will be
              collected and assembled on the behavioral  foundations of speculative market
              behavior: including continuing  time-series data collection on expectations and
              theories among  U.S. and Japanese stock market participants.  ***
