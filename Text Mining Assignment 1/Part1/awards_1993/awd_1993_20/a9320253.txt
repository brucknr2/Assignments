Abstract    :
              9320253  Chin  This project explores the application of ocean surface  current
              radar (OSCR) systems to the identification of  outfall mixing zones.  A single
              deployment of an OSCR system  is typically equivalent to deploying over 1,000
              current  meters, with spacings between current meters on the order of  a few
              hundred meters.  Clearly, OSCR systems have the  capability to define ambient
              surface currents in far greater  spatial and temporal detail than is currently
              feasible using  any other method of measurement.  This study will  investigate
              whether data derived from short-term OSCR  deployments can be effectively
              incorporated in a (far-field)  mixing model that describes the dispersion of
              contaminants  discharged from sewage outfalls.  This project is composed  of
              three tasks: (1) Verify the stationarity of spatial  current patterns measured
              by short-term (on the order of a  month) OSCR deployments; (2) Develop an
              algorithm to utilize  OSCR measurements to simulate mixing of contaminants 
              discharged from ocean outfalls; and (3) Utilize the  developed algorithm to
              predict dispersion at a site where  OSCR measurements are available, and
              validate the algorithm  by comparing the predicted and measured dilutions.  ***
