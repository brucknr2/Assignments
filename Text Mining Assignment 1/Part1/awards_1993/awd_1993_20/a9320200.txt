Abstract    :
              9320200  Crutchfield       The proposed work is concerned with exploring
              algorithms:   evolving cellular automata (CA) and related systems to perform 
              specified computations.  This project will have three major  contributions: 
              (i) Advances in the study of how to perform  computation with spatially
              extended dynamical systems; (ii)  Advances in the theory and practice of
              genetic algorithms; and  (iii) Applications to parallel computation problems
              such as image  processing, noise reduction, texture detection, and the
              automatic  discovery of coherent structures in spatial pattern time series.  
              This project is highly interdisciplinary in that it will call on  very recent
              results in dynamical systems theory, computation  theory, the statistical
              mechanics of phase transitions, and genetic  algorithms.
