Abstract    :
              The westward propoagation and dispersion of a large hydrothermal  plume that
              resulted from recent hydrothermal vent activity on the  Juan de Fuca Ridge will
              be studied by deploying three isobaric  floats. The floats will be deployed at
              1700 dbars and tracked for  a year.
