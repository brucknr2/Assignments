Abstract    :
                                                        9320723  Rose    This grant will
              provide funds for the study of the influence of  environment on the formation
              and evolution of early-type galaxies.   Recently completed research by the
              Principal Investigator and  collaborators has demonstrated a strong connection
              between the  formation/evolution of galaxies in clusters and the evolutionary 
              state of the clusters themselves (i.e., existence of cluster  substructure and
              distribution of the associated hot intracluster  medium).  It is the goal of
              this research program to better  elucidate the interplay between the process of
              galaxy  formation/evolution and the formation/evolution of clusters of 
              galaxies and their associated substructure and hot ICM.
