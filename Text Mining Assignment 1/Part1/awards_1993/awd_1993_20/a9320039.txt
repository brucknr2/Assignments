Abstract    :
                  The dark pigment, melanin, is thought to provide protection of tissue from
              damage from harmful effects of sunlight exposure.  However, melanin also is
              found in the inner ear, and in the embryonic eye.  In certain genetic strains
              with reduced melanin, called hypopigmented, there are specific defects of
              auditory or visual properties, where the severity seems to correlate with the
              extent of melanin reduction and not with mutations in particular genes.  This
              project uses a multi-disciplinary approach of anatomy, physiology, behavior and
              classical genetics to determine how reduced melanin in the eye is related to
              the elevation of dark-adapted thresholds for vision, and to determine the
              location of the defect within the retina of the eye.  A novel hypothesis will
              be tested, to see whether melanin may be acting as a buffer for calcium around
              the photoreceptor cells.  In addition to the impact on visual neuroscience, the
              results could have impact on our understanding the basic role that this
              ubiquitous pigment has in environmental adaptations in other systems and
              animals.
