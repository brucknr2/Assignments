Abstract    :
              9320052  Krause  The project would support new customized devices and  computer
              software to aid persons with disabilities. The  primary goal of the work is to
              provide a meaningful design  experience for the engineering student that will
              directly  aid a specific disabled individual. Some 20 projects are  envisaged
              each year during a three year award. Typical  projects are in the areas of 
              Wheelchair Trainers for  disabled children, Sonic Cane for the visually
              impaired,  Loudness Level Indicator for the hearing impaired to learn  the
              proper speaking level, Electronic Compass for the  visually impaired, Light
              Activated Toys for children with  limited hand capacities, Cooking Timer for
              the deaf, Rocking  Wheelchair, and a People Presence detector for the deaf. 
              Results of the design projects will be published annually in  the report
              National Science Foundation Engineering Senior  Design Projects to Aid the
              Disabled.  ***
