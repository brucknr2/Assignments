Abstract    :
              9320917  Jones    This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support grant investigates
               how Congressional committees and subcommittees influence the  policy process
              for the issue of health policy from 1945-1992.  By  applying methods and theory
              from the agenda setting literature to  study committee behavior, the research
              develops a new approach to  policy making in Congress.    The research consists
              of two main sections.  First, a theoretical  approach to examine the committee
              system is developed using an  issue agenda driven methodology.  Second, the
              empirical phase of  the project involves the creation of a database that traces
               policy development through three phases:  committee and  subcommittee
              hearings; committee markup meetings; and, final  passage of statutes into law. 
              By matching a new theoretical  perspective with this powerful database, this
              research allows for  the examination of the finer details of committee behavior
              long  ignored and least understood to scholars of Congress.  ***
