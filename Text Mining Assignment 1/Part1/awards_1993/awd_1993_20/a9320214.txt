Abstract    :
              9320214  Allen  Working under the direction of Professor Marc Bekoff of the 
              University of Colorado, Dr. Allen is focusing on the impact of  philosophy of
              mind and cognitive ethology on each other.  Dr. Allen  is a philosopher;
              Professor Bekoff is an ethologist.  Dr. Allen is  studying under Professor
              Bekoff's direction the empirical  techniques appropriate to ethology and the
              explanatory objectives  of ethologists.  Dr. Allen's research objectives are to
              improve our  understanding of the extent to which philosophy of mind can help 
              advance empirical objectives of cognitive ethologists and the  extent to which
              ethological data bear on philosophical theories of  mind.  During the course of
              the year that he is spending working in  Colorado, Dr. Allen is participating
              in Professor Bekoff's study of  antipredator vigilance in birds.  These two
              have already jointly  authored articles on conceptual issues in cognitive
              ethology.  They  are using this experience working together in order to develop
              an  extended treatment of cognitive ethology and its relationship to 
              philosophy of mind.  This study promises to be of significance to  specialists
              in both fields as well as to the wider societal  interest in the nature and
              origins of mentality in humans and other  animals.  ***
