              Abstract   ATM-9320004  Pollack, Henry N.  University of Michigan  Title: Global
              Database of Borehole Temperatures and Climate  Reconstructions    This research
              award addresses the design, assembly, analysis and  interpretation of a global
              data base of geothermal observations on  continents relevant to climate change
              over the past 1000 years.   This time interval spans both the pre-industrial
              and industrial  periods, and is relevant to an assessment of both natural 
              variability and anthropogenic forcing the Earth's surface  temperature at the
              century to millennial time scale.  The database  will comprise (1) basic
              geothermal observations from field surveys,  including borehole temperature vs.
              depth data, thermophysical  properties and site descriptions, (2) a ground
              surface temperature  history derived for each site by a standardized inversion
              procedure  operating on the basic field observations, (3) regionalized 
              composite histories derived by joint inversions and/or weighted  averaging of
              individual sites, and (4) cross references to local  meteorological and other
              nearby proxy data.  The database will  include data from several hundred sites
              distributed over six  continents.
