Abstract    :
              9320003  Dean    This grant will provide support to allow scholars from outside 
              the United States to participate in the 1994 "International  Conference on Tree
              Rings, Environment, and Humanity:  Relationships and Processes." In particular,
              effort will focus on  assisting researchers from the third world and Eastern
              Europe.  Without NSF support, such individuals could not attend.     In
              temperate regions of the world, trees add rings annually and  differences in
              the thickness and chemical composition of the  rings are determined by local
              environmental factors. Resultant  series from mature trees may cover hundreds
              of years and provide  excellent information on environmental change. Tree rings
              also  serve a valuable dating function since rings from archaeological  sites
              can be matched to master sequences. Tree ring research is  conducted in many
              parts of the world and the results are of value  to a wide range of scientists.
              For these reasons, international  conferences which bring together diverse
              groups of scientists are  extremely important and the 1994 meeting will serve
              this  function.    The amount of dendrochronological research in the developing
               world has increased significantly in recent years. Therefore it  is
              particularly important to have representation from scholars in  these regions.
