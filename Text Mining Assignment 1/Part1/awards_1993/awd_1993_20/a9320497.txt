Abstract    :
              9320497  Grether  Psychologists have identified a number of rules or heuristic
              that  individuals may use in making judgements about the likelihood of 
              uncertain events.  Recent studies in experimental economics and  psychology
              have focused on finding the best fitting model from an  ex ante natural class
              of models to some experimental data in ways  that allow for subject differences
              in decision rules.  But these  data mining exercises limit subjects to a few
              pre-determined  rules.  Proper statistical analysis of these data may be 
              impossible, if patterns of behavior do not fit into one of the  pre-specified
              models.  The contribution of this project comes  from generalizing the single
              model selection approach by allowing  subjects to be explained by different
              models and generalizing the  standard data mining approach by choosing rules
              that best explain  the subjects' behavior from a large potential class of
              rules.      The project develops a procedure for analyzing data on individual 
              choice and market experiments that rigorously estimates the  number of rules
              used by subjects, estimates what those rules are,  and classifies subjects by
              decisionmaking rules used.  The  theoretical and practical aspects of this
              procedure are studied.   The procedure is used to design and conduct
              experiments that can  best discriminate between different decision rules,
              minimizing  misclassification errors and biases in estimates.  The technique 
              is applied to data from double auction experiments.
