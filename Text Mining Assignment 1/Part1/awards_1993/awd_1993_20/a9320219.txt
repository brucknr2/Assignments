Abstract    :
              9320219  Merchant  Ms. Debora Hammond, working on her doctoral dissertation
              under the  direction of Professor Carolyn Merchant, is examining the emergence 
              of general systems theory by focusing specifically on the four  individuals
              (Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding, Ralph Gerard  and Anatol Rapoport)
              who established the Society for General  Systems Research.  Ms. Hammond's is
              studying the events leading to  the formation of the Society as well as
              influences which the  Society's activities and publications had on developments
              in  various disciplines, particularly in terms of the relationship  between
              biological, psychological, and sociological sciences during  the period from
              1950-1979.  The Society is representative of  several general trends which
              characterize this period, including  efforts to overcome the increasing
              fragmentation of disciplinary  specialization through interdisciplinary
              approaches to problem  solving and a belief that the social sciences could
              benefit from  the same kind of intensive research effort that had proven so 
              successful in the physical sciences during World War II.  Ms.  Hammond is
              evaluating the contributions of this particular group in  the context of
              similar and parallel developments in other fields.  ***
