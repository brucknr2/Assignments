Abstract    :
              9320144  Coulter     The aim of this project is to create a state-of-the-art
              multimedia laboratory.  The hardware component of the laboratory consists of a
              number of multimedia stations connected in the local area network via
              Ethernets.  Besides these hardware elements, the multimedia stations will be
              connected to various accessories needed to run multimedia applications.  In
              addition, there will be software tools for multimedia development and
              application enabling software.      The equipment will be used for a number of
              research projects, in particular for: (1) research and development of
              multimedia operating systems, (2) research and development of multimedia
              synchronization algorithms for distributed systems, and (3) research in
              multimedia videoconferencing systems.      The research in multimedia operating
              systems will explore techniques to transform traditional operating systems into
              a high-performance multimedia operating system.  In the area of multimedia
              synchronization algorithms, a new synchronization algorithm will be developed
              with an idea to combine two techniques: protocol-based synchronization and
              local synchronization.  The building of a multimedia conferencing system
              involves measuring timing and resource usage, and evaluating critical issues
              such as video compression and decompression, and resource synchronization and
              mixing.  ***             SCR           @ j    D  TADA    WAV           @ j &  l
