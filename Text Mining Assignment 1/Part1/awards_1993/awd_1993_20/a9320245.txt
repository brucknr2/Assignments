Abstract    :
                          9320245  Rameau  This is a travel award for an exploratory visit to
              Harvard  University, University of Texas Anderson Cancer center, and the 
              University of California, San Diego.  This travel will provide  opportunities
              to meet faculty and examine facilities at each  location.  The purpose of the
              visits is to facilitate discussion  of potential postdoctoral training, and
              tentative planning of  scientific research to be pursued.  Professors Daniel
              Harber,  Eric Olson, and Michael Karin at the respective universities each 
              have invited him to visit their laboratory for this purpose, and  in ultimately
              serving as his mentor.  ***
