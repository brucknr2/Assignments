Abstract    :
              9320120  Town  Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the principal naturally-occurring 
              member of a class of plant growth hormones known as auxins.  IAA is  involved
              in a wide range of plant processes including cell growth  and differentiation,
              fruit development and senescence.  In plants,  most of the IAA occurs not as
              the free acid, but conjugated either  to various sugars via ester linkages or
              to amino acids or peptides  via amide bonds, the latter form of conjugate being
              more prevalent  in most dicots.  Several roles have been postulated for auxin 
              conjugates, including storage for use during germination, IAA  homeostasis, and
              even tissue targeting.  Various lines of evidence  suggest that auxin
              conjugates are active only after hydrolysis to  free auxin.  Despite the
              obvious importance of auxin in the plant,  and the potential significance of
              the much larger reservoir of  conjugated auxin, very little is known about the
              biochemistry and  even less about the molecular biology or genetics of the
              synthesis  or degradation of IAA conjugates.  In this proposal, several 
              approaches will be used to isolate genes involved in IAA conjugate  metabolism.
               This laboratory has recently isolated a cDNA encoding  a conjugate hydrolyzing
              activity by a yeast complementation  strategy.  The principal focus of this
              proposal is to characterize  many facets of the structure, expression and
              biological function of  this activity in Arabidopsis.  As time permits, other
              studies on  conjugate function and metabolism which were ongoing prior to the 
              cDNA isolation will also be continued.  ***
