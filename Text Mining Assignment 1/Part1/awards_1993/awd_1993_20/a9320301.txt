Abstract    :
              9320301  Yau, Libgober    This award provides support a joint U.S.-China Seminar
              on  Singularities and Complex Geometry.  U.S. Principal Investigators  Stephen
              Yau and Anatoly Libgober of the University of Illinois at  Chicago and Lu
              Qikeng, Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy  of Sciences, have organized
              a joint seminar to be held in  Beijing, China on singularities and complex
              geometry, which is an  active area of research in algebraic geometry with
              implications  for diverse areas of science ranging from elementary particle 
              physics to fields of engineering.  The geometry of complex  analytic spaces
              continues to warrant considerable attention in  pure mathematics and in recent
              years, both the conceptual and  technical aspects of the subject have become
              increasingly  important in several areas of modern mathematical physics.    The
              principal investigators are known as leading authorities in  this area, and
              maintain active research programs.  Participants  on both sides include a mix
              of senior and junior researchers,  with the expectation that channels of
              communication will be  opened between the new generation of mathematicians in
              both  countries.  It is anticipated that given the development of  China's very
              independent mathematical school, and its limited  contact with the West, new
              viewpoints and mathematical techniques  will be obtained through this proposed
              interaction.    Support recommended includes airfare for twelve U.S. 
              participants, local travel, and modest organizational fees.   China's National
              Natural Science Foundation and Academy of  Sciences will support Chinese
              participation and the local  subsistence costs of U.S. researchers in China for
              the duration  of the seminar.
