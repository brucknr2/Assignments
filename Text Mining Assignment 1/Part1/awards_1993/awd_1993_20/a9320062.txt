Abstract    :
              9320062  Plous  Animal research has played a central role in psychology, yet its
               applied value and ethical propriety has recently come under attack.   The
              purpose of the present proposal is to conduct a large-scale  survey of
              professional and student opinion concerning the use of  animals in
              psychological research and education.  The investigation  will focus mainly on
              the following six questions:  (1)  How  widespread is support for animal
              research within the professional  community?  (2)  How strongly do psychology
              students support animal  research?  (3)  Which findings from animal research
              are seen as  most useful?  (4)  What objections are most common among critics
              of  animal experimentation?  (5)  Does support for animal research  differ
              among demographic subpopulations?  (6)  Do students and  faculty support the
              use of animals in education?  The primary  research approach will be to survey
              5000 randomly selected  psychologists from the American Psychological
              Association, as well  as 2000 students drawn from a national sample of colleges
              and  universities.  Results from this survey are intended to illuminate 
              several questions critical to the infrastructure of science and  education
              within psychology, including questions of funding,  research priorities,
              government and institutional regulations,  ideal curricula, and differences in
              opinion between students and  psychology faculty.  Results will be reported at
              meetings and in  appropriate professional journals.  ***
