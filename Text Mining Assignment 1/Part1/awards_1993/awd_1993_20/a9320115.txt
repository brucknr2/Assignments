Abstract    :
              9320115  Fraser   Tourism in Antarctica has been showing a steady increase since
              the  late 1960's. Despite rising concern that human activity may  negatively
              impact wildlife populations, studies designed to address  this issue have been
              lacking. The purpose of this Small Grant for  Exploratory Research is to
              examine the feasibility of coupling  research on the effects of tourism on
              Adelie Penguin populations on  Torgersen island, Antarctic Peninsula, with two
              long-term  ecosystem-oriented programs already in existence in the area. The 
              rationale for this approach is based on the premise that  understanding and
              defining the natural variability inherent in the  ecosystem is a necessary
              prerequisite for identifying and  interpreting the effects of human activity.
              By employing identical  technologies and methodologies, this study seeks to
              develop  identical, coincident databases at sites visited by tourists to 
              compare with databases developed as part of the two ecosystem  studies at sites
              not visited by tourists. The latter will thus  provide the background ecosystem
              data needed to discern and  interpret the former. This arrangement, if
              successful, is likely to  establish the proposed research as one of the key
              studies  addressing human impacts in Antarctica, and serve as a model for 
              future research of a similar nature. The award will help fulfill  the National
              Science Foundation's responsibility and obligations  for environmental
              protection under the Antarctic Conservation Act  of 1978.  ***
