Abstract    :
              9320066  Green     The equipment purchased will be dedicated to support research
              in analog and digital VLSI.  It will be used for several projects, including in
              particular: design of fully differential current-mode circuits that do not need
              common-mode feedback; design of analog IC's for radiation detection systems;
              research of superconducting technologies for the design of extremely high-speed
              oversampling analog-to-digital converters.     The test and measurement
              equipment to be purchased includes a distortion analyzer, a semiconductor
              parameter analyzer and a color plotter.  The distortion analyzer will be used
              in the design of fully differential current-mode circuits and the design of
              analog IC's for radiation detection systems.  It is essential for obtaining
              precise values of low-level noise and distortion present in analog integrated
              circuits.  The semiconductor parameter analyzer will also be used in these
              projects to obtain measurement of the characteristics of individual devices and
              subcircuits (e.g., a differential pair).  Such measurements are needed to
              determine the effects of individual device parameters on the performance of an
              overall large circuit.  The color plotter is to be used on all three of the
              projects in order to check the circuit layouts for errors before submitting the
              chip to the foundry.  This is particularly important for analog circuits which
              generally cannot be fully checked using tools optimized for checking digital
              circuits.  ***            E  B  TERMINALHLP           @ j       9320066  Green
