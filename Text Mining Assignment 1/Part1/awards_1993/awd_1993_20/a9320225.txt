Abstract    :
              9320225  Seidman     This instrumentation award supports the purchase of a
              distributed-memory multiprocessor to support research in computer science,
              computer engineering, and electrical engineering.  The equipment will be used
              for several research projects, including the development of a comprehensive
              parallelization system for MIMD multiprocessors, design and performance
              evaluation of mechanisms for parallel discrete event simulation, and
              development of parallel algorithms for simulation of two-dimensional radio
              frequency glow discharge.     Research on graph-based parallelizing compiler
              technology at Auburn University has already produced tools to perform
              dependence analysis and SSA-PDG transformations, along with graph partitioning
              and task scheduling.  The next step for the project is the analysis of the
              parallel code produced by the tools, and this step requires a dedicated
              multiprocessor.     At Auburn University, research on parallel and distributed
              discrete event simulation includes the study of benchmarks  for conservative
              and optimistic simulation mechanisms, the analysis of optimistic (Time Warp)
              mechanisms under realistic conditions, and the investigation of new hybrid
              mechanisms.  All of these research directions require the availability of a
              distributed-memory multiprocessor.     The use of simulation to study
              radio-frequency glow discharges is computationally intensive.  Most previous
              work in this area is limited to one-dimensional simulations, which do not
              provide sufficient realistic details.  The availability of a distributed-memory
              multiprocessor will make it possible to perform two-dimensional simu lations
              with reasonable turnaround time.  ***                            X
