Abstract    :
              9320539  Pak  The aim of this project is to improve the current understanding 
              of dynamic soil-foundation interaction, from theory to practice,  focusing on
              shallow building foundations embedded in  granular  soils.    The objectives
              are to: (1) examine and delineate the  applicability of existing analytical and
              numerical solutions to  the physical problem, (2) perform thorough parametric
              studies to  clarify the influence of important foundation and soil parameters 
              on the dynamic response, (3) identify and adapt relevant existing  theories to
              granular soil conditions by calibration, and (4)  develop more comprehensive
              solutions and formulas to deal with  the stress-induced heterogeneous soil
              conditions intrinsic to  this class of problems.    To achieve these goals, a
              fundamental series of experiments will  be conducted on a geotechnical
              centrifuge.  The interest is in  determining the foundation response in
              vertical, horizontal, and  rocking modes under earthquake and random loading. 
              Particular  attention is given to the development of a comprehensive data set 
              on the effects of: (i) foundation size, (ii) static foundation  load, (iii)
              nonlinearities due to dynamic excitation levels, (iv)  foundation shape, (v)
              embedment, and (vi) intrinsic and global  parameters on the dynamic response.  
               In addition to furnishing the much-needed physical basis for  further
              theoretical and numerical developments, this research  will allow the
              derivation of direct semi-empirical relationships  which can be of immediate
              value to designers.  ***
