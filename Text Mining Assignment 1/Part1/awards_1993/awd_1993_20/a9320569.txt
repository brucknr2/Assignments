Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at the University of Tennessee--Knoxville   will use
              this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program   to help
              purchase a mass spectrometer data handling system.  The areas of   chemical
              research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the   following: 
              characterization of biochemical systems, including   farnesylated proteins and
              aberrant enzymes potentially linked with   carcinogenesis, fundamental studies
              of fullerene chemistry, gas-phase ion   chemistry, nonlinear chromatography and
              kinetics monitoring.    Mass spectrometry is a technique used to probe intimate
              structural   details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array
              of   organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules.  The acquisition of a  
              mass spectrometer is essential for the prosecution of frontier research   in
              many fields in chemistry, and a modern data handling improves the   instrument
              control and the efficiency of the facility.
