Abstract    :
              9320513  Horowitz    This is a research planning grant, the first phase of a
              study of  the positions of professional and consumer groups on whether  there
              should be representatives of the public on boards of  medical practice.  It
              will employ a range of methodological  approaches, including interviews,
              analysis of documents, and  field observations from public meetings.  From
              these diverse  sources, a quantitative questionnaire will be developed that
              will  be the heart of a major research study.  Among the chief policy-  related
              aims of the project are to increase our presently limited  knowledge about the
              functioning of medical regulatory boards, and  to explore means of making these
              boards more accountable to the  public.  The research will explore new
              intellectual territory in  the sociological sub-disciplines of professions,
              public  regulation, and authority relations.  %%%  This work is supported under
              the Research Planning Grant program  for women scientists and engineers, and
              thus among its chief aims  are to assist a promising woman social scientist to
              prepare for a  major research project, and to expand the scientific personnel
              of  the United States.  The results of this study will be valuable  for
              policy-makers attempting to revamp the American system of  health care delivery
              over the coming years.    ***
