Abstract    :
              9320297  Cole     The Center for Spoken Language Understanding at the Oregon
              Graduate Institute of Science and Technology will purchase a file server and
              disks to support research in computer and information science and engineering. 
              The equipment will be used for several research projects, including: language
              identification, collection of census via telephone, voice server for spoken
              interaction with computers, and research on robustness in speech recognition.  
                The collection and transcription of telephone speech in many different
              languages enables basic research in automatic language identification and the
              development of multi-language spoken language systems.       The current file
              server at the Center has reached it's disk limit.  The projects listed require
              significant amounts of new data.  Some have budgeted disks which will not fit
              in the current server.  Others require storage not yet available.  The new
              server and disks will have a much greater capacity and throughput than the old,
              and will allow the Center to continue collecting data and developing algorithms
              for these projects and for the whole speech research community.  ***
