Abstract    :
              9320299  Pearson     This award will provide funds to purchase multiprocessor
              computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in
              computer and information science and engineering.  The equipment will be used
              for several research projects including in particular:  "High Performance
              Input/Output for Parallel Computing Systems", "Distributed Simulation of the
              Nonstationary Behavior of Communication Networks", "Performance Validation of
              Nonlinear Controllers for Electric Machines via Dynamic Simulation", 
              "Efficient Multi-Processor Computations in Electromagnetics", and "Real-World
              EMC/EMI Analysis using Finite Elements and Multi-Processor Workstations".    
              Each of these projects involves the development and use of large
              computation-intensive simulations that require many hours of dedicated
              processor time, large main memory, and large local I/O capacity.  The use of
              the equipment will be restricted to those faculty and students involved in
              these projects, and will be accessed via an existing ethernet as a dedicated
              compute server.  The multiprocessor configuration will allow resources to be
              allocated among the processors as needed to provide effective use of the system
              and will allow computations to be run in parallel on many processors more
              efficiently than alternative configurations. In each case, by providing needed
              additional processing power, the system will improve the throughput of the
              large scale computations involved in these projects, thereby enabling more
              effective research.  ***            Pearson     This award will provide funds
