Abstract    :
              9320701  Krivo         This is a study of racial residential segregation, social
               isolation and homicide.  It will examine the extent to which  black and white
              urban homicide rates are a consequence of the  high levels of racial
              residential segregation in American cities.   Research will assess two sets of
              hypotheses: 1) Which of a  variety of aspects of residential segregation are
              related to  race-specific patterns of homicide in central cities.  2) What 
              specific factors link racial residential segregation to rates of  lethal
              violence.  The primary data are from the 1980 and 1990  censuses of population
              and homicide incidence files compiled by  the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
              and the samples will consist  of central cities with at least 100,000
              population and 5,000  blacks for each year.  %%%       This research will
              illuminate how and why the high levels of  racial residential segregation found
              in most American cities are  related to one of the most serious urban problems:
              high homicide  rates, especially for African-Americans.  The study will also 
              advance our understanding of the consequences of concentrated  poverty and
              social isolation of urban blacks by assessing to what  degree these pattern
              contribute to criminal violence.    ***
