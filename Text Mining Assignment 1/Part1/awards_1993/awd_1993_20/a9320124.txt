Abstract    :
              9320124  Bodenschatz    Technical abstract:  The investigation is concerned with
              the  thermal convection of pressurized gases in an inclined layer.  This 
              system has been chosen since it is ideally suited for the study of 
              multiparameter bifurcations in anisotropic pattern-forming systems.  An
              experiment in convection of pressurized gases, opposed to, for  example,
              electroconvection of liquid crystals (EC), has the major  advantage that the
              fundamental equations describing the fluid flow  are well understood. 
              Pressurized gases allow experiments  (similarly to EC) in large systems, where
              boundary effects are weak  and much of the spatial degrees of freedom are
              retained.  In  addition, by changing the temperature and pressure a wide range
              in  parameters can be achieved.  The weakly nonlinear region will be 
              investigated and quantitatively compared with recent theoretical 
              investigations.    Non-technical abstract:  The aim of this research is th 
              experimental investigation of nonlinear, non-equilibrium pattern-  forming
              phenomena.  As a paradigm buoyancy-driven convective flow  in a fluid layer
              which is inclined with respect to the horizontal  will be studied.  This system
              is of great interest from a physics  point of view as well as of major
              importance in heating and cooling  technology.  By using pressurized gases at
              ambient temperatures as  working fluids convection cells with unprecedented
              large system  sizes under well controlled boundary conditions can be realized. 
               It is expected that boundary effects will be weak and much of the  spatial
              degrees of freedom will be retained.  The research will  allow a detailed
              quantitative comparison with recent theoretical  investigations.  ***
