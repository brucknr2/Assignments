Abstract    :
                     9320432  Hill   This project involves an award of funds to the PhD 
              program in cultural anthropology at UCLA for the  purpose of supporting
              students' fieldwork before their  dissertation research begins.  Students will
              be  mentored by faculty as they do preliminary field  research to prepare for
              their dissertation research.   This project is important because it improves
              the  scientific abilities of students, and thus the  scientific strength of the
              US, through providing  experience and practice in research situations.  ***
