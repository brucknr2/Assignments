Abstract    :
              9320378  Grier    Technical abstract:  The experimental program addresses the
              physics  of colloidal suspensions through a combination of digital video 
              microscopy, optical trapping, and laser light scattering.  Systems  to be
              investigated include highly charged polystyrene microspheres  and
              superparamagnetic ferrofluid emulsion droplets.  Areas of  particular interest
              include:  (1) precision measurements of the  interparticle potential; (2)
              analysis of structural and dynamical  processes responsible for phase
              transitions in supercooled  monodisperse colloidal suspensions; (3) analysis of
              phase  transitions in bidisperse colloidal suspensions focusing on 
              metastability of disordered solids; (4) effects of phase behavior  of modulated
              substrate potentials simulated by optical interference  patterns; (5)
              microscopic kinetics of phase transitions in quenced  single-layer ferrofluid
              emulsions.    Non-technical abstract:  The experimental program examines 
              colloidal suspensions on three levels:  (1) as distinct states of  matter; (2)
              as easily studied analogs for conventional materials  and (3) for their
              self-ordering properties which hold promise for  nanofabrication, nonlinear
              optics, and other advanced applications.   Anticipated practical benefits
              include (1) a method for determining  the microscale interactions in commercial
              colloidal suspensions;  (2) improved understanding of the "atomic"-scale
              processes  responsible for phase transitions, particularly in the 
              technologically important case of rapid solidification; and (3)  improved
              understanding of the microscopic structure, dynamics, and  phase transitions of
              binary alloy systems.  ***
