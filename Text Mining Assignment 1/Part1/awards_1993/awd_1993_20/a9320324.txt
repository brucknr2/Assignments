Abstract    :
              9320324 Wright Late-Quaternary sediment records from climate sensitive, closed
              basin lakes in tropical East Africa are testimony to the complexity of climate
              history at time scales ranging from millennia to years. High resolution
              reconstruction of the underlying history of African continental paleoclimates
              is complicated by individualistic response of the lakes to short-term climate
              change because of variation in indirect climate effects, lake levels, and
              salinity. This dissertation research will improve high resolution
              interpretation of complex sedimentary records by (1) conducting a detailed
              paleolimnological study of recent climate-caused environmental change in a
              system of four interconnected lake basins, (2) investigating the ecological
              sensitivity and patterns of species replacement in the lacustrine invertebrate
              communities of these shallow lake ecosystems, and (3) establishing the analysis
              of fossil assemblages of these lacustrine invertebrates as a tool in high
              resolution paleoclimate reconstruction. %%% Results from this dissertation
              research will be applied to the high resolution reconstruction of a strongly
              debated but poorly documented episode in climatic history of east Africa and
              other tropical regions: the last millennium which may include tropical
              equivalents of the Midieval Warm Epoch and the Little Ice Age. Much of what we
              know about climate change modeling at small spatial scales derives from
              paleolimnological studies such as this. The attempts to increase the temporal
              resolution of climate reconstruction will be invaluable for understanding and
              predicting future patterns of climate change within the the context of natural,
              short-term climatic variation. ***
