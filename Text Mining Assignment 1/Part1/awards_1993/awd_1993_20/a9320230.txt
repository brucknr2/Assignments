Abstract    :
              Support is recommended for the conference "Unified Symmetry:  in the small and
              in the large" to be held at Coral Gables,  Florida on January 27-30, 1994.   
              This conference program will include presentations and  discussions on the
              unification of gauge fields.  Gauge  symmetries are the best known approach to
              unification of  Physical theories.  This conference program will include 
              presentations of updated searches for elementary particles,  more data of
              recent measurements of the cosmic background  radiation, large scale structure,
              electroweak baryogenesis,  news from Hubble Space Telescope, dark matter,
              monopoles,  cosmic strings, symmetries in astrophysics and in cosmology.
