Abstract    :
              9320480   Graves       The first and second Material Handling Research Colloquia
              each  brought together forty researchers in the field of material  handling to
              focus on the current state of research in material  handling and the critical
              issues to be addressed in the last decade  of the 20th century and the first
              decade of the 21st century.  The  goal of this project is to continue the
              effort of the very  successful first two research colloquia.  These continue to
              build  better communication within the material handling research  community by
              providing a venue for academic and industrial  researchers to network with each
              other about material handling  issues.
