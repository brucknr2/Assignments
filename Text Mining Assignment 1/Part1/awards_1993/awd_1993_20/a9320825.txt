Abstract    :
              9320825  Krishna  This research will develop theoretical models of trade in an 
              effort to understand the different effects of trade policy,  especially when
              markets are imperfectly competitive. Most  often the effects of policy depend
              on paying particular  attention to the details of the implementation procedure.
               This study focuses on three main areas where the details of  implementation
              are clearly important. The first is an  investigation of export quotas, in an
              effort to ascertain  whether transferability of licenses is welfare enhancing. 
              The conventional wisdom is that transferable quotas are  preferable to
              nontransferable ones. A simple model is  developed to show that contrary to
              conventional wisdom,  license prices could increase or decrease depending on
              the  quota level and the extent of free quota. The second part of  the study
              deals with issues of market access. There has  recently been increasing
              pressure to create rules to ensure  market access. The effort here is to find
              out if attempts to  assure a minimum market share for U.S. products help or
              hurt  its competitiveness in the long-run. Finally, the study  conducts an
              analysis of the rules of origin used in Free  Trade Agreements. These rules of
              origin are used to  determine whether a good is produced in a Free Trade Area 
              and hence eligible for preferential treatment of the Free  Trade Area or not. 
              This project is of significant interest because it allows a  better
              understanding of the implications of different  implementation procedures. The
              findings from the study are  also important in more general settings as well.
              For  example, the issue of the effects of permitting  transferability is
              relevant for all types of permits from  pollution permits to permits to run a
              taxicab.  ***
