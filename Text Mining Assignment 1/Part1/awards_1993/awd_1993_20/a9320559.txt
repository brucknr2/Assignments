Abstract    :
                            9320559  YOUNG  This  project  seeks  to  add  to  our 
              understanding  of  regime  formation   in   international  society  by  
              focusing   on   the  prenegociation stages of international relations in  the 
              Arctic.  The  prenegociation stage covers the process through which issues 
              initially  find  their way into international political  agendas,  are
              considered in international forums, and rise to prominence in  international 
              negociations.  The  project  involves  a  detailed  analysis  of  four  current
              cases: (1) The  Arctic  Environmental  Protection Strategy, (2) The Euro-Arctic
              Barents Region, (3)  The  Arctic  Council, and (4) the Bering Sea Region.  The 
              study  will  examine  a series of hypotheses about the forces at work  in  the 
              prenegociation  stages,  including  the  influence  of  non-state  actors and
              the role of individual leaders.  ***
