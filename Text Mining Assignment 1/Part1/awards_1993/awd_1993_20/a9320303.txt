Abstract    :
              9320303  Thorp  The Mississippi  River and some of its tributaries are currently
              experiencing catastrophic floods which have significantly modified their
              typical hydrological patterns.  The ecological impacts of an extreme flood
              occurring outside of the normal flood period should have substantial effects on
              this important lotic ecosystem, such as altering normal patterns of input,
              storage, and transport of organic matter and nutrients.  In addition, sources
              of organic matter which are not normally available may be introduced onto the
              river at this time.  These changes in nutrient supply and timing should act as
              a major disturbance to the trophic dynamics of the Mississippi River ecosystem.
               We hypothesize that the catastrophic flood presently occurring in the
              Mississippi River ecosystem will produce a shift in normal trophic processes by
              altering the role of different sources of organic matter in the riverine food
              web.  This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating the stable-isotope ratios in
              the food webs of four rivers (two flooded and two unflooded, flood plain
              rivers).  During three dates over a year period, we will collect 5 replicates
              of 21 sample units per river, each representing a nutrient source of organic
              processor.  We will then determine the composition of 13C and 15N and C/N ratio
              in the sample units.  To ascertain whether changes in the Mississippi River
              Ecosystem over time reflect the effects of the flood or merely represent normal
              seasonal variations, we will obtain samples from four rivers:  the Missouri and
              upper Mississippi Rivers, which are currently experiencing the worst floods of
              the century, and the Ohio and Wabash Rivers, which are flood plain rivers that
              have not been inundated by flood waters.  Information from this study will
              contribute to a data base useful for making management decisions involving the
              role of flood plains in river ecosystems.
