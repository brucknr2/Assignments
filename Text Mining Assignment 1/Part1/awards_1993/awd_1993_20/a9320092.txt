Abstract    :
              9320092  Welch  This is an award to support research on the role of
              invertebrates  in controlling the proliferation of filamentous nuisance algae
              in  rubble-bed, natural streams that receive nutrients from point and  nonpoint
              sources.  Experimental work is planned using laboratory  channels and at three
              sites in nutrient-enriched, natural  streams.  The laboratory channels will be
              used to determine the  effectiveness of grazing over a range in grazer sizes
              and their  abundance and the extent to which enrichment level affects grazer 
              effectiveness.  Grazing rates will be used to modify an existing  model that
              can be used to predict the expected maximum periphyton  biomass concentration
              as a function of reactive phosphorus  concentration using assumptions of
              available light, temperature  and current velocity in the receiving stream.   
              The results of this project are expected to provide knowledge  that can be
              applied in determination of the extent to which  nutrient removal is necessary
              to meet acceptable conditions for  discharge of effluents from domestic and
              industrial wastewater  treatment plants into flowing streams and addressing the
               development of nuisance conditions in streams resulting from  nonpoint sources
              of nutrients.  The results of this research may  be applied in location of
              treatment plants, approaches to dealing  with nonpoint sources of nutrients and
              in the engineering design  of systems for dealing with the flow of nutrients
              into natural  streams.  ***
