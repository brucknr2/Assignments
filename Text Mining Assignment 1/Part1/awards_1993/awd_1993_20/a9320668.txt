Abstract    :

              Chemistry Program for studies related to asymmetric synthesis and catalysis.
              New methods for asymmetric and regioselective syntheses will be developed using
              metal complexes. These will include an efficient stoichiometric reagent for the
              preparation of monallylic alcohols based on a chiral Mo complex, the use of
              chiral poisons to simplify the preparation of catalysts for asymmetric
              synthesis, and the development of chiral sulfoxides for the resolution of
              chiral metal complexes.  An object which is not the same as its mirror image
              (e.g. a left compared to a right handed glove) is said to be chiral.  Many
              pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals are chiral and often only one of the
              two mirror image molecules is desired. Since it is difficult to obtain a single
              mirror image, the production of such molecules is an important goal in
              contemporary chemistry. In this project new strategies toward solving the
              problem of "asymmetric synthesis" will be applied to a broad range of reactions
              and new, more economic preparations of  these important molecules will be
              developed.
