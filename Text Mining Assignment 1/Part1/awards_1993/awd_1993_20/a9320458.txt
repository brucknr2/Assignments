Abstract    :
              9320458  Bayless    This SBIR Phase II proposal addresses the problem of
              developing a novel, sealed, source of 14 MeV (or 2.5 MeV) neutrons which can
              operate at high output flux with long life.  The Intense Pulsed Discharge (IPD)
              neutron source uses a simple cold-cathode ion generator and a distributed ion
              extraction geometry to deliver a high fraction of atomic deuterium ions at
              energies of 200 keV to a tritium-loaded target.  Neutrons with energies in the
              range of 14 MeV are generated through D-T (T(D, n)4 He) fusion reactions; 2.5
              MeV deuterium-loaded target.    The basic feasibility of the IPD neutron source
              concept was demonstrated in a SBIR Phase I project that included ion beam
              experiments and conceptual design development.    Phase II will complete the
              feasibility demonstration by constructing and operating a 200 kV laboratory
              prototype IPD neutron source system.  This project includes: (1) optimization
              of the ion generator; (2) design and assembly of a sealed 200 kV IPD neutron
              source; (3) source characterization with hydrogen; (4) operation with deuterium
              and measurement of the 2.5 MeV neutron flux resulting from D-D reactions (the
              14 MeV flux can be projected from this); and (5) life testing with the goal of
              operational life of 300 hours under conditions representative of a D-T neutron
              flux of 5x10 12 n/sec (>50 times greater than available with commercial sealed
              sources) and a flux density of 3x10 10 n/cm2-sec.    ***
