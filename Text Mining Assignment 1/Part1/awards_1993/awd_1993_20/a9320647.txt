Abstract    :
              9320647  Toole   The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue an 
              instrument development program to design, construct and test a  moored
              instrumentation profiling system that can repeatedly  transport a suite of
              scientific sensors or an instrument package  vertically through the water
              column to full ocean depths.  Initial  prototype evaluations were successful in
              testing the feasibility of  a building a profiling system designed to
              repeatedly profile to  depths of 6000 meters and to obtain a time series
              temperature,  salinity, current velocity, or other measurements.  Such a system
               will provide valuable data at relatively low cost compared to  current
              shipboard data acquisition systems.  The system could also  be deployed in
              remote locations that are seldom traversed by  oceanographic research vessels.
