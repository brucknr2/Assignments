Abstract    :
              9320325  Krishna     The equipment funded by this award will be used for several
              research projects, including in particular the following:    (1) VLSI
              Arithmetic Arrays for Digital Signal Processing: Methodologies and tools for
              analyzing and comparing design alternatives at various levels of abstraction
              are being developed.  Part of the work consists of implementing chip designs
              using the fabrication facilities of the Massachusetts Microelectronics Center
              and MOSIS.      (2) High-Performance VLSI Synthesis with Wave Pipelining: Wave
              pipelining is a custom circuit design method which has previously been used in
              hand-crafted designs.  This technique is being incorporated in CAD tools for
              the automatic synthesis of high-performance VLSI circuits.      (3) Testable
              Non-Scan Sequential Circuits: Design and development methodology for sequential
              circuits are being done so that most path delay faults can be detected.  To
              avoid performance degradation, any circuitry added to enhance testability is
              not allowed to be in functional paths.    (4) Reconfiguration of Real-Time
              Distributed Systems: Reconfiguration is a powerful method to improve the
              performance of distributed systems.  Currently, it has largely been used only
              to react to component failures.  In this project, techniques are being
              developed to configure the system as a function of the prevailing workload so
              that the performance is optimized.        (5) Topological and Physical Layout
              Design Techniques for Yield Enhancement: The greater integration levels and die
              sizes in integrated circuits have increased the need for yield enhancement.  In
              this project, design techniq ues are being developed to improve the yield of
              larger chips, so as to fully benefit from the advantages of higher levels of
              integration.    ***             (          kT        3COM                   t
