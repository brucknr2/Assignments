Abstract    :
                               9320102            Cohen              This project involves the
              dissertation research of a cultural            anthropology student from
              Columbia University.  The student will            study the nature of the
              transformation of traditional Chinese            families in a rural area of
              northeast China.  Using ethnographic            methods of participant
              observation and in-depth interviews, the            student will trace the
              impact on the life and work of families in            one hamlet of land
              reform, marriage laws, the cultural revolution            and other national
              government policies.  The end result will be            an ethnography that
              describes how these rural families have coped            with and responded to
              the national government's efforts to change            them.             This
              research is important because it will add to our base of            studies of
              rural Chinese communities.  This case study of the            successes and
              failures of the national state in changing the            lives of rural
              families will help us understand similar processes            in other areas
              where governments are engaged in drastic            modernization policies. We
              will be better able to respond to            problems and opportunities the
              more we understand about the            reality in these remote rural areas.
