Abstract    :
              9320365  Karasz    Technical Narrative:    This proposed workshop, organized by
              the  University of Massachusetts, Amherst and the  Marmara Research Centre,
              Gebze, Turkey, is  scheduled for 16-18 May 1994 at the Marmara  Research
              Centre.  This activity will bring  together highly regarded experts in the
              field of  polymer solution hydro- and thermodynamics with  the overall
              objective of building international  networks between Turkish scientists and
              their  U.S. counterparts.  It is expected that a full-  scale collaborative
              research proposal will emerge  as a result of this workshop.  This project 
              supports the participation of approximately 10  polymer scientists from the
              U.S.    This workshop in materials research fulfills the  program objective of
              advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading experts in the  United
              States and Turkey to identify critical  variables and methods of analysis in
              theoretical  calculations.  As Turkish graduate students will  also
              participate, this activity has an  educational and outreach effort that has the
               potential for generating new scientific activity  and new international
              linkages.  ***
