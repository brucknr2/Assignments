Abstract    :
              This award is made under the Dissertation Improvement program.   Experimental
              economics has gained prominence as a means of  testing behavioral assumptions
              that underlie much of economic  theory.  A fundamental and frequently used
              assumption in game  theory and decision theory is the assertion that
              individuals use  Bayes' rule to process new information about uncertain events.
                This research investigates the extent to which this assumption is  valid in
              the particular context of information cascades, where  individuals ignore their
              own private information and follow  public information instead.  The results
              will help clarify the  phenomenon of information cascades and assumptions about
              decision  making behavior.
