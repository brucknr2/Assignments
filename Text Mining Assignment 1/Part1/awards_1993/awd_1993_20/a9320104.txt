Abstract    :
              This research will be devoted to the analysis of problems in  the calculus of
              variations in which singular minimizers may arise.  In particular they include
              problems where gap effects like those described under the heading "Lavrentiev
              phenomenon" can arise.       It is anticipated that successful results in this
              investigation may have important consequences in the study of nonlinear elastic
              materials. Thus they have the potential of providing additional expertise in
              the analysis and development of "smart" materials. The effective development of
              such materials could be of considerable aid to our current materials
              technology.
