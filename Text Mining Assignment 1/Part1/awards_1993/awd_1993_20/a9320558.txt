Abstract    :
              9320558  Sun  This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing 
              Program in support of the research of Professor Ya-Ping Sun.  The theme of the
              research is the identification and  characterization of C60 and C70 clusters in
              solid-like states,  solution and supercritical fluids. The solution studies
              will  focus on the excited state properties of the fullerenes,  especially the
              discrepancy between experimental and calculated  transition probabilities for
              both C60 and C70. A mechanism in  which emissions from thermally populated
              low-lying excited  states are assumed will be evaluated by temperature and 
              solvent-dependent investigations. Because of low solubilities  of the
              fullerenes in common solvents, supercritical fluids will  be used in the
              solvent-dependent studies.  The introduction of  supercritical fluids into
              fullerene research will also identify  solvent systems in which variable
              solvent environments can be  created for studies of solvent effects on electron
              and  charge-transfer reactions of fullerenes.    Research on the photophysics
              of fullerenes and fullerene  clusters will advance our general understanding of
              the  excited-state behavior of pi-conjugated molecules and polymers  and will
              impact emerging technologies such as pi-conjugated  polymer-based
              light-emitting diodes.
