Abstract    :
                  9322138  Stevens  This program provides twelve Summer Undergraduate Research
              Experiences (SURE)  Fellowships in the Biological Sciences for each of  two
              years beginning in the summer of  1994.  The program will be managed by the
              Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR).  The  Program will focus its attention
              on this country's approximately 1,000 primarily undergraduate  institutions. 
              Because of their size and/or lack of a long tradition of undergraduate research
              at  these institutions, it has not been possible or practical to establish
              NSF-REU sites at many of  them.  Consequently, a major segment of the academic
              community is precluded from  participation in the NSF's REU program.  A special
              feature of these Fellowships is that the  participating students (and faculty)
              will be linked by a specially developed electronic bulletin  board which the
              students will use weekly to report progress on their research.  The bulletin 
              board will also enable students to share their experiences with each other and
              to pose  questions about their research as the summer progresses.  ***
