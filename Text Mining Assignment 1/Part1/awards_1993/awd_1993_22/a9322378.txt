Abstract    :
                9322378  Newman  This award provides funds to establish a Research Experience
              for Undergraduates site  at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) of
              Michigan State University.  The  program will provide undergraduate students
              the opportunity to participate in an  integrative program in ecological field
              research, which is considered an essential part  of the education of scientists
              with the skills to address complex environmental  problems.  Students will be
              exposed to concepts and techniques from a variety of  subdisciplines, levels of
              ecological organization (genes to landscapes), scales, and  habitats through
              weekly seminars led by resident and visiting researchers.  Weekly  group
              meetings will provide a forum to discuss research ideas and approaches, 
              conceptual aspects of ecology and evolutionary biology, and project proposals. 
              Each  student will develop and conduct an independent project under the
              guidance of a  faculty mentor, which will include all stages of scientific
              inquiry:  identification and  refinement of questions, experimental and
              sampling design, field work, and data  analysis and presentation.  Results will
              be presented to the KBS community at an REU  symposium at the end of the
              summer, and written up in the form of a manuscript for  publication in a
              scientific journal.  ***
