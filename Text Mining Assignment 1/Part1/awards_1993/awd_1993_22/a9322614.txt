Abstract    :
              9322614  Toth       The project involves the study of the classical and semi- 
              classical spectral asymptotics for the C. Neumann problem and   geodesic flows
              on the ellipsoid. In addition, connections between  the generalized asymmetric
              topology and the theory of geodesic   flows will be investigated.       This
              project lies at the interface between analysis and  geometry. The problems are
              naturally related to fluid flow in a  manifold  and important problems of
              acoustic scattering. The  techniques involved cover a wide spectra from
              classical function  theory to the latest results from the geometry of group
              actions.   ***
