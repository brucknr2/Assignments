Abstract    :
              9322334  Spragg  This award provides funds to the Division of Medical Sciences
              at Harvard University  to continue a successful Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates SITE for another  three years.  The Division supervises Ph.D.
              training programs of the Graduate School  of Arts and Sciences for students who
              are engaged in biological research in  laboratories on the Medical School
              campus. This 10 week summer research program  will support 10  undergraduate
              students each summer working in the fields of  microbial biochemistry and
              genetic regulation.  Students will be recruited from a  nation-wide pool, with
              a particular emphasis on recruiting qualified minority students  and women.
              They will have the opportunity to carry out projects in the laboratories of 
              any of 16 Division faculty who are participating in this program. Special
              program  activities include:  weekly student-faculty research seminars to
              discuss the students'  projects, discussions of ethical issues related to the
              project content, and a career  development discussion series.  Division
              minority and majority faculty and graduate  students participate in the
              seminars and ethics discussions, and the program students  are provided with
              additional opportunities to meet other majority and minority research  faculty
              and graduate students in both academic and social settings.  ***
