Abstract    :
              9322517  Gruner    The objective of this US-Hungary research project, between 
              Dr. George Gruner of the University of California, Los Angeles  (UCLA), and Dr.
              A. Janossy of the Hungarian Central Research  Institute for Physics, is to
              examine the low temperature  properties of charge density waves and conduct
              structural and  electronic paramagnetic resonance studies on doped fullerine 
              compounds.  Specifically, two aspects of density wave dynamics  will be
              explored: 1) the dc transport under nonlinear ac  excitation, and 2) the novel
              low temperature dynamical behavior.   Samples for the joint research will be
              prepared at UCLA and  characterized there by dc resistivity and magnetic 
              susceptibility.  Electron paramagnetic resonance and magnetic  field dependent
              transport measurements will be carried out in  Hungary.  Results are expected
              to contribute to our fundamental  knowledge of the properties of low
              dimensional solids.    This project in materials research fulfills the program
              objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in 
              the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary  talents and pool
              research resources in areas of strong mutual  interest and competence.      ***
