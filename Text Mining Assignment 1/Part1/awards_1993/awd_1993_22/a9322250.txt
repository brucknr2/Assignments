Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Florida purchase
              an upgrade of the NMR facilities which will include the   purchase of a medium
              field NMR, and workstation for data handling.  This   equipment will be used in
              the following research projects:  (1)    Catalysts for Acyclic Diene Metathesis
              Polymerization and Reactivity   Studies of Palladium Amide Complexes; (2) 
              Kinetic Effects in Radical,   Diradical, Carbanion, Carbene, and Pericyclic
              Reactions; and (3)  Ketyl   Radical Anion Chemistry.    Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   for the elucidation of
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to   identify unknown substances,
              characterize specific arrangements of atoms   within molecules, and to study
              the dynamics of interactions between   molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is   essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research.
