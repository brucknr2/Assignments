Abstract    :
              93222617  Sternberg       This award supports mathematical research on a range
              of  problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations and  the
              calculus of variations.  The basis for much of the work is  typically an energy
              arising from a model in continuum mechanics.  Physical contexts include
              superconductivity and phase  transitions.  In all cases, the structure of
              minimizers of the  energy is an issue of primary interest.  Beyond this, work
              will  be done on gradient flows associated with the energy.  The flows  are
              modeled by parabolic partial differential equations or  systems whose solution
              tend to decrease the energy.  A primary  goal is to characterize the large-time
              behavior of these systems  as they strive to achieve an equilibrium state.  In
              all cases,  certain geometric structures tend to characterize steady-state 
              solutions such as minimal surfaces or vortices and one seeks to  understand how
              such structures propagatein time during the late  stages of the evolution.     
               Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the
              physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create
              the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information
              about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these
              approximations.  Many  equations arise by invoking physical principles, phrased
              in terms  of minimizing certain quantities, such as energy.  The resulting 
              mathematical expression is a variational problems whose solution  is expressed
              by a partial differential equation.  ***
