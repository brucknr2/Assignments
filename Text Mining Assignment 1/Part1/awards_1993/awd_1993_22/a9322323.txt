Abstract    :
              9322323  Mendillo         The projected impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with
              the planet  Jupiter offers an unprecedented opportunity to study a wide range 
              of possible effects in atmospheric science and space plasma  physics.  Dr.
              Mendillo will search for signatures on the largest  known spatial scale
              associated with the planet - the sodium  magneto-nebula that spans 1000 Jovian
              radii.  He will conduct an  intense 3-week imaging campaign to document the
              state of the  magneto-nebula prior to, during, and following the encounter date
               in July 1994.  Possible disruption of the plasma-neutral  interactions in the
              Io plasma torus and sodium cloud that drive the  great nebula bring unique
              "active experiment" investigation  techniques to planetary atmosphere research.
