Abstract    :
                  9322205  Barnwell  This award provides funds to the College of Biological
              Sciences at the University of  Minnesota, St. Paul to establish a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates SITE for three  years.  Each summer, 10
              undergraduate students will be selected from a pool of 600-700  applicants to
              spend ten weeks completing an independent research project under the direction 
              of one of the 24 faculty mentors affiliated with the program.  At least half of
              the participants  will be students of color and at least half will be from
              institutions other than the University of  Minnesota.  Mentors in this program
              are basic scientists who have a common interest in  research related to water
              quality and the analyses of physical, chemical and biological  processes that
              occur in lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands.  The students' research
              experience  will be supplemented by weekly student seminars and faculty
              discussions of current research  topics.  The faculty discussions will provide
              students with the most current information on  specific topics as well as
              background terminology and concepts.  All students will prepare a  summary of
              their research project in the form of a display for a poster session at the 
              conclusion of the program.  ***
