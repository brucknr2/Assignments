Abstract    :
                9322251  Brinkley  This award provides funds to Baylor College of Medicine
              (BCM) to continue a  successful REU Program.  Ten college undergraduates
              selected from a  nationwide pool of hundreds of applicants will be exposed to a
              research  atmosphere for 10 weeks in a summer career development program.  
              Participants will be selected by a committee of faculty from basic science 
              departments.  Students will be matched with faculty mentors and become 
              functioning members of their labs.  The unifying focus of the REU Site will  be
              cellular signal transduction.  The faculty of BCM have already gained 
              experience in designing undergraduate research projects and interacting with 
              college students through participation in a five-year program, two years as an 
              REU Site.  Students will be matched by interest and background to a project 
              that will promote learning new technical skills and development of an 
              understanding of how to approach and conduct research.  Students will use 
              advanced techniques, often in molecular biology, that may not be available on 
              their home campuses.  The laboratory oriented aspect of the program will be 
              supplemented by participation in research discussions, seminars, career 
              development activities and social/cultural activities sponsored by  the SMART
              Program.  NSF sponsored participants will have the benefit of  interacting with
              100 undergraduates from throughout the nation and of  entering an established
              program that effectively promotes interest in science  and prepares
              undergraduates to enter research oriented careers.  ***
