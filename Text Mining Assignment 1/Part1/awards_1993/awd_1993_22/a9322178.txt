Abstract    :
              9322178  Alexander  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is
              based on  the premise that the ideal place to supplement the basic education 
              of bioengineers with practical experience and expose them to "real-  life"
              situations of the sort that will characterize their future  careers is in the
              intense medical environment of a teaching  hospital.  Such experience is
              critical to the education of  engineers and scientists who will create new
              concepts and develop,  design, and manufacture medical devices.  Such training
              is  necessary to maintain and expand the competitive edge enjoyed by  the U.S.
              medical device industry, whose products are recognized as  being the world's
              best.  The program's projects, chosen from  ongoing Departmental research
              activities with independent funding  sources, will involve ligament and
              cartilage repair, spinal  fixation, fracture repair, physical chemistry of
              biomineralization,  mechanical and electronmagnetic effects on tissue growth,
              and total  joint design.  ***
