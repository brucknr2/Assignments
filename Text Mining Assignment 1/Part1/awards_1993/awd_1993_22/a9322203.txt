Abstract    :
              9322203  Kampmeier  University of Rochester  Dr. Jack A. Kampmeier and other
              members of the Chemistry Department of the University of  Rochester are being
              supported for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates  (REU) site in 
              Chemistry.  For the period 1994-6, ten undergraduate students will spend ten
              weeks each  summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects. 
              Projects cover the traditional areas  of chemistry-analytical, inorganic,
              organic, physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature of this  site is the
              interaction with the NSF Science and Technology Center for Photoinduced Charge 
              Transfer.
