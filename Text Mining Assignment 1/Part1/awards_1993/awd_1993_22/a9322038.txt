Abstract    :
                  This award provides funds to establish an REU Site in the Department of
              Microbiology  of the University of Iowa.  Emphasis will be placed on
              recruitment and selection of  women, minorities and students from non-Ph.D. -
              granting institutions where  opportunities for research are limited or
              nonexistent.  The nine students selected will be  integrated into participating
              faculty research teams and will be expected to perform in a  manner similar to
              beginning graduate students.  The hands-on experience in the  laboratory will
              be supplemented by informal discussions and weekly seminars.  A picnic,  a
              conference for student presentation of experimental results and a banquet at
              the end  of the session will also provide opportunity for social and scientific
              interaction.  It is  hoped that students will be stimulated to pursue careers
              in science through this REU  program.
