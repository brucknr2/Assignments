Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for  Undergraduate
              Site in Archaeology through Kenyon College.  The Site  is designed to provide
              eight highly motivated undergraduates with  the opportunity to develop their
              skills as archaeological field  scientists while working within the context of
              the Naco Valley  Archaeological Project, NW Honduras.  The project focuses on 
              student conduct of a significant independent investigation, from  enunciation
              of hypothesis to final write-up, supported by in-field  class instruction and a
              living and working situation between  students and research leaders on
              independent research projects.    This award contributes to the Foundation's
              continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in science
              through active  undergraduate research experiences.
