Abstract    :
              9322249  Pitts    The Center for Undergraduate Research in Virtual Systems
              Development at Trinity University provides a unique opportunity for outstanding
              young undergraduate scholars to participate in a research experience in the
              challenging and exciting area of Virtual Reality.  South Texas is a high
              percentage minority area and major effort is being waged to recruit minorities
              into the participant pool.  Five participants will be selected for the 1994
              summer research experience and, subsequently, ten participants will be selected
              for each of the following summers (1995 and 1996).    Seven Professors of the
              Computer Science Department provide the research mentorship for students in
              seven different state-of-the-art aspects of Virtual Reality.  Each student
              selects a research aspect area and mentor from research
              presentations/demonstrations during the first week of the Summer Research
              Experience.  After eight weeks of intensive research, each student should have
              an in-depth understanding of research methodology, simulated world development,
              3-D graphics, object oriented graphic design, intelligent systems and,
              consequently, Virtual Reality.    Most research will be conducted in the newly
              created Meadows Scientific Visualization Laboratory that contains twenty-two
              (22) H.P. 9000 networked high-end processors with enhanced graphics capability.
               Participants will be expected to submit their research experience to either
              the ACM Annual SIGSE Conference or the National Conference on Undergraduate
              Research.  ***
