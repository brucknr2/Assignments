Abstract    :
                    9322288  Hall           This award provides funds to the Undergraduate
              Neurosciences Program at Duke  University plans a summer research program for
              undergraduates who will have the opportunity  to become involved in
              neuroscience research at a major university Research and training  experiences
              will be organized around the theme of "Mechanisms of Behavior" The emphasis on 
              integrative, systems, and behavioral neuroscience that unifies faculty research
              interests within this  interdisciplinary field at Duke serves as the common
              theme for the individual projects available  to student participants in the
              program The focus of the ten week summer program for each  student will be a
              research mentorship with a participating faculty member Three weekly seminar 
              series -- "Research in the Neurosciences," "Science Basics," and "Science
              Ethics and Practice"  -- will be included in the summer schedule "Research in
              the Neurosciences" will focus on  ongoing faculty research so that students
              gain exposure to the field of neuroscience research  beyond their own mentor's
              specific interests "Science Basics" will address practical matters  pertaining
              to science careers"Science Ethics and Practice" will bring in outside speakers
              to  address ethics issues such as fraud and animal welfare, and will also
              involve panel discussion of  practical topics such as balancing career and
              family, life as a science graduate student, and  continuing research as an
              undergraduate The summer program will begin with a two day  Orientation
              Conference and will close with a Research Forum at which students present their
               results Applications to participate in "Mechanisms in Behavior" will be
              accepted from sophomore  undergraduates.  The Program is especially interested
              in receiving applications from  undergraduates at liberal arts colleges.  ***
