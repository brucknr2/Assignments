Abstract    :
              Funding for the REU site within the Physics Department at  Lehigh University
              will be continued.  The Department has a  strong internationally recognized
              research program which is  fully integrated with a strong commitment to
              undergraduate  education; hence the department is exceptionally well suited  to
              the demands of a successful undergraduate research  program.  Such a program
              has in fact existed in the  Department for the past 13 summers.  The Physics
              Department  was designated an REU site by the National Science  Foundation in
              1989 and from 1991-93.  Since 1989, we have  provided highly interactive
              research experiences for 100  physics majors representing 57 undergraduate
              institutions.  Generally, these are students who would not otherwise have  had
              the opportunity as undergraduates to participate in real  research.  This
              program includes research, weekly seminars  and lab tours, an end-of-the-summer
              symposium, and various  faculty/graduate student/undergraduate student social 
              functions.  An effective group housing arrangement,  subsidized heavily by the
              University, has greatly enhanced  both the academic and social experiences of
              the  participants.
