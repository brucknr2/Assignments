Abstract    :
              9322041  Strichartz       This award provides a research environment for a group
              of  eight undergraduate researchers in the mathematical sciences  working at
              Cornell University.  The project will engage the  students in an eight week
              program of experimentation, exploration  and computation leading them to
              consider serious mathematical  problems drawn from several areas.  These
              include harmonic  analysis related to wavelets and fractals, stability of
              periodic  circle packings, interactive particle system models of ecosystem 
              dynamics and superconvergence points in spline-Galerkin methods.  On problems
              related to nonlinear phenomena, as students will be  offered a number of
              open-ended problems and encouraged to attack  them numerically and
              analytically.  To assist the investigations,  students will be given
              instruction in the using computer  facilities. Additional students supported by
              REU supplements on  research grants will provide additional opportunities for
              healthy  interaction among the students.  Students will present the  results of
              their work orally as well asin written form.       Recruiting efforts will
              focus on attracting applications  from students in underrepresented groups,
              especially through  personal contacts.  ***
