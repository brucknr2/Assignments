Abstract    :
              9322635  Tanen  Description:  This proposal provides funds to  the Indo-US
              Subcommission on Education and  Culture to support the research  of U.S.
              scholars in India.  An initial  selection of candidates is made by the Council 
              for International Exchange of Scholars before  final review and selection by
              NSF.  Awardees  come from a wide range of scientific fields in  the social and
              physical sciences, and will work  with counterparts in India.  NSF supports the
               travel, a portion of living expenses, and some  costs related to the research
              project for  approximately eight awardees per academic year.   Part of the
              award funds the Subcommission for  administrative costs.  Past participants
              have  engaged primarily in the social and behavioral  sciences, with some in
              the physical  and  geological sciences.      Scope:  This project directly
              supports  collaborative research between US and Indian  scholars.  The office
              that represents the  Subcommission in India provides critical  services for the
              U.S. side such as obtaining  necessary clearances for US scientists to be 
              affiliated with various Indian academic and  research institutions.  They
              manage the  logistics of travel for each scientist and  his/her family as
              necessary; arrange for the  shipping of research material into and out of 
              India; provide for language training and assist  with research arrangements. 
              This project fits  the objectives of the India program very well.   ***
