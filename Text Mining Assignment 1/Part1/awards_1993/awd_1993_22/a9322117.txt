Abstract    :
              9322117  Scotti    Dr. Scotti will obtain and reduce charge-coupled-device (CCD)
               observations of the unusual cometary object P/Shoemaker-Levy 9  which is
              predicted to impact on the planet Jupiter in July 1994.   The objective is to
              obtain accurate astrometry of the brightest of  the individual nuclei of this
              comet so that improved predictions  for the actual impact times may be made in
              advance of the event.   The image data will also be useful in characterizing
              both the  morphology of the comet and the large scale structures associated 
              with the comet.
