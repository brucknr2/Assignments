Abstract    :
              9322607  Nowak      The objective of the program is to review the current
              methods and  technology  in bridge evaluation, repair and rehabilitation  used 
              in  Poland,  Czech  Republic, Slovak Republic and  Hungary.   The  major  areas
               include:   (1)  analytical  evaluation  of  bridges  (loads,   system 
              identification  methods,  damage   accumulation  models,  time  history 
              models), (2)  bridge  management  systems  (optimization  models, decision
              making strategy,  BMS  data  set,  bridge  expert  systems,  strategic  long 
              range  planning,   (3)  diagnostic procedures (bridge tests, weigh-9n-motion,
              performance  monitors,    nondestructive   techniques,   signal    processing, 
              integrated  sensor  systems,  microwave,  acoustic  and   optical  techniques),
               (4)  materials  and  techniques  for   repair   and  rehabilitation  of 
              bridges  (steel, reinforced  and  prestressed  concrete,  masonry  arches,
              timber, new materials).   Accordingly  the  Bridge  Study tour will attempt to
              review state of  the  art  summary of main topics as reviewed on one hand in
              the U.  S.  and,  on  the  other hand, in Poland, Czech Republic,  Slovak 
              Republic  and Hungary, identify the research needs, in particular  topics  for
              cooperative projects; and derive some recommendations  that  reflect  the  need
               in manpower,  technology  transfer  and  education  for the near future.  The
              Study Tour will involve  the  US  group  of bridge researchers, consultants and
              representatives  of  bridge  authorities, visiting Poland, Czech Republic, 
              Slovak  Republic and Hungary.  the local organizers will organize special 
              conferences, meetings and field trips to the construction  sites.  The results
              will be presented in the report.  ***
