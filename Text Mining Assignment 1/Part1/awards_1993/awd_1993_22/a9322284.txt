Abstract    :
                  9322284  WHITLEDGE    This project is to develop a REU program, specifically
              targeted  towards the participation of minority and women undergraduate 
              students.  Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting students  from the
              HMCU's from the South Texas region.  There is a wide  range of projects with
              research opportunities and there is a good  plan to integrate students with the
              general student population at  UTMSI by the assignment of a graduate student
              mentor.
