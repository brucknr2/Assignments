Abstract    :
              9322083  Vanasupa  Recent technological developments in microelectronic
              processing demonstrate that electrolessly deposited copper(Cu) is a viable
              replacement for aluminum (A1) alloys as an interconnect material for large
              scale and ultra-large scale integrated circuits.  Most of the studies
              concerning this material have focused on the resulting electrical properties of
              electrolessly deposited Cu films.  This project uses atomic force microscopy to
              study the physical deposition mechanisms (nucleation and growth) of the films
              in situ.  Scanning tunneling microscopy and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction
              will provide additional crystallographic information.  The electrical
              performance of the films will also be evaluated.  Through this study we will
              gain insight into the relationship between the deposition conditions and the
              resulting microstructure and properties.  A greater understanding of the
              physical deposition mechanism of the electrolessly deposited Cu will allow
              better control of the deposition process and the film properties.  ***
