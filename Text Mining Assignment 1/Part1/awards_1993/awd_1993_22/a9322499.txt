Abstract    :
              29322499  Hearn  This Americas Program award will support a research 
              collaboration between Dr. Thomas Hearn of New Mexico  State University, Las
              Cruces and Dr. Marianne  Mareschal, Ecole Polytechnique, Montreal, Quebec, 
              Canada.  They propose to deploy a passive-source  seismic array along the
              Lithoprobe Abitibi-Grenville  Geologic Transect to complement seismic
              reflection  profiles and magnetotelluric data.  A primary goal of  this study
              is to test the hypothesis that both mantle  seismic anisotropy and mantle
              structure in the region  are related to Proterozoic and Archean orogenic 
              episodes.  The site is a logical place to test such  hypothesis, both because
              the available Lithoprobe data  and because the transect lies over a portion of
              the  Canadian shield that experienced major Proterozoic and  Archean
              deformation.      This project combines the expertise of Lithoprobe,  Canada's
              national, earth science research project,  with the unique capabilities
              provided by the U.S.  Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology 
              (IRIS).  While the Lithoprobe project has focused on  investigating the crust
              using exploration techniques,  IRIS will provide its PASCAL portable seismic
              array,  which is more suited for investigating upper mantle  structure.  The
              Canadian group will focus on the  analysis of travel time data, while the U.S.
              group  will work primarily with the analysis of shear-wave  data.  ***
