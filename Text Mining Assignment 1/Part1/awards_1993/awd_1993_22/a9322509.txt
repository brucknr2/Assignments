Abstract    :
              9322509  Mac Low      The fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 will strike
              Jupiter in July 1994.  Semi-analytic methods and full hydrodynamics codes will
              be will be utilized to model Jupiter's atmosphere during the first 200 seconds
              after the impact of a fragment.  These models provide initial conditions for
              the airburst. The key point is that the energy released by these impacts is
              large enough that the explosion breaks out of the atmosphere.  the focus will
              be on developing detailed numerical simulations of the airburst and the
              fireball.  The primary goal will be to produce light curves, as might be
              observable from the Galileo and Voyager 2 spacecraft, or as reflected off
              well-placed Jovian satellites.  Other goals are to predict the amount and
              velocity of material thrown out of the atmosphere (and where it might be
              expected to re-enter the atmosphere), the amount of mass raised to high
              altitudes where unusual clouds might form, and the energy deposited at various
              depths in the atmosphere.           M  #PD  9322509  Mac Low      The fragments
