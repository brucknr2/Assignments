Abstract    :
              9322801  King   This activity will partially support a summer undergraduate
              research group at NIST/Gaithersburg.  To strengthen undergraduate AMO physics
              curricula, the program director will work with department chairs and directors
              of centers of excellence to identify two undergraduates from each institution
              who are prepared for, and would benefit from off-campus summer research in AMO
              physics.  The selected 20 students will spend 12 weeks actively engaged,
              one-on-one with NIST staff physicists in projects combining quests for
              fundamental knowledge with direct applications to problems of national
              importance.  Seeing how they can make a difference and learning about
              non-academic alternatives for research careers are side benefits.  Student and
              advisor will be paired based on background and interests, to facilitate
              dialogue between the student, the student's physics professors and NIST advisor
              about the intended project - ensuring the student arrives at NIST ready to
              contribute, and preparing the student's professors for follow-up in the fall. 
              The students will collectively live in a nearby furnished apartment complex and
              participate in the many NIST seminars and in a weekly SURFing the Physics Lab
              Summer Seminar Series.  The students will all present their research in a
              seminar at NIST and be encouraged to participate in a scientific conference
              during the following year.  Costs for this program will be shared by NIST, NSF
              and the participating schools.  Given the significant lack of diversity in the
              present physics work force, this partnership will aggressively seek out
              competitive students from underrepresented group s and with disabilities.  ***
