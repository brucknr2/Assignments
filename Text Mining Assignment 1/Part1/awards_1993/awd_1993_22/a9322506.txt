Abstract    :
              9322506  Gladstone         The proposed work involves investigating the chemical
              response  of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere of Jupiter in the aftermath 
              of the impact of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9.  Specifically, after 
              characterizing the chemistry of the comet prior to the collision,  a
              time-dependent study will be conducted as to the effect on the  abundances of
              observable hydrocarbons of an injection of cometary  material into the jovian
              upper atmosphere.  Investigators will also  study the effect of injecting into
              the upper atmosphere substantial  amounts of usually tropospheric species, such
              as ammonia, that  might be entrained in a deep impact fireball.  Finally, the
              changes  in ionospheric composition in response to the event will be 
              separately examined.  ***
