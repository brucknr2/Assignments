Abstract    :
                    9322148  Webber          This award provides funds to continue a
              successful REU Site at Arizona State  University in the Center for the Study of
              Early Events In Photosynthesis.  Life on this  planet is ultimately dependent
              on photosynthesis for its energy requirements.  At Arizona  State University,
              the center, comprised of faculty in the departments of Botany and  Chemistry
              and Biochemistry, takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the 
              energy storage process carried out by photosynthetic organisms and mimicking 
              photosynthesis using artificial systems.  Undergraduate students will
              participate in the  individual research programs of the Center faculty. 
              Projects will include organic  synthesis and spectroscopic studies of model
              compounds, spectroscopic studies of  bacterial and plant photosynthetic
              reaction centers, and molecular biology and genetics  of photosynthetic
              systems.  Structured interaction between faculty and student  participants,
              including the weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research group meetings, 
              instrumentation workshops and a concluding undergraduate symposium, will help
              educate  the students in the extremely diverse modern approach to the study of
              photosynthesis.   Student participants will be recruited from targeted colleges
              and universities in the  Southwest United States with the help of local
              departments chairs and individual faculty.  ***
