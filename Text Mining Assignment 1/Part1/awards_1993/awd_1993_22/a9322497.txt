Abstract    :
              9322497  POMERANZ  This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences
              for  Undergraduates Site in Psychology at SUNY at Stony Brook.  The  program
              will immerse 10 undergraduate students in an active  research environment
              spanning the areas of behavioral and cognitive  neuroscience, psychophysiology
              and the experimental study of  decision, choice and self-control.  The goal is
              to introduce  students who are not currently involved in a laboratory research 
              program to state-of-the art psychological research in some of the  most
              interesting areas of experimental psychology.  Recruitment of  students will
              focus on schools with large minority populations and  institutions which do not
              have the resources to provide their  students with research experiences. 
              Students will conduct  independent research projects in one of eleven active
              research  laboratories.  To supplement the laboratory experience, a variety  of
              group activities such as visits to other labs, laboratory  meetings, seminars,
              and symposia are planned.    This award contributes to the Foundation's
              continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in science
              through active  undergraduate research experiences.  ***
