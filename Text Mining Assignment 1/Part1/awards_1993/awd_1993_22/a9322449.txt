Abstract    :
              9322449  Millis    This project is one of four in a coordinated campaign that
              involves  investigators from the University of Arizona, Lowell Observatory, 
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and NASA Ames Research Center.   The
              groups will deploy portable, high-speed CCD systems to four sites  spaced in
              longitude around the globe for the purpose of recording an  epochal series of
              collisions of various subnuclei of Comet Shoemaker-  Levy 9 with the planet
              Jupiter.  The objectives of the observations are to  obtain images of all faces
              of Jupiter in several passbands immediately  prior to the encounters, to record
              the flashes produced by the incoming  bolides as seen in light reflected off
              the Galilean satellites, to document  the changes produced in the planet's
              appearance as a result of the  impacts, and to record the evolution of affected
              belts and zones as the  planet settles back to equilibrium.
