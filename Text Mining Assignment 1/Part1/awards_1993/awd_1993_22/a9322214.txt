Abstract    :
              9322214  Mittler  An REU Site will be established in the Physics Department of
              the  University of Massachusetts, Lowell.  Undergraduate students will  be
              given a rich experience in physics research that will provide  sufficient means
              for them to seriously consider a research career  in science.  The students
              will carry out their own research in  the setting of a research group composed
              of other undergraduate  students, graduate students, and faculty.  This will
              foster both  student-student and student-faculty interaction.  Each student 
              will have a faculty mentor.  The students will be fully  integrated into the
              research groups and thus contribute  significantly to the research effort. 
              Another aim of the program  is to attract those students who would not normally
              have a chance  to do research and women, minority members, and the disabled, 
              groups who are typically underrepresented in physics.  A  supplementary ethics
              program will sensitize the students to the  ethics involved in scientific
              research.  Students will be housed  on campus and be offered a number of
              cultural, community, and  recreational activities.  ***
