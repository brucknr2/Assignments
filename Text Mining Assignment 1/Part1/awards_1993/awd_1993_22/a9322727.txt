Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Friesen  9322727     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase
              II project will develop novel copolymers with an improved combination of high
              permeability and high selectivity for use in making membranes for gas and vapor
              separations. Typically, membranes with high permeabilities have low
              selectivities, and vice versa. During Phase I, the feasibility of preparing
              copolymers with an improved combination of permeability and selectivity was
              successfully demonstrated. The novel substituted polyacetylene copolymers
              developed in Phase I displayed the physical characteristics necessary for
              making membranes and were prepared in high (>70%) yield. During Phase II,
              research will focus on continuing to develop and evaluate copolymers based on
              monomers use in Phase I; synthesizing and evaluating copolymers made from
              additional monomers; evaluating the copolymers for industrially important
              separations; developing procedures for making asymmetric hollow-fiber membranes
              from the copolymers; and making and testing small hollow-fiber modules.   The
              widespread use of membrane systems for many separations has been limited by the
              performance of current membranes. Potential commercial applications for
              high-permeability, high-selectivity membranes include the production of
              nitrogen from air; the production of oxygen for medical applications; the
              removal of carbon dioxide from natural gas; the recovery of hydrogen from
              petroleum-refining process streams; and the separation of volatile organic
              vapors (e.g., propane/propylene).      Keywords:    membrane, gas separation,
              polymer, high permeability, high selectivity
