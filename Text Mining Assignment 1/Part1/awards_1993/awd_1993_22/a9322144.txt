Abstract    :
                  9322144  Johnson    This award provides funds to the Department of Molecular
              Genetics at Ohio State  University to establish a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates Site.  Participants will  be recruited from high quality
              undergraduate institutions where research opportunities  are limited.  The
              students will undertake an intense 10-week  summer research program that
              introduces them to a research problem, trains them in the  experimental
              approaches that are used to attack the problem, stimulates them to develop 
              independence, and enhances their ability to communicate scientific information
              to others.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the students' independent
              planning of experiments,  interpretation of experimental data, and presentation
              of their observations to other  students and faculty.  The projects in which
              the REU students will participate reflect the  diversity of research interests
              of the faculty as well as the common foundation of  molecular genetics.  This
              common foundation will enable the REU students to  appreciate the power of
              modern molecular genetic approaches to solve a wide variety of  problems in the
              biological sciences.  The REU students will work closely with the faculty 
              mentor and with the graduate students, postdocs and technicians in their
              laboratories.  They will participate in the weekly meetings of each research
              group as well as the weekly  REU seminar series.  This will enable all of the
              REU students to meet on a regular  basis, to compare their experiences, and to
              broaden their horizons regarding important  research problems.  At the end of
              the summer, the students will write a summary of their  experimental results
              and present their results to the faculty and REU participants.  ***
