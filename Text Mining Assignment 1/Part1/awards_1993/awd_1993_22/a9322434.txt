Abstract    :
                  The award will support the development, testing and evaluation of algorithms
              to  enable the functional and structural mapping of the brain between different
              modalities,  subjects and developmental stages.  The algorithms will  
              spatially deform data from  varied sources so that they become comparable.  The
              algorithms will be applied to  positioning, warping, interpolating and
              parameterizing of 3D brain data.  The PI will  model brain using volume and
              surface based approaches, then transform it using  methods ranging from rigid
              repositioning to nonlinear, local deformations.   Transformation algorithms
              will first be measured for accuracy, reliability and validity  via experiments
              using simulations and previously acquired data.  The goal is to  develop
              algorithms that are biologically valid as well as numerically accurate.  This 
              work will complement the Human Brain Project research and will enable the 
              integration of independent yet complementary brain information from different
              sources  and projects.
