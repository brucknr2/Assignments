Abstract    :
              9322466  NASH  This award provides funds for a Research Experience for 
              Undergraduates Site project to involve students in the ongoing  study of
              contemporary socio-cultural change among the highland  Mayan and Mexican
              national (ladino or mestizo) communities of  Chiapas, southeastern Mexico.  The
              project director is a seasoned  investigator with career-long experience of
              research in this  area.  Eight students will be selected from among applicants
              in  the undergraduate colleges of the City University of New York and  the
              State University of New York.  Students will be trained in  the methods of
              anthropological field research.  They will be  involved in development projects
              such as artisan cooperatives,  reforestation, cash crop production, tourism,
              bilingual  education, midwifery, and other initiatives that the Mexican 
              government is now promoting.  In addition to the field research,  students will
              attend a week of orientation classes, weekly  seminars by the project director
              on field techniques, and weekly  meetings with field workers who are carrying
              out research in the  region.  At the end of the summer, students will be
              expected to  share research findings with colleagues through publication and 
              translation.    This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts
              to  attract talented students into careers in science through active 
              undergraduate research experiences.  ***
