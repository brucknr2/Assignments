Abstract    :
                     9322751  Stross        This project supports the dissertation research of
              a  linguistic anthropologist from the University of Texas, studying  the
              rhetorical functions of parallel speech styles among native  speakers of the
              Sierra Popoluca language of rural Veracruz,  Mexico.  Parallelism (defined as
              repetition with systematic  variation of grammatical, semantic or prosodic
              structures of an  utterance) in Native American verbal performance has been
              shown  to enhance meaning in traditional narratives.  This research will  look
              at relationships in a variety of speech genres from  conversation to ritual
              speech to provide a comparative data base  of parallelism in discourse
              performance.         The student will record, transcribe and translate
              naturally  occurring speech events in a variety of contexts.  This research  is
              important because it will add to our understanding of the role  of parallelism
              in American Indian languages, will help train a  junior linguistic scientist,
              and will document and conserve  native American linguistic culture.  ***
