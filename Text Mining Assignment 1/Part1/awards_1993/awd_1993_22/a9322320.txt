Abstract    :
              9322320  Campbell       We will establish an NSF-sponsored "Research Experiences
              for  Undergraduates" (REU) sites in "Nonlinear Science" at the  University of
              Illinois Urbana-Champaign under the joint auspices  of the Department of
              Physics and the Center for Complex Systems  Research.  In each of its three
              years the program will provide  research experiences for eight carefully
              selected undergraduates  in one of four broad "paradigm" areas of nonlinear
              science:  deterministic chaos, solitons/coherent structures, pattern  formation
              and selection, and adaptation and learning.  The  research will include
              analytic, computational, and experimental  examples.  ***
