Abstract    :
              9322410  Cummings       The Owyhee region of eastern Oregon is proposed as a REU
              Site.  The Site affords students an opportunity to conduct geologic  mapping at
              a scale of 1:24,000, topic-specific field  investigations, and to participate
              in geophysical studies in  volcanic, volcaniclastics, and hydrothermally
              altered rocks.  The  field program is integrated with a laboratory program
              where  students use samples or data collected in their own research areas.  The
              objective of the program is to integrate field, laboratory, and  professional
              presentation of research results.  Students are  encouraged to present research
              results at regional or local  professional meetings.
