Abstract    :
              9322546  Aagaard    Research conducted by this award is a component of the 1994 
              U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section (AOS).  The AOS is a  collaborative effort
              with Canada that involves approximately  60 scientists participating on a
              Canadian and a U.S.  icebreaker during a 55-day field program in the summer of 
              1994.  The AOS is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems  Science (ARCSS)
              Global Change Research Program and research  is jointly sponsored by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences, the  Office of Polar Programs and Office of Naval
              Research (ONR).  Data collected should be relevant to improving our under- 
              standing of how the Arctic is an indicator of changing  global climate
              conditions and how it affects the physical,  chemical, and biological features
              of the more temperate  oceans and regions.    This specific research project
              encompasses part of the  hydrography program.  Precision temperature,
              conductivity,  oxygen, and nutrient profiles will be collected at intervals 
              along the cruise track.  Resulting data will be analyzed to  increase
              understanding of the structure and circulation of  the Arctic Ocean.  Research
              will focus on three areas: 1)  the structure of the halocine, wherein density
              differences  between masses of seawater may drive the circulation and  mixing
              of deep Arctic Ocean water with water from other  parts of the world's oceans;
              2) seawater properties and  gradients near major seafloor features, and 3) the 
              horizontal and vertical structure of the water column below  1500 meters.  ***
