              Abstract  ATM-9322769  Bradley, Raymond S.  University of Massachusetts  Title:
              Laminated Lake Sediments from the Canadian High Arctic:  Understanding the
              Climatic Signal for Paleoclimatic Reconstruction    Synopsis.  Ice core and
              other paleoclimatic records from the High  Arctic suggest that summer
              temperatures reached minimum levels for  the entire Holocene during the last
              500 years, but underwent a  dramatic reversal in the last 100 years.  This
              award, under the  Paleoclimate from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE) program
              is  designed to study lake sediments from a number of sites to  determine if
              this hypothesis is supported by the sedimentary  record.    To better
              understand the paleoclimatic signal in the sediments, a  three year
              process-based study is planned to determine the primary  controls on sediments
              flux and varved sediment formation in Sophia  Lake, a High Arctic hypersaline,
              meromictic lake.  Sophia Lake  provides a simple topographic environment, which
              will facilitate  efforts to isolate the primary climatic forcing.  Sediments
              from  lakes on the margin of Agassiz Ice Cap will also be recovered in  order
              to link the paleoclimatic record of ice cores from the ice  cap to sedimentary
              records from the glacier margin,
