Abstract    :
                This project continues research efforts on the morphology and dynamics of the
              Earth's  magnetosphere.  The methodology emphasizes particle precipitation data
              and auroral  imagery from low altitude satellites.  Ionospheric convection as
              determined from HF  radars as well as middle-magnetosphere satellite data will
              also play crucial roles in the  program.  Research will be conducted in four
              broad categories.  The first category  concerns the low-altitude signatures of
              magnetopause processes in which we will  clarify the distinctions between
              various high altitude magnetospheric plasma regimes.   The second category
              addresses dayside auroral phenomenology using coordinated  satellite imagery
              and particle precipitation data, particularly from the DMSP satellites.   The
              third category involves coordinated observations using the extensive DMSP 
              satellite data and ground-based coherent radar data to investigate the dynamics
              of  substorm behavior.  Finally, the fourth category involves magnetic
              field-aligned  processes that connect the low altitude regions to the middle
              magnetosphere.
