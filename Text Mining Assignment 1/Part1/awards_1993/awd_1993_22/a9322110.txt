Abstract    :
                  9322110  Wells                        This award provides funds to support
              undergraduates involved in research projects  in molecular biosciences.  Ten
              University of Arizona (UA) undergraduates who are part  of the Undergraduate
              Biology Research Program (UBRP), a larger program for  undergraduates
              conducting biological research in UA faculty laboratories, will receive 
              support.  Students apply to the program and once selected by a faculty/student 
              committee, can choose to work with any of 185 faculty sponsors, 65 of whom
              conduct  research in molecular biosciences.  Students interview faculty
              sponsors to determine  where they will work.  This insures that students work
              on a problem that is of interest to  them and fosters a productive working
              relationship with the faculty sponsor and lab  group.  In addition to the
              students' research experience, lab meetings and seminars, the  program provides
              an orientation that includes radiation and laboratory safety, animal  care and
              use training, and information on careers, job search strategies and how to get 
              into graduate school.  A bimonthly seminar promotes discussion of biomedical,
              research  and environmental ethics.  The annual UBRP Conference enables
              students to present  their experimental results and those who have their work
              accepted for presentation at  scientific conferences receive funds to attend.  
                      Five Native American students per year from other institutions,
              particularly at  community colleges, will be involved in summer research. 
              Relationships with faculty at  other institutions will help recruit students
              who would not be able to participate in  research on their home campuses.  They
              will become familiar with UA, where they could  transfer to complete bachelor's
              degrees.  ***
