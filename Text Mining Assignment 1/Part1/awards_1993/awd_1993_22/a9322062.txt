Abstract    :
              9322062  Tezduyar  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will
              involve  students in high-performance computing in fluid dynamics.  Examples 
              of particular tasks are:       a)   understanding the significance and
              practical value of the            application problem,       b)   proper
              mathematical modeling of the problem, including            the specification of
              the differential equations to be            solved and the associated boundary
              conditions,       c)   being aware of the challenges involved in numerical     
                    solution of these equations,       d)   selecting the computational
              method best suitable for the            problem,       e)   generating the
              mesh, grid, or other discretization            environment for the selected
              computational method,       f)   selecting the computational hardware best
              suitable for            the computations planned,       g)   setting the stage
              for vectorized computations on the most            advanced Crays or
              implementing the formulations for            massively parallel computations on
              the Connection            Machines CM-200 and CM-5,       h)   performing the
              actual computations, and       i)   visualizing and analyzing the computed data
              with the            advanced graphics techniques, including the video          
               animation of the computed results.  ***
