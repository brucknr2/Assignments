Abstract    :
              9322611  WOLCOTT       Progress in geomorphology rests squarely on the ability
              to  obtain good field data. However, designing and carrying out field  sampling
              strategies can be a complicated process involving  interactions between a host
              of variables. No standard textbooks  are able to provide the insight necessary
              to conduct complex data  gathering in geomorphology. This project provides
              modest support  to enable 12 doctoral students to participate in a workshop 
              devoted to better understanding the process of high quality data  collection.
              The students will be joined by a number of experts in  field sampling who will
              present papers, lead discussions, and  consult in small groups.       This
              project will have a major impact on the development of  young scientists in
              geomorphology by providing them with advanced  training in the use of field
              sampling techniques. The workshop  will provide direct assistance to the
              conduct of their  dissertation research and will have a long-lasting impact on
              the  quality of their future research  ***
