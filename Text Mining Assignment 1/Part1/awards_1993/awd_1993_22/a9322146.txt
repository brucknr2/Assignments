Abstract    :
              9322146  Strauss       Stability and instability phenomena will be  investigated
              in the kinetic theory of charged particles both  with and without collisions.
              Also to be studied are harmonic  maps in Minkowski space, and the stability
              theory of time-  dependent ground states of scalar fields, including the 
              effects of boundaries. A further focus of research is the  smoothing phenomenon
              for linear and nonlinear dispersive  waves.Advanced semiconductor devices, used
              for computer  chips, are made of materials whose properties derive from  the
              movements of negative electrons and positive "holes".  Such movements form a
              type of nonlinear wave and are  described by certain mathematical equations. We
              study how  these movements change and how they are sensitive to initial 
              variations. The same kinds of equations describe many other  wave phenomena in
              science and engineering, such as in energy  research and space research. The
              sensitivity of nonlinear  waves is studied in a variety of contexts. The
              purpose is to  determine the fundamental reasons for the unstable behavior  of
              waves.Walter Strauss
