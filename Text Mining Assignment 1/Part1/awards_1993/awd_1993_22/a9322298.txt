Abstract    :
              9322298  Sokolsky  Construction will start on a new instrument, the High
              Resolution  Fly's Eye (HiRes), to detect cosmic-rays at the very highest 
              energies yet observed or expected to be observed on earth and  determine their
              spectrum, angular distribution and composition.  It uses the unique
              air-florescence technique that has been  demonstrated to be very successful in
              earlier versions of the  Fly's Eye devices.  The detector will be constructed
              at the U.S.  Army Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, the site of the earlier 
              Fly's Eye apparatus  and a HiRes prototype.  The University of  Utah group, in
              collaboration with physicists from Columbia  University, the University of
              Illinois, and the University of  Adelaide, Australia, will construct in a 5
              year period first  stage arrays of 28 mirrors and associated focal-plane
              phototubes  and electronics at each of two sites separated by 13 km.  They 
              contemplate a full system of 54 mirrors per site to be completed  at some as
              yet unspecified later time.  ***
