Abstract    :
              9322217  STERN  This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for
               Undergraduates Site in Experimental Psychology at Pennsylvania  State
              University.  Eight undergraduate students will be selected to  work as
              apprentices with faculty members who are nationally known  for their research
              and highly experienced at preparing  undergraduates for graduate school. 
              Students will work full-time  for eight weeks in the summer in various subareas
              of experimental  psychology, including psychophysiology, emotions, perception, 
              cognitive, and physiological psychology.  They will design an  independent
              research project during the latter part of the summer  and complete it with the
              help of their Penn State mentor and "home"  school memtor during the following
              academic year.  At the end of  the spring semester, they will present their
              research results at a  Penn State department colloquium.  Every effort will be
              made to  encourage and assist students to gain admission to graduate school.   
              This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract
              talented students into careers in science through active  undergraduate
              research experiences.  ***
