Abstract    :
              9322673  Walschap       The scope of research covers the differential geometry
              of  metric and totally geodesic foliations on Riemannian manifolds  with focus
              on curvature questions. The latter involve techniques  from ergodic theory and
              topology to analyze growth conditions.  This research has potential
              applications to mathematical physics.  ***
