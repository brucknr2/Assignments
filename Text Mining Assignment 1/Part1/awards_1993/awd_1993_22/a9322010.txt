Abstract    :
              9322010   Cordes  The University of Alabama Computer Science Undergraduate
              Research Program brings together nine students from small schools throughout
              the South. They participate in ongoing research projects with the faculty
              members in the Computer Science Department (and closely related disciplines) at
              The University of Alabama. The program is ten weeks in duration, spanning the
              same time frame as the summer term at The University of Alabama.    
              Individuals from small, primarily undergraduate schools in the South are the
              major focus of this program. Emphasis is placed on the recruitment of female
              and minority students. The program actively recruits students from Colleges and
              Universities across the South. Students from institutions that lack a graduate
              program in Computer Science, as well as predominately minority institutions,
              are the major focus of the recruiting efforts. The program at the University of
              Alabama targets students who have completed three years of studies and have an
              interest in participating in current research efforts underway in the
              Department.   u    raduate Research Program brings together nine students from
