Abstract    :
              9322669  Popek  This project will develop and prototype concepts and techniques 
              needed to support network access to users even after periodic  disconnection of
              user workstations from the network.  More  specifically, the project will
              develop a prototype based on the  idea of pre-loading the workstations (and
              portable computers)  with files that are most likely to be accessed during 
              disconnected mode.  In addition, the project will develop  software support
              tools to resynchronize files on the portable  computers with file serves upon
              reconnect.  Disconnection must be  treated as a normal, desirable mode of
              operation, rather than as  an error condition.  Even after days of
              disconnection from the  network, the disconnected machine should be able to
              operate and  deliver most of the functionality associated with the network 
              environment, including access to shared network files and other  resources. 
              Providing this capability around the clock,  regardless of the geographic
              location will make a significant  impact on the future of computing
              environments and collaborative  work environments.  ***
