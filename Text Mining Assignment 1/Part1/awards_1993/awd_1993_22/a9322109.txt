Abstract    :
              9322109   Hogg            Texas A & M  Dr. John L. Hogg and other members of the
              Chemistry Department of Texas A & M are being  supported to continue a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) site in Chemistry. For  the period 1994-6,
              ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer  actively engaged
              in a variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of 
              chemistry -analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. There
              will be a strong  focus on women, minorities and handicapped drawn nationally
              from smaller schools that lack  major research programs.
