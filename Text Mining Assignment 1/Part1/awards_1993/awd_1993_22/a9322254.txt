Abstract    :
              9322254  Kuehl    The project will analyze data collected during a cruise off 
              Bangladesh.  Seismic reflection data and sediment cores will be  analyzed to
              determine the fate of the massive load of sediments  transported by the
              Ganges/Bramaputra/Meghna river complex.  The  author poses 10 hypotheses
              concerning sediment transport and  deposition, based on preliminary data, and
              requests support for  geochemical analyses to date the sediments, and for
              further  processing and analysis of the seismic data.
