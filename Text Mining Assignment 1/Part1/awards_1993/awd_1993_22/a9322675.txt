Abstract    :
              9322675  Jones       Jones will conduct research over broad areas in analysis,  
              algebra, topology and mathematical physics, ranging from work in   group
              cohomology inspired by an invariant due to Connes on von   Neumann algebras to
              the statistics of fields in low   dimensional(conformal and otherwise) field
              theory. The   topological implications are in knot theory and 3-manifold  
              topology. The unifying theme is that of a subfactor which is   ultimately
              related to all these topics. Endomorphisms onto   subfactors are also playing
              an increasing role.       The general area of the mathematics in this project
              has its  basis in the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. In 
              quantum mechanics one deals with non-commutative objects that can  be analyzed
              by considering their algebraic structure as a   mathematical construct called a
              von Neumann algebra. These   abstract objects have a surprising variety of
              applications. In   this project, invariants associated with these algebras will
              be   investigated with an eye towards applications in knot theory and   quantum
              statistics.  ***
