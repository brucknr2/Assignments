Abstract    :
              9322390  Schwartz    This  research is concerned with the study of key areas of
              mercury  barium copper oxide superconductor related chemistry.  Alternative 
              routes are developed for mercury barium copper oxide superconductor  synthesis
              with an emphasis on approaches that are relevant for bulk  processing in
              particular, the proposed approach emulates partial-  melt processing while
              avoiding the hazards and difficulties  associated with hot liquid mercury.  The
              results obtained will  indicate future directions in mercury barium copper
              oxide  superconductor processing and will form the basis for a subsequent 
              peer-reviewed proposal to the NSF under the Advanced Materials  Process
              Program.  ***
