Abstract    :
              9322601  Mead    Description:  This project supports a planning  visit by two
              U.S. scientists to Bangladesh to  refine a collaborative research program, 
              involving scientists from Europe, Bangladesh  and the United States.  The
              objective is to  study the sedimentation and subsidence in the  delta plain
              formed by the Ganges-Brahmaputra-  Meghna rivers on modern (100 years) time
              scale,  and since the glaciation (Holocene).  This vast  floodplain may be the
              sink for 40-80% of the  sediment discharged from this river system,  which is
              the world's largest.  An understanding  of the overall sediment budget for this
              system  has local as well as global relevance.   Quantifying and mapping
              sedimentation and  subsidence patterns is a prerequisite to  implementing flood
              control engineering in  Bangladesh where 35-40% of the country is  flooded
              annually.      Scope:  Extensive scientific and logistic  planning is required
              to integrate this study  with an existing joint Bangladesh-European  study of
              river hydrodynamics and morphology.   The visit will allow that coordination
              through  meetings with Bangladesh scientists and  government officials, and
              through field  examination of potential sampling sites.    ***
