Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed Phase II research is to adapt a variety of high
              accurate, computationally expensive ab initio methods to run efficiently in
              parallel on a network of workstations.  This will extend the capacity and
              availability of electronic structure theory methods to researchers, by
              multiplying the computing resources applied to the problem.  Feasibility was
              established by Phase I research that parallelized Hartree-Fock SCF in Gaussian
              92 through the use of the Linda parallel programming model and software,
              resulting in good speedups on networks of 4-6 workstations.    Working with the
              Gaussian and Linda software, the principal objective is to parallelize (to the
              same level as in Phase I) the computation of MP2, MP3, CID, CISD, MP4, CCD, BD,
              QCISD, and CCSD energies, including non-interative triple excitation
              corrections, and gradients up to QCISD.  In the process we plan to develop
              associated strategies for ERI transformations and iterative energy and gradient
              methods, to minimize data movement and redundant computations.  A second Phase
              II objective is to enhance the parallel performance of SCF functions on larger
              numbers of workstations.  Candidates for parallelization include ERI (shell
              quartet) selection, matrix diagonalization and other matrix operations used in
              the ERI transformation and back-transformation.
