Abstract    :
              9322220  Netzly  This award provides an additional five years of continuing
              support to the Department  of Biology at Hope College to carry on with the
              Research Experience for  Undergraduates Site that was established in 1987. Each
              summer, under the direction of  eleven Ph.D. faculty, the program will provide
              ten undergraduate students with an in-  depth summer experience focusing on
              environmental biology.  Objectives of the  program are to: 1) continue the
              active recruitment of under-represented groups into  the program, 2) provide an
              effective, learning community of junior and senior  researchers focusing on
              environmental biology at the community, organismal, and  cellular levels; and
              3) train undergraduate students to become proficient in learning,  doing and
              communicating their research.  This research program will have an impact  on
              the student participants' understanding of science; impact the sciences as the 
              students present and publish their results to the scientific community; and
              have an  impact beyond the sciences: students will have a working knowledge of
              science and   will impact society whatever their eventual occupational choice.
