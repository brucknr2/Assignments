Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Richard N. Zare will obtain quantum-state specific  
              information on the dynamics of elementary gas-phase chemical reactions   using
              molecular beam and laser spectroscopic methods.  The planned   experiments will
              provide the complete three-dimensional velocity   distribution of the reaction
              products as well as the state-to-state   differential reaction cross sections. 
              Reagents will be prepared in   individual rovibronic states using tunable
              infrared radiation or   stimulated Raman pumping.  Molecular and atomic
              products will be detected   in specific quantum states, enabling the
              observations to be compared with   calculations.   %%%  In order to obtain
              detailed information on chemical reactions, the   experiments in this project
              will use molecular beam techniques as a means   of isolating molecules and
              investigating reactive encounters one   collision at a time.  Laser techniques,
              on the other hand, permit the   reacting species to be prepared with very
              specific amounts of energy and   spatial orientation, and they also allow the
              products to be interrogated   for their energy content and orientation.  Such
              data enable chemists to   understand how reactions occur by relating the
              experimental observations   with precise calculations which describe the forces
              experienced by   reagents and products during a chemical transformation.  The
              interplay   between theory and experiment will eventually allow chemists to
              predict   the products of any chemical reaction as well as to understand how to
                cause a reaction to be more efficient or yield different products.
