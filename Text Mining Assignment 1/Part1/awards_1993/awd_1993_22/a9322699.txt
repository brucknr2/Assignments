Abstract    :
              9322699  Lomolina  The proposed study will provide important insights on two
              issues central to global efforts to conserve biodiversity, the effects of
              fragmentation and the potential benefits of corridors.  These studies will
              determine the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity of mammals inhabiting
              old-growth forests of the Olympic Peninsula.  We will use spatial analysis
              techniques to investigate how the structure of old-growth forest communities
              reflects differences amount species, forest fragments and surrounding
              landscapes.  Subsequently, we will use  these patterns to assess the importance
              of corridors and the habitat matrix, on the biodiversity of old-growth forest
              mammals, and landscape features which favor immigrations of forest mammals.   
              %%%  We will adopt a multiscale, or hierarchical approach in our attempt to
              assess the effects of fragmentation of old-growth forests.  Field studies will
              employ a combination of livetrapping, sign (tracks, scats, etc.), habitat and
              camera surveys conducted in nine continuous forest sites, 30 fragments of
              old-growth forest, and 10 locations along corridors and within clearcuts. 
              Resultant data will be subjected to Monte Carlo, regression and correlation
              analyses to test predictions regarding fragmentation and biodiversity.  %%% 
              The information we will provide on distribution patterns in the fragmented
              landscape of Olympic National Forest will facilitate efforts to manage these
              forests for mammals and dependent species such as spotted owls.  This research
              also will provide general insights regarding forest fragmentation by serving as
              a rigorous case study that documents the effects of fragmentation and assesses
              the influence of key processes influencing biodiversity.
