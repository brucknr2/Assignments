Abstract    :
              9322338  Sherman       This award continues an active Research Experiences for 
              Undergraduates at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology for another  three-year
              period.  The program involves six undergraduates  working under the supervision
              of the principal investigator for a  period of seven weeks.  The research
              problems center on a group  theoretic interpretation of confidence intervals
              and counting  problems in finite groups with the general area of computational 
              finite group theory.  The primary tool in the program will be  MAGMA, a high
              level programming language which enables the user  to define the algebraic
              structure in which one wishes to  compute and which is not generally available
              to undergraduates.   The problems have been selected and the format for 
              faculty-student interaction has been designed  to encourage  students to
              develop from receivers of mathematical fact to  providers of mathematical fact
              and conjecture.  The participants  will learn group theory and algebra, gain
              experience in  mathematical research and mathematical exposition (written and 
              oral) and develop the facility to use a computer work station as  a
              mathematical tool. The more successful projects will be  presented at future
              professional meetings and possibly be  published in appropriate journals.  ***
