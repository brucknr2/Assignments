Abstract    :
              9322304  Ellis       This grant will support the undergraduate summer experience
               of six to eight students each year.  Half of the students will be  women
              specifically recruited from the Twelve College Exchange  Program already in
              place, and the other half will be Wesleyan  physics students.  The Physics
              Department will use this added  opportunity for physics summer research to
              bring more women into  physics by using the Twelve College Exchange Program to 
              significantly increase the pool of prospective women.  This  combination has
              the added benefit of eliminating the time  obstacle to real research
              involvement during only one summer.  The research will follow a semester or two
              of academic study at  the host institution (Wesleyan) and the participating
              students  will have already acclimated themselves to the environment within 
              the Physics Department by the beginning of the summer.  This will  integrate
              the summer research as part of a larger physics  experience for the student and
              at the same time make it more  productive for the host researcher.  ***
