Abstract    :
              9322728    Kurtz    This Small Businss Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project is development of a portable on-line X-ray diffraction system for
              in-situ measurement of microstructural material properties useful in the
              control of many industrial fabrication porcesses.  Phase I succcessfully
              demonstrated the system for real-time analysis of sputter-deposited platinum
              films.    The fiber-optic based device uses a position-sensitive scintillation
              detector (PSSD).  In Phase I it was modified for use on a vapor depostion
              chamber for simultaneous measurement of critical film parameters.  In Phase II
              detector system capabilities will be upgraded to provide simultaneous multiple
              peak monitoring on large commercial vapor deposition reactors.    The new X-ray
              diffraction system is expected to contribute greater yields and higher through
              put in semiconductor and other advanced materials production operations.
