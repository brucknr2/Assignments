Abstract    :
              9322328  Carothers       This award provides support for a group of six
              undergraduate  researchers in the mathematical sciences working at Hope
              College.   Each student will work on an individual research project with one 
              of four faculty advisors.  Projects have been chosen from  topology, dynamical
              systems, applied mathematics and analysis.   Students and faculty will also
              participate in a seminar of  general interest.  Students will read both
              expository and  research papers and will make most of the presentations. A
              large  undergraduate program is scheduled each summer at Hope College  allowing
              many opportunities for interactions among students from  different fields of
              interest.       The program duration is eight weeks.  Students will  be
              strongly encouraged to present their work at  professional meetings or in
              published form. Office space, ample  computing resources and travel funds to
              professional meetings are  all provided.  A significant effort will be made to 
              attract applications from students in underrepresented groups.  ***
