                    93322456 ROWE  This project is to initiate a REU SITE in Oceanography at
              Texas A & M University. The program will support 12 students/year for three
              years in a 10 week program. Students will work either on the Galveston or
              College Station campus.  The unifying scientific theme for this project will be
              the structure and function of coastal ecosystems.
