              Abstract  ATM-9322768  Retelle, Michael J.  Bates College  Title: Laminated Lake
              Sediments from the Canadian High Arctic:  Understanding the Climatic Signal for
              Paleoclimatic Reconstruction    Synopsis.  Ice core and other paleoclimatic
              records from the High  Arctic suggest that summer temperatures reached minimum
              levels for  the entire Holocene during the last 500 years, but underwent a 
              dramatic reversal in the last 100 years.  This award, under the  Paleoclimate
              from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE) program is  designed to study lake
              sediments from a number of sites to  determine if this hypothesis is supported
              by the sedimentary  record.    To better understand the paleoclimatic signal in
              the sediments, a  three year process-based study is planned to determine the
              primary  controls on sediments flux and varved sediment formation in Sophia 
              Lake, a High Arctic hypersaline, meromictic lake.  Sophia Lake  provides a
              simple topographic environment, which will facilitate  efforts to isolate the
              primary climatic forcing.  Sediments from  lakes on the margin of Agassiz Ice
              Cap will also be recovered in  order to link the paleoclimatic record of ice
              cores from the ice  cap to sedimentary records from the glacier margin,
