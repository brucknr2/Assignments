Abstract    :
              9322426  Weidner       The Center for High Pressure Research, an NSF Science and
               Technology Center, was founded in 1991 as a research program to  probe the
              physical and chemical properties of materials with a  particular emphasis on
              the use of high pressure.  University at  Stony Brook, joined by Princeton
              University, and the Geophysical  Laboratory form the core institutions in the
              Center.  With this  application, the Stony Brook arm of the Center (the Mineral
              Physics  Institute) is proposing to expand and formalize an existing summer 
              program which enables selected undergraduates to participate in the  excitement
              of the advances made in this environment.  While the  research program will be
              housed at Stony Brook, we will provide an  opportunity for the students to
              visit the other laboratories and  institutions involved in the Science and
              Technology Center. Our  goal with the proposed program is to expose a limited
              number of  undergraduates to frontier science with the hope that they will be 
              stimulated to the point of pursuing a career in research science.
