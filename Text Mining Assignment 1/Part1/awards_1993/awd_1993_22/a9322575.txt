Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-22575    This award provides funding for acquisition of shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V ISELIN, a 170 foot vessel, or the R/V CALANUS, a 64 foot
              vessel.  Both vessels are owned and operated by the University of Miami as
              research vessels in support of oceanographic research.  Instrumentation
              requested includes  computer hardware for the ISELIN, upgrades to
              meteorological sensors, a high speed modem for data communications, a 3-D GPS
              system, a fluorometer, a clean water system for the CALANUS, and a depth
              sounder.  The instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-funded
              cruises aboard the ISELIN and the CALANUS during 1994 and will enhance the
              scientific capability of the vessels in the future.
