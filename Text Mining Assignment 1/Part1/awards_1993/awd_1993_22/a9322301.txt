Abstract    :
              9322301  Garg    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for eight 
              undergraduate students to work with four faculty members in  the Physics
              Department during a ten week summer period in  theoretical and experimental
              condensed matter physics.  Research projects to be undertaken include:  Chaos
              in  polymer dispersed liquid crystals; critical phenomena in  binary fluid
              mixtures; spatiotemporal chaos; and  thermodynamic studies of monolayer phase
              diagrams.  %%%  The goals of this program are to guide students in the  process
              and methodology of research, and to train the novice  research student into
              becoming an independent thinker.  At  the start of the summer, students will be
              assigned a  research project, and will work in close collaboration on a  daily
              basis with an individual faculty member.  They will  learn research techniques,
              report progress during weekly  seminars, and be given an opportunity of
              attending a  regional and/or national meeting of the American Physical  Society
              and Conferences on Undergraduate Research.  Some  students will present
              research findings in the same sessions  as leading scientists.  Students will
              be recruited from the  College of Wooster and other institutions in the 
              geographical area.  Emphasis will be place on increasing the  participation of
              historically underrepresented groups in the  sciences.  ***
