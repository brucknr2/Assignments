Abstract    :
              9322697  Winn  The Objective of this project is to gather quantitative
              information  about the electrical activity inside or near tornado funnels.  Ten
               instruments that measure the amplitude of the electric field will  be placed
              at intervals of about 5000 meters on the ground across  the anticipated paths
              of tornados in Oklahoma in 1994 and 1995.   The electric field measurements
              will be part of a major study of  tornadic storms known as VORTEX.  The
              development and motion of the  tornadic clouds and of the tornados themselves
              as depicted by video  recordings, radars and the locations of lightning flashes
              will  provide an essential framework for interpreting the electric field 
              measurements.
