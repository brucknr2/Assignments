Abstract    :
              This research is providing a parameterization of the entire family  of
              multidimensional perfect reconstruction subband coding filter  banks.  The
              motivation for doing this lies in practical application  of efficient coding
              and compression of image (video) type signals.   The parametric description of
              the family of multidimensional filter  banks so obtained is being used to
              design perfect reconstruction  filter banks having desirable frequency
              separation properties.  The  entire family of nonseparable multidimensional
              smooth wavelets  resulting from iterations of these filter banks is also being 
              completely parameterized in this way.    The techniques being adopted
              essentially consist of those from  multidimensional system theory.  The
              biorthogonal problems are  being approached by formulating them as matrix
              extension or matrix  completion problems in the ring of multidimensional
              polynomials or  stable proper rational functions; and the paraunitary problems
              as  problems of describing, or equivalently, synthesizing  multidimensional
              lossless systems.  Similar strategies are being  used in the acausal
              formulation as well as in dealing with special  classes of solutions such as
              the linear phase solutions.
