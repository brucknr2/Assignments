Abstract    :
              9322283  Berkowitz  This award provides funds to continue this successful
              program for another three years.  The  Institute of Ecosystem Studies' Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (IES-REU) program  immerses students in a highly
              interactive, research-oriented environment.  Our major tenet is  that success
              in science depends on understanding the context of research, as well as the 
              substance and procedures of a particular discipline.  Program goals are: (1) to
              provide  intensive training in ecological research: (2) to broaden students'
              perspectives on the societal,  ethical and theoretical contexts of science: and
              (3) to give students direct exposure to the life  of a research scientist. 
              Eight students will be brought to the Institute for a twelve-week  program in
              each of the next three summers, building upon the strengths of  highly
              successful  1988-1993 programs.  The program  includes the following
              components: (1) Student  Research Projects; (2) Research Strategies for the
              Undergraduate, providing explicit training  in and reflection on the research
              process; (3) Research in Context, involving a diverse set of  programs and
              activities to broaden students' perspectives on the various contexts and 
              applications of science; (4) a full-day Forum on Opportunities in Ecology to
              expose students  to a broad range of perspectives on the role of ecology and
              ecologists in the modem world;  (5) Supporting Activities, for group-building,
              exposure to ecology, etc.; and (6) Assessment  of Student Growth, both to guide
              the program and to gauge the breadth and quality of impacts  on student career
              development and their confidence, competence and understanding of  science. 
              Under the guidance of a mentor scientist, each student delineates a research
              question  and associated hypotheses. selects appropriate methods, and develops
              a research plan.   Students then implement the project, ending with analysis
              and report writing.  Presentations in  a formal Research Symposium conclude the
              summer program.  Final pa pers will be collated  and published as an IES
              Miscellaneous Publication.  ***
