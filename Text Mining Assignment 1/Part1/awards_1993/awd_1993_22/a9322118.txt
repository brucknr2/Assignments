Abstract    :
              9322118  Crawford         The proposed research will simulate the predicted 
              hypervelocity interactions of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e fragments  with the
              Jovian atmosphere using a computational approach.  The  goal of the simulations
              is to provide immediate information for  other predictive investigations and
              guidance for observations of  the event.         Two and three-dimensional
              simulations of the individual bolide  events will be made.  These simulations
              will provide estimates of  the penetration depth, the mode of fragmentation and
              bolide  dispersion, the mechanism of energy deposition and energy  deposition
              rates within different regions of the atmosphere, and  quantify the effect of
              impact obliquity and bolide irregularities.   These results will be made
              avialable to atmospheric modelers as  quickly as possible to aid in estimates
              of potential long-lived  observable features such as gravity waves and material
              upwelling in  the Jovian atmosphere.  ***
