Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   is
              focused on the development of Field Flow Fractionation (FFF), a   technique
              based on the use of orthogonal force fields to separate large   molecules and
              small particles.  The analyte mixture is pumped into a   rectangular channel,
              and a force is applied 90 degrees relative to the   direction of flow.  In
              particular, this grant will explore the use of   thermal gradients and
              gravitational forces to effect the separation.  In   addition, analytical split
              flow thin cell (SPLITT) fractionation, a   method where the separation occurs
              along the channel width, and where   splitters are used at one or both ends of
              the channel, is investigated to   determine it's potential for analytical
              separations.  Here, the   separation is based on hydrodynamic lift forces,
              which allows   characterization of species based on diffusion coefficients. 
              These   techniques can be used to characterize a variety of biological and  
              synthetic materials.    This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program will support   research into improved methods for the separation of
              large molecules and   small particles using field flow fractionation.  This is
              a procedure   invented by Professor Giddings in which crossed force fields are
              used to   separate small (micron-sized) particles or molecules based on
              differences   in shape, density, and electrical characteristics.  This
              methodology will   have wide-ranging applications in the fields of
              biotechnology and   materials science.
