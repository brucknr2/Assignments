Abstract    :
              9322427  Rodriguez  This is a Minority Research Initiation award to conduct
              theoretical  research on strongly correlated electrons in two dimensions within
               the context of high temperature superconductivity.  Within the  framework of a
              lightly doped antiferromagnet, the experimentally  relevant question of the
              magnetoresistance expected in such systems  will be explored.  Existing data on
              magneto-transport will be  interpreted within this scheme.  Spin-charge
              separated  superconductivity itself will be studied in two dimensions with 
              particular emphasis on uncovering the Kosterlitz-Thouless  transitions that
              exist in such systems.  Suggestions that Mott  transitions in strongly
              interactiong two-dimensional electron  systems may induce corresponding
              structural phase transitions will  also be studied.  The objective of the
              research is to provide a  theoretical understanding of the structural
              transitions present in  oxide superconductors.  An additional project will
              involve studies  of two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets having static
              defects.  %%%  This Minority Research Initiation award involves theoretical 
              research relating to the high temperature superconductors.  The  Principle
              Investigator will use sophisticated theoretical  techniques to study systems of
              strongly interacting electrons in  two dimensions, i.e., in a flat plane. 
              These models are thought to  be relevant to the oxide superconductors which
              consist of planes of  atoms.  Contact will be made to experimental
              measurements.  ***
