Abstract    :
              9322707  Ruskai  This project is a block travel grant for scientists to travel
              to  XI-th International Congress on Mathematical Physics (ICMP)  sponsored by
              the International Association of Mathematical  Physics (IAMP) to be held in
              Paris, France on 18-22 July, 1994.  These meetings afford a unique opportunity
              for mathematical  physicists to see the latest developments in the wide range
              of  topics under the umbrella of mathematical physics. A major  portion of the
              funds go to support participation of new  scientists and researchers from
              underrpresented groups. The  project will enable US scientists to remain at the
              cutting edge  of research in mathematical physics.  ***
