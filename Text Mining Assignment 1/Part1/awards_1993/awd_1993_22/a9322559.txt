Abstract    :
              9322559  Meyer  Johns Hopkins University  An international collaboration between
              Dr. Gerald J. Meyer, Johns Hopkins University and Dr. Carlo A. Bignozzi,
              University of Ferrara, Italy, to develop new techniques for
              light-to-electricity conversion is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
              and Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Division of International
              Programs. Nanostructured photoanodes using sol-gel processing and novel charge
              mediating coordination complexes will be prepared. The resulting cells will be
              characterized and their operating mechanism will be determined. The limiting
              steps and undesirable reactions which occur in these systems will be evaluated
              and utilized to optimize their long term performance.  The attachment of
              transition metal complexes, which will transfer charge when exposed to light,
              to high surface area oxide electrodes offers an opportunity to improve the
              efficiency of photoelectric cells. In this project new methods for preparing
              the requisite metal-oxides and new types of metal compounds for light induced
              charge transfer will be developed at Johns Hopkins and Ferrara Universities,
              respectively. The two will be combined into new photoelectric devices whose
              properties will be evaluated and optimized at Johns Hopkins.
