Abstract    :
              9322184  Mulekar       This award provides funding for a Research Experiences
              for  Undergraduates site supporting 10 undergraduate researchers.  The  program
              focuses on the use of statistical methodology for  research in several
              disciplines.  Using a combination of research  sessions and small discussion
              groups, the participating students  will work on individual case studies. 
              Students will be provided  a research experience in the guided and
              collaborative project  selected by them on the basis of summary descriptions of
              the  projects and discussions with the supervisor.  The will receive  a review
              of technical writing, presentation styles,  career opportunities in statistics,
              graduate admissions,  financial aid for graduate studies and so on.  Students
              will be  recruited primarily from the Southeastern United States.   Follow-up
              activities include extensions of student research  programs, presentations at
              professional meetings and personal  visits to the students' home institutions
              and discussions with  their faculty.  ***
