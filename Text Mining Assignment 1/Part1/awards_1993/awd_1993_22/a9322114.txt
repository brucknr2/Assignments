Abstract    :
              9322114  Duncan       A number of theoretical investigations in Quantum Field 
              Theory and specific aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and  the Standard
              Model of Electroweak physics will be carried out.  The methods employed will
              mostly be nonperturbative, including  Monte Carlo simulations in lattice QCD,
              analytic improvement of  perturbation theory, and 1/N expansions.  The lattice 
              calculations will lead to high-precision first-principle  evaluations of decay
              constants and mass splittings in the B-meson  system, of central importance for
              upcoming studies of B-meson  phenomenology in B-factories.  Nonperturbative
              techniques are  essential for attacking problems in strongly-coupled field- 
              theories such as QCD.  The problems attacked represent  fundamental issues of
              topical interest in Quantum Field Theory  and matters of direct
              phenomenological relevance to current and  future generations of particle
              accelerators.  ***
