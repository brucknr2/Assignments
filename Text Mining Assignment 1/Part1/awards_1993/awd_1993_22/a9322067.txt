Abstract    :
              9322067  Orel       This proposal addresses a number of questions concerning 
              electron polyatomic ion scattering.  These include  photoionization of simple
              polyatomic molecules, dissociative  recombination, and photoionization of
              absorbed molecules on  surfaces.  The results are important in low temperature
              plasmas  such as those which occur in plasma etching and the interstellar 
              medium.  ***
