Abstract    :
              Professor Mark Ediger is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental characterizations   of
              the glass transition in supercooled organic liquids such as   o-terphenyl,
              glycerol and trinaphthylbenzene.  Time resolved optical   spectroscopy on
              dilute solutions of rigid probes will be used.    Measurements of pattern
              photobleaching of the optical probes will be used   to determine how the
              rotational and translational motions decouple near   the glass transition
              temperature.  These experiments are motivated by   results from a number of
              laboratories which indicate that translational   motion has a significantly
              weaker temperature dependence than rotational   motion as the glass transition
              is approached.  The extent to which   decoupling is observed for probes of
              different sizes will clarify the   nature of the cooperative motion in
              supercooled liquids.    In the last 25 years, physical chemists have made
              significant progress in   the molecular interpretation of the static and
              dynamic properties of the   liquid state. The relationship between
              intermolecular potentials and   liquid structure is now well understood, and
              the role that solvent   friction plays in molecular reorientation and chemical
              reactions is also   understood for liquids of low viscosity.  Nevertheless, the
              properties of   supercooled liquids, and the molecular motions which occur near
              the glass   transition temperature, are still not well understood.  The
              experiments   being conducted by Ediger are designed to shed light on the
              anomalous   rotational and translational motions which occur in viscous
              supercooled   liquids in the region near the glass transition temperature.
