Abstract    :
              9322105  Shreve       This REU site award supports an undergraduate applied 
              mathematics summer institute consisting of ten students working  on open-ended
              problems using numerical and analytic approaches to  attack them.  To assist
              the investigations, the high level  programming language Maple will be
              introduced along with rigorous  training in mathematical analysis.  Problems
              areas include  nonlinear analysis, numerical methods in partial differential 
              equations, free boundary problems and random walk models of stock  prices
              applied to securities.  There will be a weekly  seminar series.  The
              institution will provide additional funds  for two more student participants.  
                  Students will be encouraged to participate in  professional meetings,
              presenting the results of their work  orally or in written for publication.
