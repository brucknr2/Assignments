Abstract    :
              9322705  Swift  Research conducted by this award is a component of the 1994
              U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section (AOS).  The AOS is a collaborative effort with
              Canada that involves approximately 60 scientists participating on a Canadian
              and a U.S. icebreaker during a 55-day field program in the summer of 1994.  The
              AOS is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change
              Research Program and research is jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean
              Sciences, the Office of Polar Programs and Office of Naval Research (ONR). 
              Data collected should be relevant to improving our understanding of how the
              Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects
              the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans
              and regions.    This project encompasses a service and research program.  The
              Oceanographic Data Facility (ODF) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography
              will conduct a detailed hydrographic survey consisting of about 100 precision
              temperature, conductivity, oxygen, and nutrient profiles at approximately 30 km
              intervals along the cruise track.  Resulting data will be shared with all
              participants.  Swift will use the hydrography data to focus on a study of the
              origin and circulation of the intermediate and deep waters of the Arctic Ocean
              and nearby seas.  Parameters to be determined are the surface-to-bottom
              distributions and sources of the physical and chemical characteristics, and the
              location, origin, and the structure of sub-surface boundary currents. 
              Information thus obtained will augment other studies during the AOS and will
              contribute to studies of the response of the regimes to environmental forcing.
