Abstract    :
                  9322302  Weidner      This award provides funds to continue a successful REU
              Site at Furman University for  another year.  The proposed program will provide
              a stimulating biological research  experience for twelve talented students
              recruited from Furman University and smaller,  less research-oriented colleges
              in South Carolina.  The program is especially aimed at  women, minority
              students, and persons with disabilities; and such individuals will make  up the
              majority of the participants.  Approximately half of the students will be
              rising  seniors and half will be rising sophomores.  Approximately six research
              groups will be  formed, with the majority of groups consisting of a senior, a
              sophomore, and a  faculty research director.  Research areas range from ecology
              to molecular biology.  The  The goal of the program his to support productive,
              publishable research involving  undergraduates, with a special focus on
              promising younger students.  The program builds  on a strong tradition of
              undergraduate research in a liberal arts environment at Furman  University and
              a successful NSF/REU program over the past two summers.  ***
