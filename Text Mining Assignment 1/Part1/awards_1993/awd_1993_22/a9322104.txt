Abstract    :
              The excellent research facilities, the dedicated teaching  and research faculty,
              and research staff and the commitment  to higher education by the State
              establishes the University  of Virginia in Charlottesville as an ideal setting
              for an  REU Site.  This program will continue with 16 undergraduate  students
              with approximately half from U Va and the other  half from other institutions. 
              Projects cover a broad range  of experimental research including nuclear and
              high energy  physics, atomic, molecular, condensed matter and biological 
              physics providing an opportunity for students with a wide  range of interests. 
              In particular, students will learn  about the structure of light nuclei,
              electron and proton  scattering from nuclei, momentum analysis with magnetic 
              spectrometers, scintillator and surface barrier particle  detectors, gas
              handling systems for accelerators, digital  and analog electronics, computer
              hardware and software,  ultra-low temperature, adiabatic demagnetization, ultra
              high-  vacuum techniques, studies of gas adsorption on graphite,  laser
              spectroscopy techniques for the study of molecules and  atoms interacting with
              external fields, x-ray diffraction  from macromolecules, hyperthermia studies
              of deep seated  brain tumors, optical absorption studies of hemeproteins and 
              gravitational phenomena.  Students will participate over a  ten week period in
              the summer and U Va students will  continue throughout the academic year.
