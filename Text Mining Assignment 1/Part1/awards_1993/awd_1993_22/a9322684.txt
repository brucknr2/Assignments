Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  
              Program, seeks to develop methods for the characterization of chiral  
              compounds using lanthanide ion based chemical shift reagents in nuclear  
              magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).  Cyclodextrins are used as chiral  
              complexing agents, and lanthanide chelates are chemically coupled to the  
              cyclodextrins.  Chemical shifts are observed in the NMR spectra which are  
              dependent on which enantiomer is complexed by the cyclodextrin.    This study
              addresses an important problem in biotechnology and   pharmaceutical research. 
              Many physiologically active drugs are only   effective in one configuration;
              the chemically identical mirror image of   the compound may be totally
              ineffective.  It is therefore critical to be   able to determine the
              composition of mixtures of these mirror image   compounds (enantiomers) that
              result from the synthetic procedure.  The   methodology based on magnetic
              resonance spectroscopy being developed at   Bates College will allow two
              enantiomers to be distinguished, and  may   also allow the absolute
              configuration of the compounds to be determined.
