Abstract    :
              We propose research on Bayesian representation and inference  methods in AI,
              focused especially on decision-making in dynamic  environments.  Dynamic
              environments provide both an opportunity and  a challenge to intelligent
              systems research:  the flexibility  required to perform well in such
              environments will most likely  demand AI methods, but AI research traditionally
              has focused on  more static environments.  The proposed research builds on our 
              current research on inference in Bayes nets, and focuses on real-  time
              inference and dynamic representation construction.  The  results will
              contribute to our understanding of the problems of and  potential for
              decision-theoretic techniques in dynamic  environments, and will provide a
              decision-theoretic foundation for  complex real-time monitoring, assessment,
              and control applications.
