Abstract    :
              9322112  Cotter       Ten women will be involved in field and laboratory
              research to  determine the origin of glacial and postglacial deposits in west- 
              central Minnesota.  This includes the continuation of three closely  related
              projects which have in common the utilization of till  provenance analysis to
              determine the origin and glacial history of  three problematic deposits.  These
              deposits are, 1) the Alexandria  Moraine Complex, 2) Tunnel Valley Eskers, and
              3) the striated and  faceted Boulder Pavement of the Minnesota River Valley.  
              Additionally, paleoenvironmental studies of lacustrine deposits  will be
              expanded and will include micropaleontological,  palynological and geochemical
              investigations.       U.M.M., an undergraduate institution, offers excellent 
              facilities and close faculty contact.  R.E.U. women will have the  opportunity
              to develop collegial ties with other undergraduates  doing geologic research
              and to serve as mentors, instructors and  role models to underrepresented high
              school students participating  in college level research.  The research
              experience and the unique  opportunity to interact with a scientific community
              when  underrepresented individuals are in the majority will both break  down a
              number of traditional barriers and aid in the maturation of  these students as
              scientists.  The culmination to the program, the  "Friends of UMM REU"
              conference, will provide these women with the  opportunity to present results
              and discuss ideas with experts in  the field.  Additionally a field trip to the
              Canadian Rockies will  show participants active glacial processes and glacial 
              environments.  The REU program will contribute to the personal  growth of these
              women and the research to be accomplished will  contribute to the understanding
              of the glacial history of  Minnesota.
