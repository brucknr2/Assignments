Abstract    :
              9322087  Greenberg  Colorado State University  Dr. Marc M. Greenberg and other
              members of the Chemistry Department of Colorado State  University are being
              supported  for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in 
              Chemistry.  For the period 1994-6,  six undergraduate students will spend ten
              weeks each  summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.  The
              focus of the program will be  on chemical synthesis.
