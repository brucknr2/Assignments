Abstract    :
                  9322164  Gegenheimer          This award provides funds to the Department of
              Biochemistry at The University  of Kansas to support a Summer Research
              Experience for Undergraduates in  Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a program
              for 10 weeks in the summer of 1994.   Recognizing the pivotal role of
              independent laboratory research in students' decisions to  make a commitment to
              research careers in the biological sciences, this opportunity will  be provided
              to students from colleges with limited research opportunities, and to  members
              of groups traditionally underrepresented in the fields of biochemistry and 
              molecular biology.  The program focuses on several overlapping areas of
              biochemistry  and molecular biology, principally protein structure and
              function, enzyme mechanisms,  and protein engineering; proteins involved in
              cytoskeletal structure; the structure,  function, and regulation of membrane
              proteins--receptors, ion channels and ion  transporters--and of their genes;
              and molecular developmental biology.  To maximize the  unique  opportunities
              offered at The University of Kansas, students will be involved in  several
              collaborative projects combining classical protein structure analysis, genetic 
              engineering and physical biochemical approaches.  Early hands-on experience
              with these  powerful techniques in a carefully controlled environment awakens
              students' excitement.   This experience will provide the students with an
              inside view of these areas of  biochemistry and molecular biology that may
              previously have seemed inaccessible to  them.  ***
