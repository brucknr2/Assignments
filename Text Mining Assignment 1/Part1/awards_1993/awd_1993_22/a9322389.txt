Abstract    :
              9322389  Ellis    Technical abstract:  Third sound waves will be used to study
              the  properties of vortices in superfluid 4He films at low temperatures.  
              These vortices have been recently shown to exist well below the  superfluid
              transition, pinned to the substrate and stable against  moderate film flow. 
              Large amplitude third sound waves not only  provide film flow large enough to
              move the vortices, but are able  to create and destroy the vortices by the
              quantum-mechanical  analogy of swirling.  Small amplitude waves are used to
              probe the  vortex distribution.  This detailed study of vortex pinning and 
              creation will provide better understanding of the importance of  innate
              vortices at low temperatures and their properties.    Non-technical abstract: 
              This research will investigate the  properties of microscopic quantized
              circulation states in thin  films of superfluid helium.  These vortices have
              been shown to play  a role in the properties of films near the superfluid
              transition  temperature and will be studied directly for the first time at 
              lower temperatures by their interaction with sound waves.  Unlike  its
              counterpart superconductivity, there remain fundamental  problems in the
              microscopic description of the superfluid state and  clarifying the role of the
              vortices in films will contribute to the  general understanding of condensed
              matter physics.  ***
