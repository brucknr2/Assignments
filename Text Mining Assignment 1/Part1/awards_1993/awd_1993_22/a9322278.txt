Abstract    :
              Madden  9322278       This award provides funds for the expansion of a Research 
              Experiences for Undergraduates Program at Louisiana State  University.  The
              project will support twelve students through  institutional resources and
              additional four from this grant.  The  program runs for eight weeks focusing on
              research in the areas of  algebraic geometry and knot theory.  Two faculty
              advisors will  coordinate the effort.  Students will work in small groups and
              be  expected to make presentations during the course of the program. 
              Interspersed will be lectures by visiting scientists.   All participants will
              be expected to write up the results of  their experience with the more
              successful preparing papers for  publication or presentation at professional
              meetings.       Recruiting will be done by personal visits to regional 
              institutions.  Efforts will be made to attract applications from  students in
              under represented groups.  Availability of university  resources such as a
              computer laboratory will add to the strength  of the activity.  ***
