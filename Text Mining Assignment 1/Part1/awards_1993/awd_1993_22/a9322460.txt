Abstract    :
              9322460  Godbole        This award provides support for a group of six
              undergraduate  researchers in the mathematical sciences working at Michigan 
              Technological University.  Students will  work on individual  research projects
              in the areas of combinatorics, graph theory and  number theory.  The theme of
              the program will be to used  applications from probability theory to achieve
              solutions to  problems in all three areas.  Students will travel with the 
              project director to the Summer Meeting of the American  Mathematical Society in
              Minneapolis at the end of the program.   Particular emphasis will be placed on
              developing student  abilities at presenting results, both written and oral.    
                Computing resources and office space will be provided for  the students. 
              They will be housed in university apartments.   A strong record of recruiting,
              especially among underrepresented  groups, will again be reflected in this
              project. The program  will run for an eight week period.  ***
