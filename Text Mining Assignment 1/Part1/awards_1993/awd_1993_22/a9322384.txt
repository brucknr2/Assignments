Abstract    :
              9322384  Wu         This award is for measuring (1) high-resolution high-,
              room-,  and low-temperature photoabsorption cross sections of molecular 
              nitrogen and (2) the temperature-dependent fluorescence cross  sections for
              producing the N I emissions through photodissociative  excitation of molecular
              nitrogen and that for producing the N II  1085 and 916 angstrom emissions
              through dissociative  photoionization excitation of molecular nitrogen, from
              their  respective thresholds to 200 angstroms.  Such cross sections are 
              required for accurate quantitative analysis and evaluation of the  nitrogen
              dayglow models of the Earth, Titan and Triton.  ***
