Abstract    :
              9322360  Hill         The investigators propose to carry out theoretical 
              investigations of the plasma interactions associated with the  impending
              encounter of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy-9 fragments with  Jupiter and its
              magnetosphere.  They will concentrate on  potentially observable consequences
              of the interaction of comet  material with the magnetosphere, both before and
              after the impact  episode.  Because the comet is already fragmented and carries
               significant dust (and perhaps gas) components, its interaction with  Jupiter's
              magnetosphere may well have observable effects upon its  first encounter with
              the bow shock or magnetopause, about a month  before planetary impact.  These
              effects include electrostatic  disruption of grains, copious ionization, and
              the intriguing  possibility of remote optical imaging of the magnetospheric 
              boundary.  During and after the impact episode, magnetospheric  convection may
              be influenced by the mass-loading effect of comet  ejecta, with observable
              consequences in the optical Io torus, the  Jovian aurora, and Jovian radio
              emissions.  The theoretical  investigation of these phenomena will combine
              analytical and tested  numerical techniques, and will be carried out in close
              conjunction  with relevant observational programs to maximize the scientific 
              return from this rare celestial event.  ***
