Abstract    :
              9322653  Baldwin       An educational series on Integrated Product and Process
              Design  from the National Technological University is now available on  video
              tape.  It can be used by engineering faculty to help students  understand the
              views of a number of academic, industry and  government leaders on the subject.
               Selected videos could replace  and/or supplement the visits by such people to
              classrooms.       This project assists in funding the intellectual content of 
              the series, thereby reducing the required selling price to academe.  It is a
              marketing experiment which will make an assessment of  faculty willingness to
              use such resources if they are readily  available.
