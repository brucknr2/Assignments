Abstract    :
              9322008  Eglin  Dr. Judith Eglin and other members of the Chemistry Department
              of  Mississippi State University are being supported for a Research 
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the  period 1994-6,
              eight students will spend ten weeks each summer  actively engaged in a variety
              of projects. Projects cover the  traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,
              inorganic, organic,  physical and biochemistry.  A unique feature will be the
              focus on  four year colleges particularly on those lacking research  programs
              in the region.
