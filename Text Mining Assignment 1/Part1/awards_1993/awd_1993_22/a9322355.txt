Abstract    :
              In recent work a new and widely applicable approach to the theory  of large
              deviations has been developed by Paul Dupuis of Brown  University and this
              investigator.  In this approach many aspects  of the theory of large deviations
              are reduced to the theory of  weak convergence of probability measures.  This
              research treats  new applications of this weak convergence approach to a number
              of  important problems.  The method also gives rise to several  computational
              questions that are currently under investigation.   Areas of application
              include a general class of queuing networks  and several models in statistical
              mechanics.  The theory of large deviations is an important area of 
              probabilistic research having applications to a number of areas  including
              statistics, statistical mechanics, and queuing theory.   In recent work a new
              and widely applicable approach to the theory  of large deviations has been
              developed by Paul Dupuis of Brown  University and this investigator.  This
              approach may give new  insight into large deviation phenomena and allow
              researchers to  determine computationally the accuracy of the theory.  A main 
              area of application of will be to queuing systems, which arise in  the modeling
              of computer networks.
