Abstract    :
              9322142  Sharifnia  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will
              involve  undergraduates with the application of the dynamic systems, control 
              theory, and operations research to important manufacturing  engineering
              problems.  Specific research areas include design and  operation of
              manufacturing systems, robotics, and manufacturing  processes.  The research
              projects will address modeling, analysis,  control, and performance evaluation
              aspects of these systems or  processes.   ***
