Abstract    :
              9322115  Elliot    Stellar occultations can probe ring systems and atmospheres
              of planets in  the outer Solar System with spatial resolutions of a few
              kilometers -- about  a thousand times better than the resolution of any other
              Earth-based  method.  Drs. James Elliot and Heidi Hammel will observe the
              highest  quality occultations by the giant planet systems that occur during the
               period 1994-1998.  They will use these data to investigate various physical 
              characteristics of rings and/or atmospheres of Uranus, Jupiter, Saturn,  Titan,
              and Neptune.  The first year of the award includes support to  involve
              undergraduate students in the research effort.
