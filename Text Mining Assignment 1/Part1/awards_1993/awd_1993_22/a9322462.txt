	Plants display and impressive array of characters
              thought to defend them against attack by herbivores and pathogens.  Many
              biologists have interpreted the principal function of these plant  resistance
              characters to be the defense of the plant against its natural enemies. 
              However, others have suggested that these resistance characters serve other
              functions and that the effects of  these  characters on herbivores are
              incidental.   Despite this ambiguity, the interaction between herbivores and
              plant resistance characters has played a critical role in the development of
              theories on the coevolution of plants and herbivores. 
	Two assumptions mark
              theories on the evolution of plant resistance characters such as secondary
              chemicals and trichomes (1) resistance has evolved primarily as a defense
              against natural enemies of plants and (2) resistance is costly in terms of
              fitness to the plant.  Neither of these assumptions has been adequately tested.
               This research aims to test these assumptions using both laboratory strains and
              natural populations of the annual plant, Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae),
              in both the field and a growth chamber.  In particular, this research will use
              quantitative  genetical techniques to determine:  (1) whether herbivorous
              insects and pathogens exert selection on genetic variation for resistance and
              (2) whether resistance characters are evolutionarily costly.  The results of
              this research will shed light on the mechanisms of  the evolution of resistance
              in plants to herbivores and pathogens.
