Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Bruce Ault of the University of Cincinnati will use  
              matrix isolation spectroscopy to study intermediates formed during   Chemical
              Vapor Deposition (CVD) processes.  Through these studies Ault   hopes to
              identify the initial steps in the mechanism of CVD as well as   the role of
              gas-phase versus surface-mediated reactions.  Along the way   he will
              characterize the structure and bonding of unusual species   isolated during
              these experiments.  Ault will use quantum-mechanical   calculations to help
              identify and characterize new intermediates.  %%%  Chemical Vapor Deposition is
              used to produce a wide range of insulating,   semiconducting, conducting, and
              superconducting thin films having great   societal and commercial importance. 
              In this project, very low   temperature experiments using materials dispersed
              through rare-gas   solids, thin films, or solutions will be conducted to
              isolate and   preserve the intermediate products of the chemical reactions
              involved in   CVD processing.  Knowledge of these products and of the
              mechanisms of CVD   can allow improvement in both the efficiency and the
              quality of the final   products in thin film manufacturing.
