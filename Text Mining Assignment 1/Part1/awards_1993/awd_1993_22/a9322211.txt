Abstract    :
                  9322211  Wallace    This award provides to establish a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates Site at  Bucknell University.  Ten undergraduate students,
              five from Bucknell and five recruited  from schools around the country will
              spend ten weeks doing research in cell and  molecular biology with various
              faculty at Bucknell.  Research projects include topics in  cancer research,
              plant molecular biology, Drosophila molecular genetics, immunology,  and cell
              biology of the testis.  In addition to the work on their individual projects,
              the  students will (1) participate in a regular journal club, (2) attend two 
              demonstrations/workshops (put on by participating faculty) devoted to modern
              molecular  techniques, (3) attend the Summer Symposium in Molecular Biology at
              Penn State  University, and (4) participate in a minisymposium at the end of
              the summer where they  will present and discuss their work.  It is hoped that
              the combination of the detailed  individual research work with the broader
              perspectives given by the journal club,  workshops, and Penn State Symposium,
              will give the students a thorough exposure to a  research environment.  ***
