Abstract    :
              9322480  Holton         The objective of this research is the transfer of
              momentum,  energy, water substance and other trace constituents between the 
              troposphere and stratosphere by means of gravity waves and the mass 
              circulation.  Both processes will be investigated using selected  numerical
              models of convection and general circulation, whose  formulation will be guided
              by existing observations, including  those of 50 MHz radars.         In
              particular, a nonlinear model of the zonally symmetric mass  circulation will
              be utilized to determine whether the mass  transport into the tropical
              stratosphere is a consequence of remote  effects initiated in higher latitudes
              or partially the effect of  gravity wave drag arising from local convection or
              the subtropical  jet stream.  Most of the simulations will be accomplished
              using a  two dimensional model, thought a few three dimensional simulations 
              will be used to evaluate the merit of the former model.
