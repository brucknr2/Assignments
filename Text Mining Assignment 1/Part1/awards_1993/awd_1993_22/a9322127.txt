Abstract    :
              9322127  Cochran    The impact of the pieces of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on
              Jupiter will  probably release a large amount of energy into the Jovian
              atmosphere.   Dr. William Cochran and colleagues have formed a Comet Science
              Team  that will have the use of all of the facilities of the McDonald
              Observatory to  gather data on this event.  The Team will gather astrometric
              data and  physical observations on the comet during the months prior to the
              impact  event.  The pre-impact state of the Jovian atmosphere will be 
              characterized in detail.  During the time of the impact, areas to be 
              investigated include the fireball of heated gas rising from the entry site, 
              the cooling and condensation in the upper atmosphere of the warm  atmospheric
              and cometary material brought up from the deep atmosphere  by the fireball, the
              dynamics of the atmospheric reaction to the impact  event, the influence of the
              impact on the Jovian magnetosphere and  auroral emissions, and the study of
              possible newly formed chemical  species in the stratosphere.
