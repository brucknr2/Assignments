Abstract    :
              This grant from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will support  
              Professor Marshall's efforts to develop two new techniques involving   Fourier
              transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT/ICR/MS.    The first
              method is a new two dimensional approach that should give   tandem in time
              MS/MS to provide immediate identification of all the   coupled ion-molecule
              reactions occuring in a complex mixtures.  The   second technique involves the
              determination of the structure of gas-phase   ions trapped in the ICR cell by
              using infrared spectroscopy.    This research will extend Professor Marshall's
              extensive investigations   of the very powerful method of FT/ICR/MS for the
              characterization of   small amounts of material which can be selected and
              studied according to   their mass.  Advances in this area will allow a better
              understanding of   the fundamental chemistry that occurs between ions and
              molecules in the   gas phase.  This will allow for improved methods of analysis
              of trace   contaminants in a wide variety of sample types.
