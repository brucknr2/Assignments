Abstract    :
              9322061  Harmony  University of Kansas  Dr. Marlin D. Harmony  and other members
              of the Chemistry Department of the University of Kansas are being supported to
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates  (REU) site in Chemistry. 
              For the   period 1994-6, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each
              summer actively engaged  in a variety of research projects.  Projects cover the
              traditional areas of chemistry-analytical, inorganic, organic and physical in
              addition to bioorganic, biophysical and bioanalytical in collaboration  with
              the University's Center for Bioanalytical Research.   The primary source of the
              students will be students from small colleges in the region that are lacking in
              research facilities.
