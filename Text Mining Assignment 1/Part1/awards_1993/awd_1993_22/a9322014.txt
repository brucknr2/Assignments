Abstract    :
              9322014  Salah    The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will host eight 
              undergraduate students annually at its Haystack Observatory to  provide
              research experiences for undergraduates.  The Haystack  Observatory is a
              multi-disciplinary research center dedicated to  radio astronomical research
              using its 37-m diameter telescope and  to studies of the earth's upper
              atmosphere using its 46-m and 67-m  high power radars.  The students will be
              involved in the  acquisition of data using the instrumentation, analysis and 
              interpretation of the measurements, as well as development of  hardware and
              software to improve capabilities of the facility.   Astronomical studies
              involve the characterization of stellar and  quasar radio emission, starburst
              galaxies, and masters in our  galaxy.  Atmospheric studies will emphasize the
              effects of   geomagnetic storms on the structure and dynamics of the earth's 
              atmosphere and on spectral studies of periodic variations observed  in the
              upper atmosphere.  Technical projects include the digital  design of signal
              processing systems, tests of advanced recording  heads, and development of
              real-time control software.  The students  will work closely with a staff
              mentor throughout the summer, and  will prepare a report and presentation on
              their projects.  The  presentations will be given at national conferences, and 
              opportunities will be provided to continue some of the projects  during the
              academic year.  The students will be exposed to all  aspects of the research
              facility through seminars and  demonstrations at the various unique facilities,
              and will obtain a  thorough practical experience of scientific research at a
              facility  dedicated to research.      The Haystack Observatory has an excellent
              record of providing  research experiences to undergraduates.
