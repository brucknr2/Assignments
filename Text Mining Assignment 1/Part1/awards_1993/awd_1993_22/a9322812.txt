Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of California--Santa
              Barbara in the purchase of a 400  MHz NMR spectrometer.  This acquisition will
              enhance greatly the research in a number of  areas including the following: 
              the design and synthesis of molecules which can function as  sequence-specific
              catalysts of nucleic acid hydrolysis, the preparation of superstructural 
              porphyrins, the development of reagents for diastereoselective and
              enantioselective reductions,  studies of organocopper chemistry, the
              development of new synthetic methods in organometallic  chemistry, explorations
              of the Diels-Alder reaction, studies of diyl hydrogen abstraction  reactions
              including sequence-specific reactions of such species with nucleic acids,
              development  of the organic chemistry of substituted fullerenes, and the
              preparation and study of organic  polymers with unusual chemical and physical
              properties.    A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to
              obtain information about molecular  structure (what types of carbon and/or
              hydrogen atoms and/or hetero-atoms are present, what  are the relative number
              of each type of atoms and how are they connected to one another in the 
              molecule) and molecular dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the
              molecule moving).   This instrument is essential for any meaningful, modern
              synthetic chemistry research program.
