Abstract    :
                   This research project involves a modeling study of NOx  production by
              intracloud lighting and its subsequent variability in  time and space using the
              Storm Electrification Model (SEM)  developed at South Dakota School of Mines
              and Technology.  The SEM  is unique in its features as it pertains to studies
              of cloud  dynamics and microphysics, as well as cloud electrical development, 
              including a parameterization of the production of lightning.       The study
              will include four steps.  First, NO will be treated  as an inert gas and a
              vertical profile will be considered.   The NO  transport within the context of
              cloud evolution will be evaluated  and used later on to sort out lightning
              enhancement of NO  concentration.  Second, NO production by lightning will be 
              simulated using ideas of Borucki and Chameides (1984), without any  reactive
              chemistry.  Several parameter studies will be performed in  order to find
              answers to questions such as:  how lightning-produced  NO is transported within
              the cloud, where the maximum NOx  concentration would most probably be located
              within the cloud, and  how lightning location influences the NOx distribution
              within the  cloud.  The third step will include chemistry that leads to the 
              production of NO2 following the initial production of NO by  lightning.  The
              last step includes reactions of NO with peroxy  radicals.       This will be
              the first study that investigates the production  by lightning and subsequent
              distribution of NOx using a  sophisticated dynamical electrical model of
              thunderclouds.
