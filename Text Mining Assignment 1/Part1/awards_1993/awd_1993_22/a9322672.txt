The giant Galapagos tortoises (Geochelone elephantopus)
              at one time consisted of 15 recognized subspecies, five of which have vanished
              within the last few centuries.  The ten remaining subspecies are highly
              endangered, threatened today primarily by human-released feral animals.  These
              tortoises present an ideal model system for defining evolutionary significant
              units (ESU's) in the context of clearly declining populations with a complex
              taxonomic history.  Modern DNA technology provides the opportunity to conduct
              detailed conservation-genetic studies of these tortoises.  The Charles Darwin
              Research Station located in the Galapagos is about to undertake, for the first
              time, as complete a census as possible of all living giant tortoises, covering
              two to three subspecies per year over the next five years.  For eight of the
              ten extant subspecies, it is likely that all animals will be located, measured,
              weighed, marked, sexed, etc.  This proposal is to add the relatively minor
              procedure of drawing small amounts of blood for DNA analysis.  The major types
              of variation studied will be hypervariable regions associated with nuclear
              microsatellites and RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) variation
              in mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA), thus providing both Mendelian and maternal
              lineage data.  Sequence data will be collected from a more limited number of
              individuals for phylogenetic purposes.

The resulting data will address
              questions at the population level to higher-level phylogenetic/historical
              analysis.  In addition, the baseline genetic data will be provided for an
              ongoing release program on one of the islands.  While these will be the primary
              studies done in the laboratory, a major part of the proposal is to archive all
              DNA and blood to have it available to future projects; the kind of survey about
              to be conducted on these remarkable animals is unlikely to be repeated in the
              foreseeable future so this archived material will have long term value.
