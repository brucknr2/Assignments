Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the use of time-of-flight design  techniques in
              the design of optical computers.  This is a new  design approach that takes
              advantage of the absence of capacitive  and inductive effects, giving optical
              interconnects an advantage  over electrical one in high-speed digital systems. 
              As a result,  propagation delays can be precisely controlled in optical 
              interconnects and logic, thus mitigating problems such as clock  skew.  This
              feature of optics motivates a new method of digital  design, where latches used
              to synchronize signals are removed.  To  synchronize signals at logic gates,
              the designer instead relies on  adjustments of signal propagation delays. 
              Clock gating is used to  eliminate residual timing uncertainty which would
              cause phase drift  in feedback loops.  This new scheme eliminates latch
              overhead and  allows deep pipelining at the gate level.
