Abstract    :
              9322524  Krawinkler  This research project will develop basic data needed to 
              formalize and implement a demand/capacity based seismic  design methodology
              that explicitly considers the inelastic  response characteristics of
              structures.  The objective is to  make the design process transparent and
              equally applicable  to the seismic evaluation of existing structures and
              seismic  designs of new structures, using conventional structural  systems as
              well as new structural systems, materials, and  innovative energy dissipation
              or base isolation systems. The  design objective is to provide a structure with
              sufficient  strength, stiffness, and ductility such that the deformation 
              demands imposed by design earthquakes do not exceed the  deformation
              capabilities associated with design limit states  (e.g. serviceability,
              collapse safety).    It is intended to achieve a consistent level of seismic 
              protection for structures of different configurations and  structural systems,
              which may be located in regions of  different seismicity.  The proposed
              research is directed  towards achieving this goal by focusing on the following 
              objectives: (1) evaluate, refine, modify, and develop (if  needed) the basic
              concepts on which a consistent and  transparent seismic design methodology can
              be based; (2)  develop a comprehensive set of information on seismic demand 
              parameters for inelastic SDOF systems, which will form the  basis for the
              design of MDOF structures; (3) develop the  knowledge needed to modify the SDOF
              demand parameters in a  manner that accounts for multi-mode effects present in
              real  MDOF structures; (4) investigate the effects of ground  motion
              characteristics for expected cumulative damage  effects; and (5) formalize and
              test the proposed seismic  design methodology in order to make it useful for
              the  engineering profession.  The information on demands and  capacities
              created in the project will have an impact on the  state of knowledge and will
              facilitate and accelerate the  adoption of more realistic  and transparent
              design  procedures.  ***
