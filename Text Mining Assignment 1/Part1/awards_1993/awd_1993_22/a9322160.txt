Abstract    :
              9322160  Parsons  Dr. Edith J. Parsons and other members of the Chemistry 
              Department of Clemson University are being supported to continue  a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in  Chemistry. For the period of
              1994-96, eight undergraduate  students will spend ten weeks each summer
              actively engaged in a  variety of research projects. Projects cover the
              traditional  areas of chemistry- analytical, inorganic, organic and physical. 
              Students will be primarily from the ten-state region surrounding  Clemson.
