Abstract    :
              9322224  Boehm  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project at
              University  of Nevada-Las Vegas will involve undergraduates in research in the 
              areas of:  engineering system design, neural net feedback control  systems,
              fuzzy controls, and radiant barrier systems.  Particular  attention will be
              given to recruiting underrepresented minority  students.  ***
