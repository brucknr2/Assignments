Abstract    :
              9322591  Nair       Research in theoretical particle physics involves three 
              major topics in the standard model description of the basic  interactions of
              matter.  The first concerns the interactions  among quarks at high
              temperatures.  Such interactions play a  significant role in the early
              universe.  The second deals with  objects that can be formed in theories like
              the standard model,  which have unusual properties at macroscopic distances. 
              These  objects could underpin significant phenomena such as  superconductivity
              at high temperatures.  And finally, the third  topic concerns the properties of
              scattering processes involving  many particles.  These processes are quite
              important in high  energy collisions.  ***
