Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9322481  Dhir     Vapor-liquid interface shape during saturated or
              subcooled film boiling on a vertical surface is governed by Kelvin-Helmholtz
              Instability whereas it is the Raleigh-Taylor instability that governs the
              configuration of the interface during film boiling on horizontal surfaces. The
              evolution of the interface and the induced flow field govern the heat and mass
              transfer across the interface and in turn the heat transfer from the heater
              surface. In this study a complete numerical simulation of the evolution of the
              vapor-liquid interface and the accompanied flow and temperature field in the
              vapor and the liquid is proposed. The simulation will be carried out without
              introducing any empirical constants and will include both linear and non-linear
              growth of the interfacial instabilities. In the first phase, the effort will be
              limited to only two dimensions, and spectral collocation method along with
              SIMPLE algorithm will be used to numerically integrate the governing equations.
              The numerical results will also yield the wall superheats at which a continuous
              vapor film could not be supported on the heater surface. Thus the results will
              provide a completely theoretical basis for prediction of minimum heat fluxes.
              The numerical effort will be supported with experimental data already reported
              in the literature. If deemed necessary, existing experimental facilities will
              be used to obtain the required data on vertical and/or horizontal plates.
