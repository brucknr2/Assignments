Abstract    :
              9322173  Fabes    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for eight 
              undergraduates to gain research experience in electron  microscopy and
              microanalysis of advanced ceramic materials.  Students will initially take a
              one week intensive course to  gain a basic knowledge in micro structural
              characterization  of materials in general and to understand the concepts, 
              instrumentation and applications of scanning electron  microscopy and x-ray
              analysis.  Following this, students  will be integrated into numerous on-going
              research projects,  including:  laser processing of sol-gel coatings, structure
               of thin film ceramics, strengthening of glass by alkoxide  coatings, and
              processing of glass-ceramics from lunar  resources.  %%%  The goal of this
              program is to provide undergraduates with  an experience of the excitement as
              well as frustrations of  conducting research at the cutting edge of technology.
               It  is expected this experience will serve to inspire and  motivate students,
              as well as to help make career decisions,  increase interactions between
              students and faculty, and  expand job and graduate school choices upon
              graduation.  Emphasis will be placed on participation of Hispanic, women,  and
              community college students.  Students will be recruited  at the freshman and
              sophomore levels, allowing the REU  experience to impact career decisions
              before they are set.
