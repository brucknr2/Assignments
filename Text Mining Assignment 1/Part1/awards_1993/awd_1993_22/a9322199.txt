Abstract    :
              9322199  Anderson       This proposal offers undergraduate research experiences
              in a  ten-week program integrating the research activities of ten 
              investigators from Black Hills State University, the University of  Wyoming,
              the City of Spearfish, South Dakota, and the United States  Forest Service. 
              The specific research projects focus on the impact  of urban and rural
              activities within the City of Spearfish on the  quality of surface and
              groundwater, and on possible remediation  techniques.  All projects will
              utilize Black Hills State  University's newly purchased microcomputing
              facilities, including  a Macintosh Quadra computer laboratory and a
              IBM-compatible 486 lab  equipped with GIS and AutoCAD software.  The goals of
              our proposed  program are to give undergraduate students an opportunity to   1)
              participate in environmental research projects that utilize  high-end
              microcomputing facilities, 2) become acquainted with a  variety of related
              scientific subdisciplines, 3) improve their  scientific writing, 4) present
              research to their peers at the  National Conference on Undergraduate Research,
              and 5) disseminate  the research to the scientific community through
              publication.  The  overlying theme of the program is to expose students who are
              in the  early stages of a research career to environmental projects that 
              involve application of field, lab, and microcomputing skills.  We  believe that
              exposing students to a variety of related  environmental research topics will
              convince them to develop a  strong, interdisciplinary science and math
              background, and enhance  their research abilities.
