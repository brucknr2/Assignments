Abstract    :
                    9322152  Garey    This award will provide funds to the Department of
              Biological Sciences at Duquesne University to  establish a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site involving 8 students per year for 3  years. 
              Students from over 100 small regional colleges who might be reluctant to attend
              an REU site  at a larger university will be recruited.  Eight of the most
              enthusiastic, research-active faculty have  been selected to participate in the
              program.  Projects will be selected from the realm of the professor's  research
              and of sufficient quality and depth to be true learning experiences that will
              ask novel questions  and properly introduce students to research.  The students
              will spend ten weeks at Duquesne University  working in research laboratories
              in direct contact with faculty and other students.  Weekly  departmental-wide
              meetings will take place during the ten week program to exchange ideas about 
              scientific, philosophical, and practical aspects of research and careers in
              research.  These meetings will  also be used as peer review vehicles to ensure
              appropriate depth and scientific content of the students'  research projects. 
              The program will culminate in a poster session modeled after similar sessions 
              common in scientific meetings.  The effectiveness of the program will be
              monitored by participant  evaluations and long term monitoring of the students
              careers.  ***
