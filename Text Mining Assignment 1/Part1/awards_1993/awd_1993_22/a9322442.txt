Abstract    :
              9322442  Woodin       The focus of the project is the relationship between large
               cardinal axioms and determinacy axioms.  This is interpreted  somewhat broadly
              and is meant to include, for example, the study  of a new class of models. 
              These models are generated as forcing  extensions of models in which the axiom
              of determinacy holds.   They are interesting because they provide the first
              examples of  canonical models in which the Continuum Hypothesis is false.      
              One consequence of Kurt Godel's results of 60 years ago is  that there will
              always be mathematical problems which cannot be  solved.  This first became a
              practical concern 30 years ago when  Paul Cohen showed that Cantor's Continuum
              Hypothesis cannot be  settled.  Since Cohen's work, numerous problems have been
              shown  to be unsolvable.  The large cardinal hierarchy provides in many  cases
              a resolution to the problem of independence.  This is done,  not by resolving
              the question, but rather by calibrating the  degree to which it is unsolvable. 
              This hierarchy of axioms, each  of which asserts the existence of a new
              infinity, emerges as the  fundamental mathematical reality.  The investigator
              intends to  study this hierarchy in its many manifestations.  ***
