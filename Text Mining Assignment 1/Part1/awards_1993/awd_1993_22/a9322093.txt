Abstract    :
              9322093  BOWERS  This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental 
              Sciences at the University of Virginia to continue a successful  REU program
              for the next two years.  A10-week research program  for undergraduates will be
              conducted where basic principles of  ecology are taught, and the methods by
              which scientists increase  our understanding of the natural world detailed. 
              The program  will be comprised of three phases:  I -- Two weeks of formal 
              lectures detailing the scientific method, hypothesis testing and  experimental
              design; II -- 6 1/2 weeks of data collection and  experimentation; and III --
              1-1/2 weeks of data analysis,  interpretation and communication of results. 
              The goal is show  students how to "do" science and then give them an
              opportunity to  conduct original and independent field research.  Students are 
              sought from a diversity of backgrounds, interests and home  institutions.  The
              focus of the program will be on testing  hypotheses related to plant-animal
              interactions, population  dynamics, and conservation biology--topics that have
              considerable  basic/applied interest, and high heuristic value.  Students will 
              conduct research in a field-station setting at the Blandy  Experimental Farm, a
              biological field station of the University  of Virginia, and will be immersed
              in a community of 15 -20  graduate/post-doctoral researchers.  Field trips will
              focus on  issues related to conservation; a weekly seminar series at the  Farm
              will also add to the research experience. A bio-ethics  component is included
              in the program consisting of weekly  lectures/discussions lead by Mr. David
              Bosco, Instructor of  Philosophy and Religious Studies at James Madison
              University.   Faculty wages, 1/2 the cost of a small truck, and fees for 
              laboratory space/dorm rooms are being contributed as cost share  items.  ***
