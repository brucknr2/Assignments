Abstract    :
              Hoffstein       This award funds the work of Professor Jeffrey Hoffstein in the
              theory of  automorphic forms. Professor Hoffstein will study twists of forms. 
              These ideas  promise a new approaches to several open problems in classical
              analytic number  theory.       This research falls under the general heading of
              Number Theory. Number Theory  is the study of the properties of the whole
              numbers and is the oldest branch of  mathematics. From the beginning problems
              in number theory have furnished the driving  force to creation of new
              mathematics in almost all parts of the discipline. One of the  philosophies of
              modern number theory is that many facts about numbers can be studied  using
              calculus.  This approach is very evident in the theory of automorphic forms. 
              This  kind of number theory is very technical and deep, but it has had
              astonishing  applications in areas like theoretical computer science and coding
              theory. ***
