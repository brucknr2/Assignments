              PROPOSAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS    Proposal Number:  CTS-9322657  P.I.:  R.C.
              Alkire et al  Institution:  Univ. of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign  Context:
              (within which proposal was reviewed)     Sixteen proposals were received and
              reviewed in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program (AMPP) by the
              Interfacial Transport and Separation Processes (ITSP) Program.  All 16
              proposals were sent out for mail review.  This proposal had reviewers suggested
              by the following programs or division; ITSP Chemical Reaction Processes,
              Chemistry Division and Solid-State Chemistry and Polymers.  The 16 proposals
              were then reviewed by a panel of five experts who met at NSF on May 4, 1994. 
              the panelists were given the mail reviews to consider together with their own
              individual reviews.  They were asked to rank-order the proposals and place them
              in one of three groups:    Highly Recommended    Recommended (if funds are
              available)    Not Recommended (not rank-ordered)    Analysis:         This
              proposal was placed in the Highly Recommended category (top three proposals). 
              A grant is highly recommended at a reduced level based upon comments from the
              reviewers and panelists.  The following programs have agreed to co-fund this
              proposal: ITSP, Chemical Reaction Process, and Solid-State Chemistry and
              Polymers.    CTS-9322657  Alkire et al, University of Illinois,
