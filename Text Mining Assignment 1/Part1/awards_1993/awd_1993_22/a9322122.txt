Abstract    :
              9322122  de Pater         Dr. de Pater will conduct a world-wide observing
              campaign at  centimeter wavelengths when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 passes through 
              Jupiter's magnetosphere and into its atmosphere.  The passage of  the cometary
              fragments and dust particles through the magnetosphere  followed by a series of
              impacts into the planet's atmosphere are  expected to cause dramatic changes in
              Jupiter's synchrotron  radiation that will yield new information on
              magnetosphere  processes.  ***
