Abstract    :
              Barton  9322840       The award is for research involving the use of
              multivariate  process measurements to identify most likely causes of variations
               in product characteristics by linking symmetry patterns in the  multivariate
              data with symmetry patterns associated with certain  kinds of production
              problems.  Process measurement vectors will be  represented using a process
              oriented basis that would be developed  by process engineers.  The
              representation of multivariate bias will  identify a small set of potential
              causes.       The basis developed during this research can also be used to 
              assess impact of changes in process control variables.  Such  information may
              be useful in real-time feedforward correction of  production problems in
              multi-stage production lines.  Such a  development would complement current
              efforts to combine process  monitoring and automatic control.
