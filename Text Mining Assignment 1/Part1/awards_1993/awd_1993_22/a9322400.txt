Abstract    :
              This research project approaches the general nonlinear programming  problem
              through the use of a hybrid systems based on genetic  algorithms.  The systems,
              in which genetic operators may vary with  the type of problem, is designed to
              handel both continuous and  discrete objective functions and both linear and
              non linear  constraints on continuous, integer, and Boolean variables.  The 
              approach is experimental, based on the design, implementation, and  evaluation
              of promising approaches, building on the investigator's  previous work in
              genetic algorithms.  An underlying objective of  the project is to develop
              theoretical foundations for continuous  genetic algorithms, and results of the
              research should also provide  a better understanding of the principles of
              genetic algorithms  applicability to constrained problems.
