Abstract    :
              9322049  Shuler  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project at the
              School  of Chemical Engineering at Cornell University will involve students  in
              such diverse areas as biotechnology, materials processing,  energy
              conservation, and environmental management.   The  undergraduate experience
              will emphasize intellectual independence,  initiative, the ability to work in
              teams, and effective  communication skills, attributes that are difficult to
              teach in  formal classroom instruction alone.  ***
