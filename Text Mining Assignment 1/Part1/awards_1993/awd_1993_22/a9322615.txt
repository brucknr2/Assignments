Abstract    :
              Pruess         The investigator develops and analyzes stable methods for 
              generating approximants of high global accuracy to functions  defined
              essentially by highly accurate interpolatory data.  Several  numerical
              algorithms for estimating the solution of an ordinary  differential equation
              can produce highly accurate approximations  at a finite set of points.  It is
              often desirable to construct a  closed form approximation based on this data;
              however, the obvious  piecewise polynomial interpolants frequently do not work,
               especially for highly nonuniform meshes.  An interpolant based on  local
              collocation seems to be stable but further analysis and  algorithms are needed.
               A related problem is that of finding  interpolants given accurate discrete
              data for Sturm-Liouville  eigenfunctions: it is desirable to retain the
              accuracy with an  interpolant having the correct oscillation properties.      
              The problems to be studied are a natural outgrowth of prior  work that resulted
              in a widely used software package.  Advances in  both theory and computer
              implementation are sought.  Applications  are to representation of curves
              arising in computer graphics, and  to producing graphical representations for
              solutions to problems  arising in quantum chemistry and physics.
