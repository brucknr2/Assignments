Abstract    :
              9322829  Gleaves    The objective of this work is a dynamic model of alkane
              oxidation  over vanadium-phosphorus-oxide (VPO) catalysts (also called vanadyl 
              pyrophosphate catalysts) that explains how such components of the  catalytic
              system as the VPO lattice, the VPO surface, surface  adspecies, and gas-phase
              species interact to give products with or  without selectivity.  The model
              would include the mechanism of  carbon-hydrogen bond activation and of oxygen
              addition, the  mechanism of oxygen transport, and the roles of adspecies in 
              determining selectivity.  To this end, the dynamics of the partial  oxidation
              of alkanes catalyzed by VPO are studied using a  combination of transient
              response and in situ spectroscopic  techniques.  A TAP (temporal analysis of
              products) reactor is  specially modified to permit simultaneous product
              analysis and in  situ infrared or Raman spectroscopy.     The selective
              conversion of light alkanes to oxygenates (alcohols,  ethers, aldehydes,
              esters, etc.) is of great interest to the  petrochemical and energy industries.
               Oxygenates are intermediates  for production of a large array of chemicals,
              polymers, and  plastics, and are also in great demand as gasoline additives,
              both  to improve octane rating and to reduce tailpipe pollutants.  They  are
              often produced using VPO catalysts, usually from an olefin  feedstock. 
              However, alkanes (paraffins) are a cheaper raw material  if the technology for
              their partial oxidation could be improved.   ***
