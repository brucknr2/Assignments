Abstract    :
                  The award provides funds to establish a National Science Foundation
              "Research  Experiences for Undergraduate" site in southeast Wisconsin.  Eight
              highly qualified  undergraduates will be recruited to conduct research, at the
              Biomedical Research  Institute laboratories on the campus of the University of
              Wisconsin-Parkside in Kenosha.  Based upon extensive experiences with
              undergraduate research together with active  research programs, faculty
              representing the focus of Molecular and Regulatory Biology  will serve as
              potential project supervisors.  This program is designed to develop each 
              participant's intellectual confidence, technical competence and research
              independence via    1.   Guidance and daily nurturing by active researchers in
              the areas of Molecular and       Regulatory Biology whose primary emphasis is
              working with undergraduates.  2.   A program of specific goals for each
              student's research progress via a meeting and       seminar schedule plus
              instruction in literature search and seminar presentation       techniques
              complementary to each project including faculty-led discussions of      
              relevant, current literature.  3.   Leveraging of the NSF effort through a
              commitment to support additional       students each summer and/or to carry
              over meritorious students for a second       summer of research using internal
              funding.  4.   Aggressive regional and in some cases national recruitment of
              superior candidates       with special efforts to attract underrepresented
              groups plus housing arrangements       proximate to the UWP laboratories, and, 
               5.   Immediate and long-term evaluation of the NSF-REU experience.
