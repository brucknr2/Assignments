Abstract    :
              9322808  Cetinkunt       The award is for research aimed at improving the
              accuracy of  low speed motion in ultra-precision machine tools by improving 
              control algorithms.  The control algorithm is based on the  cerebellar model
              articulation controller architecture and is  expected to learn machine
              characteristics such as friction and  backlash, which have a significant effect
              on machine accuracy at  the low speeds.  Nanometer level positioning accuracy
              is sought.   Experimental work will be conducted at the National Institute of 
              Standards and Technology and at the grantee institution on a single  point
              diamond turning machine.       Ultra-precision machining is needed for
              components such as  metallic and non-metallic mirrors for high power laser
              focusing,  mirrors for compact discs and video-cassette recorders, molds for 
              aspherical lenses, and planarization of silicon wafers.   Achievement of the
              motion accuracies sought here would therefore  have a beneficial impact on
              these manufacturing applications.
