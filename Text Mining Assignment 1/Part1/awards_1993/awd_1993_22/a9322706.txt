Abstract    :
              9322706  Covington  This research has two primary objectives: (1) to determine
              changes in selected ecosystem characteristics of a southwestern ponderosa
              pine/bunchgrass ecosystem  since Euro-American settlement, and (2) to determine
              changes in these same characteristics after two restoration treatments. Trees,
              shrubs, herbaceous vegetation, coarse woody debris and forest floor will be
              mapped on plots in two study areas. These data will be used in conjunction with
              dendroecological analysis and ecological simulation to estimate post-settlement
              changes in aboveground biomass, primary production, decomposition, microbial
              functional groups, nutrient cycling characteristics, and old growth tree
              physiology and susceptibility to insect attacks. Experimental treatments
              include (1) Control, (2) complete restoration (thin postsettlement trees,
              remove forest floor, burn at natural burning intervals), and (3) partial
              restoration (thin postsettlement trees). Previous research has shown that
              introducing fire without first removing forest floor materials results in death
              of overstory trees and damage to belowground systems.   %%%  This research will
              further our understanding of the role of fire in ecosystem restoration in
              southwestern forest systems. In addition to clear management implications, this
              research will enhance our understanding of the interaction of net primary
              production, fire, decomposition, microbial functional groups, and nutrient
              cycling in controlling ecosystem structure and function, and enhance knowledge
              of the role of natural disturbance regimes in forest ecosystems.  ***
