Abstract    :
              9322073  Becker       The existing REU Site in the Physics Department of San
              Jose  State University will be expanded to include the other active  research
              areas in the SJSU Physics Department.  A proposed new  and innovative component
              of this REU Site will include support  for students in industry-university
              collaborations.  Four teams  will be formed, each consisting of a Physics
              faculty member, a  physicist from an industrial or government laboratory
              located  close to the campus, and an NSF-REU student participant.  Although
              eleven of these projects are still in the area of  optics, the remaining two
              are in condensed matter and  computational physics.  All these projects
              complement the Physics  Department's officially recognized "Concentration in
              Lasers and  Optics", "Concentration in Condensed Matter", and the 
              "Concentration in Computational Physics".  These three areas  represent the
              major scientific focus in the high-tech "Silicon  Valley" surrounding our
              University.  These on-going research  projects will provide both experimental
              and theoretical research  experience for undergraduates in Physics.      
              Undergraduate students will be placed in thirteen projects  which range from
              experimental diode laser spectroscopy of stable  isotopes in carbon dioxide to
              theoretical studies of electrical  and optical properties of quantum well
              semiconductors, to rare-  earth spectroscopy, to temperature-induced refractive
              index  changes in oxide insulators, to neutron activation analysis of  optical
              materials.       The proposed program's major goal is to involve  undergraduate
              students, especially minorities, in research who  might not otherwise have the
              opportunity.  ***
