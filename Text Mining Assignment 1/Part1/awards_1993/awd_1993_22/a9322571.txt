Abstract    :
              9322571  Huband  This proposal is being awarded  to enable a task force of 
              engineering deans and industry leaders under the auspices of  the American
              Society for Engineering Education's (ASEE)  Engineering Deans Council and the
              ASEE Corporate Roundtable,  to conduct studies on the quality of engineering
              education.  The task group will undertake a study of the health of  engineering
               education in the United States and create  partnerships between universities
              and industry that can  strengthen the entire engineering enterprise.  This
              study  will begin with a planning meeting sponsored by the ASEE  Engineering
              Deans Council in the Fall, 1993 and continue  with a Spring, 1994 workshop.  An
              action team will then  focus on the results of the workshop for summer, 1994 
              implementation start date.  The results of the study will be  summarized by the
              action team and published in report form.  The report will be distributed
              widely in the governmental,  industrial and engineering communities.  ***
