Abstract    :
              9322078  Cravens         Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 is expected to enter the
              atmosphere of  Jupiter on about July 21-23, 1994.  Significant amounts of water
               vapor will be injected into the upper atmosphere of Jupiter.  The 
              photochemistry of both the neutral gas and the ionosphere will be  greatly
              altered by the influx of this water vapor or the atomic  oxygen generated by
              the dissociation of the water.  The odd oxygen  (i.e., oxygen or water vapor or
              the hydroxyl radical) associated  with the cometary water influx alters the ion
              chemistry by removing  ionized hydrogen ions, which also has the effect of
              reducing the  ionospheric electron density because ionized hydrogen is
              ordinarily  the main ion species in the Jovian ionosphere.  The oxygen atoms 
              from the dissociation of the cometary water will also react with  the methyl
              radical and eventually form carbon monoxide deeper in  the atmosphere.  The PI
              has a numerical model that was originally  developed to study the effects of
              odd oxygen on the auroral  ionosphere of Jupiter.  He proposes to adapt this
              model to study  the effects of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on the thermosphere and 
              ionosphere of Jupiter.  These effects (e.g., severe reduction of  electron
              density) will be both global and significant even a couple  of years after the
              comet impact which will allow the Galileo  spacecraft to study the recovery
              from this event.  ***
