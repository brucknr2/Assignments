Abstract    :
              This award supports research on free resolutions in commutative algebra.  The
              principal investigator will study a conjecture of Vasconcelos, the Poincare
              series and asymptotic behavior of betti numbers of modules over rings with
              small linking number, higher order multiplication in Tor-algebras, and the
              cokernel of generic exterior multiplication.             This research is
              concerned with a number of questions in commutative algebra and algebraic
              geometry.  Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families of polynomial
              equations.  One can either study the geometry of the solution set or approach
              problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the solution set
              that form what is called a commutative ring.  This dual perspective creates a
              close connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
