Abstract    :
              9322818  Lawson         The objective of this (Phase II) research is to design,
              build  and test an airborne digital holographic instrument for imaging  cloud
              drops and ice crystals.  This technique will provide an  explicit measurement
              of liquid water in clouds, as well as the size  and shape of small ice
              crystals, which are needed to determine the  optical properties of cirrus
              clouds.  ***
