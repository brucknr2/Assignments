Abstract    :
              9322370  Myers  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will
              continue  the cooperative effort between the National Solar Observatory at 
              Sunspot, New Mexico and The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP),  located in
              El Paso, Texas.  Student participants will be selected  from juniors and
              seniors majoring in Electrical Engineering,  Computer Engineering or Computer
              Science at UTEP.  The participants  will be involved in electronic and computer
              related research  support projects suggested by either the permanent staff or 
              visiting scientists at the National Solar Observatory.  The  projects will
              address practical problems that can be completed  within a summer with some
              limited follow-up in the subsequent Fall  Semester.  ***
