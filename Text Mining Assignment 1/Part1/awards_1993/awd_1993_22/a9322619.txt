Abstract    :
              9322619  Uhlmann       This award supports a continuation of mathematical
              research  on problems arising in electrical impedance tomography.   In 
              particular, work will be done extending known results in the  isotropic case to
              the physical case of non-smooth conductivities,  to characterize, in two
              dimensions, all the possible outcomes of  the experiments performed at the
              boundary and to consider the  identifiability problem for anisotropic
              conductivities in  dimensions three or greater.  The project furthers work on
              other  inverse boundary value problems arising in applications.   They include
              the question of determining the Lame parameters of  a medium by making
              measurements of displacements and stresses  at the boundary and the problems of
              determining the magnetic  and electric potentials of a body by making
              measurements at  the boundary.  Plans to consider two formally determined 
              inverse problems which involve scattering observations will also  be carried
              out.  One is the inverse scattering problem at a  fixed energy in two
              dimensions; the other is the inverse  backscattering problem for singular
              potentials.  Finally, work  will be done on the admissibility problem in
              tomography, i.e.  determining families of k-planes on which the k-plane
              transform  is injective. It is planned to find relative inversion formulas 
              (modulo smoothing) in such cases.       This work falls within the general area
              of research on  nonlinear partial differential equations and inverse problems. 
               The questions often lie close to physical applications arising  from diverse
              areas as tomography, conductivity and scattering.   That is, to find
              characteristics of some unknown by observing  the effect of some physical
              process which involves the unknown.  ***
