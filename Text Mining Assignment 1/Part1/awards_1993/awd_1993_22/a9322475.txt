Abstract    :
              9322475  Goodman       The investigator and Richard Pollack (Courant Institute
              of  the Mathematical Sciences, NYU) will continue their study of the  interplay
              between the geometry and the topology of Euclidean  spaces by extending their
              recent results (1) on a generalization  to Grassmann manifolds of the standard
              convexity structure of  Euclidean spaces, (2) on the classification of ordered 
              configurations and their generalizations, and (3) on related  geometric and
              combinatorial problems.  Building on their past  work on allowable sequences
              and order types of configurations, as  well as on ideas coming out of their
              solution of the Vincensini  problem for hyperplane transversals to families of
              convex bodies  and their recent extension of convexity to Grassmann manifolds, 
              Goodman and Pollack plan to continue their work on  configurations,
              arrangements of flats, and geometric transversal  theory.       One of the most
              elegant things that Goodman and Pollack have  done recently is to extend
              convexity, as noted above, from sets  of points in Euclidean spaces to sets of
              higher dimensional  flats, for example lines in ordinary three-space.  One
              obtains in  this way "convex" sets of lines such as all the lines through a 
              particular point, or all the lines in a particular plane, and  there is nothing
              especially exciting about these.  However, one  also obtains such sets as all
              the lines which are surrounded by a  particular hyperboloid of one sheet
              together with one set of  rulings lying on the surface of the hyperboloid. 
              Since the  suggestive formalism of convexity theory becomes available in  this
              new and broader context, it leads to some surprising new  geometric
              conjectures, proofs, and theorems.  ***
