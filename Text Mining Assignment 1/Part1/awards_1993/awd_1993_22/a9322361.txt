Abstract    :
              9322361  Ataai  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project in the 
              Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh  will
              introduce undergraduates from engineering and the sciences,  especially
              undergraduates majoring in chemical engineering,  chemistry, and biology at
              small colleges and universities in the  region, to a research environment in
              which full-time faculty,  visiting scientists, post-docs, and graduates
              students are working  on research that promises to lead to important new
              technologies in  the fields such as biochemical engineering, catalysis, and
              fuels.  ***
