Abstract    :
              9322353  Kuo    Nickel-base superalloys are critical materials to our aerospace 
              industry and to some areas of our energy industry.  Single crystals  of
              nickel-base superalloys have demonstrated excellent performance  in
              high-temperature gas turbines.  This grant supports a  university-industry
              collaboration on the growth of shaped single   crystals of nickel-base
              superalloys by pulling from liquid melts.   Single crystals are grown at the
              University of Wisconsin and tested  at Howmet Corporation, a major producer of
              single crystals of  nickel-base superalloys for high-temperature gas turbines
              in the  U.S.  The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of growing 
              low-cost, high-quality single crystals of constant cross-sections  (rods, bars,
              sheets and tubes).  These crystals are useful for  applications where
              complicated shapes are not required, e.g.,  single crystal sheets for turbine
              engine combustor liners (where  gas mixtures ignite).  An advantage is that
              numerous steps involved  in the preparation and removal of ceramic shell molds
              are not  required and the crystals are not limited to relatively short 
              lengths, unlike conventional crystal growth of nickel-base  superalloys by
              investment casting.  Attention is focused on growth  of single crystal sheets
              up to 2 feet long.  An improved technique  for pulling shaped crystals,
              recently developed at the University  of Wisconsin's crystal growth laboratory,
              is used and heat treating  and preliminary screening tests of the single
              crystals are  conducted by Howmet.    %%%  A videotape movie showing the
              results of the proposed work will be  made and copies distributed to the
              superalloy industry.  It will  also be used in two undergraduate materials
              processing courses at  the University of Wisconsin.  ***
