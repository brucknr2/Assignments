Abstract    :
              ***  9322792  Lally      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop new structural-acoustic sensors and improved control
              strategies which will result in active control systems which are more
              efficient, have greater reliability, better global noise reduction capability
              and are less costly than present systems.  While the past two decades have seen
              striking progress in active control technology, commercialization of active
              systems has been hindered by the performance of  the "working end" of the
              active system: the sensors and actuators. This research will develop, test and
              demonstrate an acoustic intensity sensor and acoustic impedance probe in an
              active panel.   The key to the anticipated advancements is the ability of these
              new sensors to obtain real-time measurements of structurally-radiated sound
              power. To facilitate communication of sensor arrays and improve system
              reliability, smart electronics will be developed and incorporated into the
              sensors as an IC micro-chip.  Automobiles, trucks and aircraft which
              incorporate such active control systems can be quieter, lighter and more fuel
              efficient than today's vehicles. The sensors also have important applications
              in engineering test laboratories. Used as a design tool, the sensor
              measurements will enable engineers to design quieter automobiles, appliances,
              fans, compressors, air conditioners and other machinery.  Architects can use
              the design technology to improve the acoustics of concert halls, lecture halls,
              meeting rooms and auditoriums.  ***
