Abstract    :
              9322045  Zielinski  This award supports participation by a US research team from
              the University of New  Hampshire in an international collaborative effort to
              collect and study an  approximately 500 meter long ice core from the Penny Ice
              Cap on Baffin Island,  Canada.  This project is collaborative with the
              Geological Survey of Canada and  Japan s National Institute of Polar Research. 
              Field work includes study of snow pits  and shallow cores in addition to
              collection and analysis of the main 500 meter long  core.  Laboratory work
              supported by this award includes analysis of major ions  (sodium, ammonium,
              potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, nitrate, and sulfate),  insoluble
              microparticles and methanesulfonic acid.  These data will be integrated with 
              analytical data collected in Canada and Japan and the complete set of analyses
              will be  used to construct a proxy record of climate and environmental
              conditions for Baffin  Island for the Holocene.  These data from the Penny Ice
              Cap will complement records  from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP):
              specifically, these data will provide  information about climatic conditions at
              lower elevations that will allow a useful  comparison to interpretations from
              the GISP cores.  ***
