Abstract    :
                9322786  Gordon  The overall objective of the Phase II Oasis program is to
              design , fabricate and test an underwater ambient noise sensor with an ADCP. 
              Such a system would be capable of inferring wind speed, rainfall parameters,
              and wind direction better than either system alone.  Synchronization is easily
              accomplished because the ADCP  CPU will be controlling both insturments.  Phase
              I  results indicate the feasibility of computing wind speed, and utimately
              rainfall parameters, from the ambient noise spectra.  Analysis of several data
              sets indicates that a modified algorithm using the shear of near surface bins
              from the ADCP is very, well correlated with wind direction, even in locations
              with high surface currents.  Additionally, the ADCP can infer near surface
              bubble concentrations which have a direct bearing on the attenuatuon of the
              higher frency ambient sound levels.
