Abstract    :
              This proposal pertains to the development of a prototype sub-nanosecond
              resolution optical sensor utilizing Pseudo-Random  Modulation (PRM) Correlation
              technique for time resolved fluorescence or photon migration measurements.  The
              results of the Phase I proof-of-concept experiment and accompanying simulation
              studies clearly demonstrated the powerful capabilities of the technique for
              time resolved measurements.  The validity of the Time Resolution Enhancement
              Technique was verified in both fluorescence and photon migration experiments. 
              In addition, a new method for correcting waveform deformation due to the signal
              droop, is developed by using an ad-hoc reference code which is simply the
              measured pump source waveform.  Combining the powerful PRM-Correlation method
              with the ad-hoc reference code and the Resolution Enhancement Technique, a
              simple, cost effective fluorosensor with sub-nanosecond time resolution is now
              conceptualized.  In Phase II, a prototype sensor for photon migration
              measurement with 50 psec resolution will be developed, and the system will be
              tested for the measurement of time resolved reflectance from a simulated tissue
              sample to retrieve the relevant parameters of the sample.  In addition,
              research for development of viable blue laser sources for PRM-Correlation
              fluorosensor will also be performed.
