Abstract    :
              9322011  Terzian    Cornell University will continue the Observational Astronomy
               program established in Summer 1989, and further developed from  1990, in which
              undergraduate students are involved in the research  activities of the
              astronomy group at Cornell University.  The  undergraduate students will work
              with members of the Cornell  faculty/radar astronomy, and other related topics.
               The students'  research at Cornell will also provide them the opportunity to 
              participate in astronomical observations at a facility used by  Cornell
              researchers.  The students will also be encouraged to  participate in the
              Undergraduate Research Forum, which is held  annually at Cornell University, to
              present and discuss their  various research projects with other students.  The
              Undergraduate  Research in Observational Astronomy program will encourage 
              participation by students who are women and minorities and whose  own
              institutions do not provide this kind of research experience  for their own
              undergradautes.
