Abstract    :
              9322240  Kassab   The 9th International Conference on Boundary Element
              Technology (BETECH 94) will be hosted by the University of Central Florida in
              Orlando, Florida during March 16-18, 1994.  The Boundary Element Method (BEM)
              has now reached a stage in its development where it is no longer purely a
              research tool used by academics but a viable analytical technique for
              engineering analysis and design.  Indeed, the BEM is making inroads with
              industrial users.  There exists a need for an international forum for
              researchers to exchange ideas and expose industrial users to their developments
              and conversely for industrial users to expose researchers to novel issues
              arising form their experience in using the BEM.   The ninth Boundary Element
              Technology Conference to be held in Orlando will provide a forum for the
              exchange of ideas between, industrial users, boundary element researchers, and
              commercial and research code developers.  It is co-organized by the Wessex
              Institute of Technology which is part of the Florida State University System. 
              There is much local industrial interest in the BEM as is evidenced by the
              letters provided by the industrial members of the Local Organizing Committee. 
              Further, the Florida Section of the ASME has sponsored the conference and will
              be instrumental in publicizing and supporting the Conference.  The
              International Society for Boundary Elements (ISBE) will sponsor the Conference
              and will publicize it in its newsletter.  The Proceedings of the Conference
              will be published by Computational Mechanics and Elsevier Press, will be
              distributed to all delegates, and will serve as an important source of
              reference in the applications of the BEM. The proceeding will be disseminated
              worldwide by the publishers.  ***
