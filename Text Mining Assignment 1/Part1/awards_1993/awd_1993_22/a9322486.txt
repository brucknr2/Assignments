Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-22486    This award provides funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V WECOMA, a 177 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and
              operated by Oregon State University.  Instrumentation requested includes
              upgrades for the computer network aboard the ship, a towing sheave for the
              SeaSoar, a dissolved oxygen titration system, and upgrades to the rosette
              package.  The instrumentation is requested for support of NSF-funded cruises
              aboard the WECOMA during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the
              vessel in the future.
