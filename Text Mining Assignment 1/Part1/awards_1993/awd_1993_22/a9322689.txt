Abstract    :
              Bass       Professors Bass and Burdzy propose to study some problems in  the
              areas: boundary behavior of Brownian motion and harmonic  functions, reflecting
              Brownian motion, diffusions on fractals,  occupation times for random walks in
              two dimensions, exceptional  points of planar Brownian motion, intersection
              local times for  planar Brownian motion, iterated Brownian motion, and
              numerical  results for Fleming--Viot processes.       Brownian motion as
              studied in probability theory is a  mathematical model of what one sees when
              one watches how cream  gets mixed into coffee or how smoke diffuses through the
              air of a  room. It is not surprising that the study of Brownian motion has 
              applications to physics, chemistry, engineering, and quantum  mechanics;
              however, it is also extremely useful for filtering  noisy signals, studying the
              growth of populations, the behavior  of the stock market, and a whole host of
              other applications.  Professors Bass and Burdzy propose to study how Brownian
              motion  and related objects can be used in solving problems that come up  in
              mathematical physics. Many of these problems can be reduced to  the solution of
              certain partial differential equations, which in  turn can be resolved through
              the use of Brownian motion and other  diffusions.
