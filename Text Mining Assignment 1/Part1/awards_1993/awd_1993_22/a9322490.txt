Abstract    :
              9322490  Grimes  University of Virginia  Dr. Russell N. Grimes, Chemistry
              Department, University of Virginia, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for  the planned synthesis
              and study of selected families of structurally novel organometallic complexes
              which are stabilized by small carborane ligands. The research is divided into
              two general sections. The first is the development of new synthons from which
              carborane-based transition metal sandwich complexes can be assembled into
              extended multi-decker sandwich compounds and polymers. The second area is the
              development of small carboranes and early transition-metal complexes derived
              from them as stoichiometric reagents for organometallic reactions and as
              catalysts for ring-opening and Ziegler-Natta polymerization. In each of these
              studies air stable systems will be sought.  Polymers which incorporate
              multimetallic monomers with unique properties have the potential of providing
              new electronic materials. To produce new materials whose electronic and
              magnetic properties can be tailored, air-stable polymers in which small units,
              consisting of a few metals sandwiched between rings of boron and carbon atoms,
              will linked into a variety of extended structures. A selection of the compounds
              will also be developed as air-stable catalysts for industrially important
              polymerization processes.
