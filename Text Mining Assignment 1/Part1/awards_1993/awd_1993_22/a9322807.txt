Abstract    :
              9322807  Kazerooni       This research investigates the use of extenders to
              support  material handling functions in situations where weight lifting by 
              workers is involved.  Extenders are computer-controlled material  handling
              device that are worn by workers to maneuver loads in work  places to minimize
              the weight intensity and exaction level felt by  the worker.  It is
              hypothesized that these devices, when worn by  workers to maneuver loads, do
              prevent back injuries.  The research  includes the analysis of maneuvers needed
              to lift, move, and  transfer loads, quantify the performance of extenders in
              terms of  workers, physiological characteristics, design a lightweight 
              electromagnetic actuator that behaves like Hill's model of  extenders, and
              develop adaptive control rules which will prevent  human induced instability in
              the presence of variation in human arm  dynamics.         This research focuses
              on providing a solution to a real and  practical problem that is felt in
              various sectors of our economy.   If the research goals are realized, the
              outcome will have a  significant impact on cost savings, especially in those
              industrial  segments of the economy in which significant weight lifting by 
              workers is involved.  Annual cost and losses in productivity due to  back
              injury cases in industry is staggering.  This research does  offer some
              potential to minimize these losses and improve  employees' working conditions
              and morale.
