Abstract    :
              9322778  Warner    This two-year award supports U.S.-Belgium-Italy cooperative 
              research in fish ecology and fisheries. Researchers from the  University of
              California, Santa Barbara (Robert A. Warner),  University of Liege (Pierre
              Lejeune), and University of Padova  (Andrea Marconato) will conduct a
              comparative study of  fertilization rates of benthically spawning nearshore
              fish.  Using a series of benthically spawning wrasses available only in  the
              Mediterranean, the investigators will study the fertilization  rates and sperm
              release.  They will then conduct field  experiments to demonstrate the
              relationship between spawning  rate, sperm allocation, and the demands of male
              defense.     The project takes advantage of facilities at the European marine 
              station for underwater and oceanographic research in Corsica,  France.  It
              brings together U.S.-Belgium and Italian expertise  and experience on an
              important economic topic.  Fisheries  worldwide depend on accurate estimates of
              fish fecundity and  production.  This study advances understanding of the 
              fertilization process and factors related to increased  production.  This
              information eventually will be applied by  fisheries in order to increase
              production.  ***
