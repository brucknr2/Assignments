Abstract    :
              9322523  George  An engaging research experience is an effective method to
              attract and retain talented undergraduate students for careers in science and
              engineering. This project will provide an environment for minority
              undergraduate students to experience research in Applied Computer Science.
              Students will be recruited from institutions that lack graduate programs in
              Computer Science.     The two major components of the project are a summer
              research project and a one day seminar during the following academic year.
              During the summer, the participants will engage in well-defined, ongoing
              research projects. By working in small groups, they will have the opportunity
              to interact closely with experienced faculty researchers and graduate students.
              The participants will be encouraged to continue their studies and pursue
              research careers in Computer Science. Each group will write a research paper
              describing the work completed during the summer research project. These papers
              will be presented in a seminar during the following academic year.   u
