Abstract    :
              9322798  Olejniczak  This project will investigate new harmonic signal models
              and  state estimators for electric power quality analysis and  assessment. 
              Using state-variable techniques, harmonic signal  models will be investigated
              to represent the stochastic  variations in the amplitude, phase, and radian
              frequency of  harmonic components in signals corrupted by noise.  Nonlinear 
              stochastic state estimators to identify the harmonic components  of each
              measured signal for use in harmonic mitigation  methodologies will be
              constructed.  The new harmonic signal  models in conjunction with their
              respective estimator may be  applied to new flexible AC transmission systems
              (FACTS)  controllers (e.g., static condenser) which have the capability of 
              performing real-time harmonic filtering.  Also, it is conjectured  that the
              harmonic signal models created in this research project  may be used in
              electric power system simulation software packages  to more accurately
              represent field measurements and observed  phenomena in the distribution
              system.  ***
