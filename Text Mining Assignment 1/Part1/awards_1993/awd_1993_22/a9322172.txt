Abstract    :
              9322172  Annett  A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will be 
              continued in the physics department of The Pennsylvania State  University at
              the University Park campus during 1994-1997.  The  REU site will involve
              approximately 16 students in research  projects each summer.  Students will be
              involved in projects  covering a wide range of frontier research.  As an REU
              site, the Penn State physics department will mount an  aggressive campaign to
              recruit students into the program, with a  wide recruitment area covering
              Pennsylvania and surrounding, mid-  Atlantic region states.  Active efforts to
              encourage minority  student enrollment will include personal visits to targeted
              HBCU  physics departments at Morehouse, Clark-Atlanta and Cheyney, and  will
              make use of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC)  of the Big 10
              schools.  In addition to their own research projects, students will attend 
              special weekly seminars designed to broaden their knowledge of  physics and
              encourage interaction with faculty.  Throughout the  program, emphasis will be
              placed on encouraging the students'  interest in careers in physics.  ***
