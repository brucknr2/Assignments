Abstract    :
              9322141  WILLIAMS  This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences
              for  Undergraduate Site in Sociology at the University of Nebraska-  Lincoln. 
              The objective of the program is to provide a ten-week  high-quality research
              environment for students who are  underrepresented in science careers
              (minorities, women, and the  disabled) and/or have limited access to research
              facilities and  training at the schools they are attending.  Using the research
               facilities of the Bureau of Sociological Research and under the  close
              guidance of faculty supervisors, students will initiate and  carry out research
              projects from formulating a problem to writing  a final report.  Students will
              participate in morning seminars  where they will learn research methods and
              share their ongoing  research with each other.  Afternoons will be spent
              engaging in  individual projects and learning to use appropriate research 
              technologies.  The students' papers will be presented at the  Nebraska
              Undergraduate Symposium held each fall and submitted for  presentation at a
              professional meeting, such as the Midwest  Sociological Society and the
              Mid-South Sociological Society.      This award contributes to the Foundation's
              continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in science
              through active  undergraduate research experiences.  ***
