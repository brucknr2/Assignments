Abstract    :
                  9322244  JONES    This is a request to continue an REU SITE at the Bermuda 
              Biological Station for Research. This program provides a three  month intensive
              immersion in marine science research during the  fall (mid-September to
              mid-December). Some of the students will  be involved with projects related to
              the U.S.JGOFS (Joint Global  Ocean Flux Study), while others will focus on the
              links between  near shore processes and oceanic and atmospheric events. This 
              allows students to participate in large-scale interdisciplinary  research
              programs as they concentrate on the primary objective of  doing original
              scientific research.
