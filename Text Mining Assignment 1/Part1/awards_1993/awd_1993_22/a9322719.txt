Abstract    :
              9322719  Schiff  The Midwest floods of 1993 provide a unique opportunity to 
              evaluate the impact of lifeline disruption and identify  lifeline
              interdependencies.  The Central United States has  the potential of
              experiencing a catastrophic earthquake, as  demonstrated by the New Madrid
              Earthquakes of 1811 and 1812.  Recent experience in California and foreign
              earthquakes  demonstrates the vulnerability of lifelines.  In many  instances,
              lifeline disruption has a significantly negative  effect on the emergency
              response.  The floods have disrupted  the water and/or sewer systems in over
              300 communities,  disrupted barge and rail transportation shipments of coal to 
              electric power generating facilities, and flooded power  substations.  While
              flood damage to lifeline facilities is  likely to be different than that
              observed in earthquakes,  the extent of flooding and disruption provides an 
              opportunity to gain insight into the effects of lifeline  disruption from a
              large earthquake in the region.  Procedures used by lifeline organizations for
              working around  problems and hidden interdependencies of lifelines can also  be
              identified.  Three tasks will be performed in the conduct  of the research.  A)
              interviews will be conducted with  lifeline and emergency response
              organizations in Des Moines,  Iowa, B) special situations where disruption has
              had an  impact will be investigated, and C) a mail survey will be  conducted of
              flood impacted lifeline organizations to get a  broader assessment of the
              impact of lifeline disruption.  This study of lifelines is related to NSF's
              Civil  Infrastructure Systems Research initiative.  A complementary  project
              will be carried out by the Disaster Research Center  at the University of
              Delaware to evaluate the economic  consequences to business due to lifeline
              failures.  This  award is made under the Small Grants for Exploratory  Research
              program.  ***
