Abstract    :
              9322766  Forstneric           The research involves the geometry and dynamics of
               holomorphic vector fields in complex Euclidean space. Connected  with this are
              problems of convexity type which entail analysis on  the polynomial hull. The
              scope of projects has potential  applications to complex dynamical systems and
              the geometry of  partial differential equations. The overall area of several 
              complex variables in which the research falls, has long-standing  applications
              to elasticity theory and other areas of enginnering  science.  ***
