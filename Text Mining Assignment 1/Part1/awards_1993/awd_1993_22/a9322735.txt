Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-22735    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 120 foot vessel, which is owned and
              operated by the University.  Instrumentation requested includes computer
              hardware for the shipboard computer system, a profiling radiometer, electronic
              boards for the ADCP, and upgrades to the thermosalinograph.  The
              instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard
              the CAPE HENLOPEN during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the
              vessel in the future.
