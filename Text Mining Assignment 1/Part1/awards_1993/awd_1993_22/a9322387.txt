Abstract    :
              Paulay  9322387    The massive earthquake that shook the Pacific island of Guam 
              on August 8, 1993, offers an unprecedented opportunity for  studying the
              effects of tectonic forces on coral community  composition.  The great
              variation observed in damage  intensity among sites point to a variety of
              factors being  important in influencing the susceptibility of reefs to 
              earthquake damage.  In this study, scientists will describe  the effects of the
              earthquake on the reefs surrounding Guam,  and  evaluate how location, shelter,
              colony growth form, and  reef topography affected that severity of damage.  ***
