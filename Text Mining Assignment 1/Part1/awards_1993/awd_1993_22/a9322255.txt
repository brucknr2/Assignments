Abstract    :
              9322255  Sipcic  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will focus
              on  Simulation and Computational Modeling in Science and Engineering.   This
              research centers on the cutting-edge problems that challenge  engineers and
              scientists that typically cannot be solved by other  methods.  The Boston
              University Department of Aerospace and  Mechanical Engineering features active
              research groups in Acoustic  and Wave Propagation; Nonlinear Dynamics Chaos and
              Turbulence;  Control and Robotics; Fluid Dynamics and Transport Phenomena; and 
              Engineered Materials.  These research groups are supported by  
              state-of-the-art computational facilities.   ***
