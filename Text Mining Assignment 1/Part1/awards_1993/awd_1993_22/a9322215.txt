Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9322215  Emery     The proposal requests funds to support
              cooperative work between the University of Washington and the Moscow Aviation
              Institute.  The project will utilize the combined expertise of the two
              institutions to address problems involving optimal parameter estimation methods
              and optimal sensor location procedures for thermal and thermal-based structural
              problems.  The collaboration will combine the expertise of the Moscow Aviation
              Institute in deterministic one-dimensional inverse and sensitivity problems
              with that of the University of Washington in two-dimensional statistical
              sensitivity studies using finite element methods.
