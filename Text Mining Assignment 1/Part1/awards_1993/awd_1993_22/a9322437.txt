Abstract    :
              9322437  Collins    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for twelve 
              undergraduate students to gain research experience synthesis  and
              characterization techniques..  The students will be  participating in on-going
              research projects, including:  ionic exchange waveguides in soda-lime glass;
              manophase  clusters in insulator hosts by synthesizing and  characterizing the
              infrared reesponse and thermal properties  of dielectric materials confined to
              porous borosilicate  glass and alumina; crystal growth and characterization of 
              ternary telluride crystals; spectroscopic studies of glasses  for nonlinear
              optical applications; surface characterization  of modified surfaces of
              zinc-cadmium-telluride single  crystals using electron and ion-beam
              spectroscopies; and  photoconductivity studies of mercury iodide and lead
              iodide.      %%%      The goal of this program at Fisk University, a
              Historically  Black University, is to provide undergraduate students with  a
              successful research experience in on-going research  projects which will serve
              to teach students the scientific  approach to problem solving, as well as
              advanced methods of  materials synthesis and characterization, and motivate
              more  students to obtain professional/advanced degrees.  Increased 
              participation from other institutions will be emphasized and  where possible,
              students from different schools will be  paired together to foster a better
              learning environment.
