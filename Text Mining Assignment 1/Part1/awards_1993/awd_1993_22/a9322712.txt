Abstract    :
              9322712  Schruben       This research investigates the relationship between the 
                 different mathematical and graphical schemes used in representing   discrete
              event simulation.  The objective is to unify and simplify   these mathematical
              relationships for discrete event simulation.     The ultimate goal of the
              research is to develop explicit     mathematical representation of the dynamics
              of a discrete event     system with some practical utility and theoretical
              foundations     similar to that provided by differential equations in
              continuous    time simulation.       The outcome of this research will make it
              easier for users of   simulation to move between different models
              representations without  loss of the key elements of a model.  The ability to
              move between  different model representations is a significant research   
              contribution in simulation.  The impact is ease of modeling,     flexibility in
              system usage as users can easily move across     platforms, better modeling and
              modeling tools, and improved     analysis as the results from one model
              representation are compared   with those obtained under a different
              representation with the     objective of identifying any causes of
              discrepancies in results, if   any.
