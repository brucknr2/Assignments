Abstract    :
                   A newly constructed, pulsed-nozzle Fourier transform microwave 
              spectrometer will be used to determine the structures, dipole  moments, and
              reaction energetics of a variety of gaseous species  that are precursors to
              certain atmospheric aerosols and acids.   Particular emphasis will be placed on
              adducts of sulfur trioxide  (SO3), which is the immediate precursor to sulfuric
              acid (H2SO4) in  the atmosphere.  Additional studies will focus on complexes 
              involving water vapor, sulfur trioxide, ammonia, sulfur dioxide,  sulfuric
              acid, nitrogen oxides, and nitric acid.  The data from  these spectroscopic
              investigations will provide new molecular-level  detail about the chemical
              mechanisms that produce sulfuric acid and  nitric acid aerosols.  Because
              aerosols influence the earth's  albedo and precipitation patterns, this
              research will impact our  understanding of climate.         Many of the adducts
              targeted for study are expected to involve  bonding forces that are
              intermediate between van der Waals and  covalent.  Consequently, this research
              will explore the role of  unconventional bonding in complexes involved in
              postulated  processes of atmospheric importance.  Extensions of the initial 
              project will include studies of radical intermediates and selected  tertiary
              clusters that represent the next step beyond dimers in the  homogeneous
              nucleation process.
