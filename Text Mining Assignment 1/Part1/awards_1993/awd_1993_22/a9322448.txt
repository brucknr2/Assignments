Abstract    :
              9322488  Horanyi    The fragments of the recently discovered Comet
              Shoemaker-Levy  are expected to return to Jupiter on July 25, 1994.  During the
               approximately 1 week long trip, as Comet Shoemaker-Levy crosses  Jupiter's
              magnetosphere, it will produce more dust in situ than the  total mass of the
              main jovian ring (  5 x 1010 g).  Dust grains, once  exposed to the plasma
              environment, will collect electrostatic charges  and interact with the magnetic
              and electric fields of the  magnetosphere.  These grains will be dispersed or
              focused  depending on their size and location in the plasma environment. 
              Research on this award will allow extended computer simulations of  the
              trajectories of a large number of test particles accounting for all  the
              relevant interactions.  This test particle code has been developed  by the PI
              and has been successfully applied to charged dust  dynamics around other
              planets, and also in the Earth's  magnetosphere.  These same routines will be
              used for the case of  Comet Shoemaker-Levy entering Jupiter's magnetosphere. 
              It is  quite possible that new dust rings may be formed around Jupiter as  a
              result of this comet impact.
