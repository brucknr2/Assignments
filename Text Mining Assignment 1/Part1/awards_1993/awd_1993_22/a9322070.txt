Abstract    :
              9322070  Hatcher       This award provides support for a group of six
              undergraduate  researchers in the mathematical sciences working at Texas 
              Christian University.  Students will  work on individual research  projects
              applying computational group theoretic methods to  problems arising from
              variations of sliding block configurations.   Three faculty advisors will work
              with  students, who will be  divided into groups according to their interests. 
              Computers  using GAP software will be available for experimentation and 
              exploration.  Students will be expected to make oral  presentations and write
              up the results of their efforts at the  end of the program in the form of
              research papers.  They will be  encouraged to participate in professional
              meetings as well.         The program will run for a period of eight weeks.  
              Optional housing on campus is available.  Recruiting will be done  on a
              regional basis, with particular emphasis placed on alerting  students in
              underrepresented groups of the REU opportunity.  ***
