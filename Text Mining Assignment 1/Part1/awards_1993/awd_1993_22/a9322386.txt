Abstract    :
              9322386  Nigg  This award is made under the Small Grants for Exploratory 
              Research program to conduct a twelve-month study of the  economic consequences
              of flooding in the mid-central states  that occurred during the summer of 1993.
               The investigation  will focus on disruption of the economic sector of Des 
              Moines and Polk County, Iowa due to the multiple failure of  lifeline systems. 
              Greater Des Moines was selected for  intensive study because of the massive
              lifeline failures  across the community, a condition which is likely to reflect
               the conditions arising from a large earthquake in a  metropolitan area.    The
              project is related to NSF's Civil Infrastructure Systems  Research initiative. 
              By investigating multiple  infrastructural failures in one community due to a
              disaster,  we will gain a perspective on the relative importance of  these
              systems for the economic well-being of a community.  A  complementary project
              focusing on lifeline engineering will  be carried out by the Technical Council
              on Lifeline  Earthquake Engineering.  ***
