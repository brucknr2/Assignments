Abstract    :
              9322446  Chandrasekar      This Research Experiences for Undergraduates site is
              focused around the Colorado State University-CHILL facility.  Ten students
              (mostly at the end of junior year) will join research programs at the facility.
               Following the summer research program, the students will be prepared and
              supported adequately with research resources if they want to continue senior
              projects in their own institutions via computer access, data support and any
              other possible support that can be envisioned.  At the end of the project,
              students are required to write a formal report and to present their results in
              seminars.  ***
