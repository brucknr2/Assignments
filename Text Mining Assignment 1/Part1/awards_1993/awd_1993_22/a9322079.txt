              Merlic and other members of the Chemistry Department  of UCLA are being
              supported in a new Research Experiences for  Undergraduates site in Chemistry.
              For the period 1994-6, nine  undergraduates will spend ten weeks each summer
              actively engaged  in a variety of research projects. A unique feature of the 
              program will be the focus on bioorganic chemistry.
