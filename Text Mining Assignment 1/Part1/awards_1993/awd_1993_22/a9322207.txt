Abstract    :
              9322207  Blows       This award provides for a research environment for a group 
              of six undergraduate researchers in the mathematical sciences.   The project
              will run for a period of eight weeks. Students will  be recruited nationally
              and selected on the basis of mathematical  ability and background and the
              perceived benefits which will  result from the program.  Efforts will focus on
              attracting  applications from students in underrepresented groups.  Students 
              will be paired with faculty advisors to work on problems from  areas such as
              combinatorics, dynamical systems and  stochastic processes.  Each topic will
              focus on an unsolved  problem close to state-of-the-art research in the
              mathematical  sciences.  To foster the research environment, students will 
              participate in a seminar series and present their own results  both orally and
              in writing.  Healthy interaction among the  students will be an important goal
              of this activity.        Availability of university resources such as a 
              computer laboratory will add to the strength of the activity.   Students will
              have offices and computational facilities available  for the duration of the
              project.  ***
