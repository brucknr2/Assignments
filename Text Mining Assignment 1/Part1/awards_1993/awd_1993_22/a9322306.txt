Abstract    :
              9322306  Kennedy  This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project at the 
              Department of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University will  identify and
              encourage those students who have demonstrated the  interest and ability to
              make original contributions to the field of  mechanical engineering through
              research activities.  By introducing  these students to the opportunities that
              exist in both graduate  school and in an academic environment, it is hoped that
              a  significant number of the participants would elect to continue  their
              studies beyond the B.S. level.  ***
