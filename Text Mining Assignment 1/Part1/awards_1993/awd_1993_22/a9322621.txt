Abstract    :
              9322621  Basu    This SGER grant explores a method of processing (spray forming)
              to  create oxidation-resistant stainless steel alloys.  A fine grain  size is
              required, and this is accomplished by spray forming and  introduction of
              highly-stable precipitates of aluminum nitride and  titanium boride to resist
              grain growth.  The stainless steel  produced is expected to have superior high
              temperature oxidation  resistance due to its ability to form thin continuous
              silica layers  that act as diffusion barriers between the exterior chromia
              layer  and the bulk alloy.  %%%  This research could lead to the development of
              processing methods  to produce less expensive, highly oxidation-resistant
              stainless  steels that contain lower concentrations of chromium.   ***
