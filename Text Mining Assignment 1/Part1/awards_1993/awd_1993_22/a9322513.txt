Abstract    :
                The structure of feasible computations determines whether one   can
              efficiently solve the optimization problems  posed by nature and the   modern
              world.  The  long-term goal  of this research is to understand which  problems
              have  efficient solutions, via learning why certain problems may lack 
              computationally feasible algorithms.  Of particular  interest are the
              structural  relationships between complexity  classes, and the internal
              structure of  complexity classes.    Though the project intends to broadly
              investigate this  area,  focus will be given to the research via two themes: 
              (a) dealing with  unpredictable execution order; and (b) the properties of
              sparse sets.  On  the first topic, this  project investigates the class of
              languages computable via  a  large number of short subtasks, each of which is
              given the  (small) result of  the subtask that executed before it.  This  has
              been studied by Cai and Furst  and others for the case  where the scheduling of
              the subtasks is trivial and  fixed.  However, the project studies the case in
              which the order  in which  the subtasks execute is unpredictable.  On the
              second topic,   several issues dealing with sparse sets (which are a classic 
              examples of  `sets of low information content`) are examined.
