Abstract    :
              A physics research program for nine undergraduate students  is planned at
              University of California, Irvine each summer  for the next three years.  The
              program involves projects  with a variety of physics research groups under
              close  supervision by faculty and senior research staff.  Research 
              opportunities are offered in the areas of experimental  elementary particle
              physics, condensed matter, plasma  physics, and astrophysics.  Close contact
              between student  participants, encouraging the sharing of research  experiences
              in these varied areas, is promoted by providing  shared housing, and through
              social activities.  The research  experience is further enhanced through a
              seminar series,  visits to the labs of fellow participants, and excursions to 
              other research labs in the Los Angeles area.  The program is administered by
              the co-principal  investigator, a woman who has involved undergraduates 
              extensively in her own research leading to numerous papers  including
              undergraduate authors.  With the assistance of the  project PI, this
              administrator arranges publicity,  recruitment, orientation, seminars,
              excursions, a postsummer  follow-up program, and generally works to insure a
              valuable  research experience for students in the program.  ***
