Abstract    :
              9322040  Whitesell  Advances in high technology areas such as electrooptical 
              interfaces are currently limited by methods for fabrication and  processing of
              new materials.  For example, optical switches  require materials with alignment
              of the polar axis of the  composite molecules.  The synthesis of highly
              oriented materials  as thin films on surfaces using new synthetic methods and 
              techniques was recently reported.  These studies represent the  beginning of a
              major program leading to unique materials with  major practical applications. 
              In the area of alpha-amino acid  peptides there is a great potential for
              practical  applications of these materials in photostable, electrooptical 
              devices.  Furthermore, it is likely that a range of other  polymers can be
              fabricated in new forms as thin films on  surfaces.  Broadly stated, the goals
              of this program are:  1.  Fabrication:  to study in detail ways of preparing
              alpha-  amino acid peptides as ordered arrays on metal and non-metal  surfaces,
              including photolithographic techniques for the  construction of nanoscale
              structures; 2.  Physical  characterization:  to expand knowledge of the
              properties of these  peptide layers, especially as they relate to their
              unusual,  highly polar nature; 3.  Extensions:  to examine other polymer 
              systems for applicability to ordered growth on surfaces, with the  aim of
              preparing novel thin films heretofore never examined.  %%%  As a result of this
              research, methods of fabrication novel,  highly oriented thin films from
              alpha-amino acids will be  developed.  The films are promising candidates for
              the  construction of optical switches for the next generation of 
              electrooptical devices.
