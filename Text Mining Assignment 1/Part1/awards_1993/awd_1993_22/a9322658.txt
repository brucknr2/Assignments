Abstract    :
              9322658  Chelst          To excel in the first decades of the 21st century,  
              manufacturers must have a strategic and operational vision of   design,
              marketing, and distribution that encompasses the world.  To  implement this
              vision, a manufacturer must also effectively utilize  service systems in areas
              such as finance, human resource   management, information systems, and
              telecommunications to support   its global enterprise.  Operations research and
              management science   (OR/MS) are some of the tools modern managers use to
              address   complex strategic, tactical and operational concerns.  This project 
              is designed to increase the visibility and role of OR/MS techniques  in
              improving the global competitiveness of United States   manufacturers and their
              suppliers.       The theme of the Fall 1994 ORSA/TIMS conference is Global  
              Manufacturing in the 21st Century.  To insure the relevance of the   conference
              to practical problems, a major effort is planned to   increase the
              participation in the conference of OR/MS practitioners  and managers of
              manufacturing and related enterprises.  This will   include: 1) an expanded
              marketing effort, 2) a special program for   manufacturing managers with little
              or no OR/MS  background and 3)   complimentary registrations for a limited
              number of manufacturing   manager speakers who are not members of ORSA or TIMS.
               All of these  efforts should enhance the practical value of the conference to
              the  manufacturing and related service support sectors of the United   States
              economy.
