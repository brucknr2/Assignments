Abstract    :
              Project Summary  Damon/9322325         The proposed project will measure samples
              of the beryllium 10  pulses.  The investigators will also measure beryllium 10
              at a  geomagnetic excursion that has not yet been named.  Beryllium 10 
              concentrations are related to intensity of the geomagnetic field.   The large
              area and long residence time of the ocean tends to  integrate the effect of
              changes in the geomagnetic field on a  quasi-global scale while acting as a
              low-pass filter suppressing  the effect of century-scale changes in solar
              activity.  Thus,  measurements of beryllium 10 will be made in the outer Blake
              Ridge  core at regular intervals to evaluate changes in the geomagnetic  field
              intensity and establish the base level for the beryllium 10  production rate
              anomalies related to changes in the intensity of  the galactic cosmic-ray flux.
