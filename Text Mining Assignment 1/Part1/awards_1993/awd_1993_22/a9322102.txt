Abstract    :
               Almost all mathematical problems in science and   engineering are  approximated
              by linear and non-linear systems of integral   and/or  partial  differential
              equations, which vary widely in number,  form,   and character.  Since
              analytical solutions do not exist for  most problems of   interest,  numerical
              approximation techniques,  such as finite element   and finite  difference
              methods, are widely  used, ultimately resulting in   a system of linear  or
              non-linear  algebraic equations, which must then be   solved.  In the realistic
               representation of practical applications over large and/or    domains, such
              systems may contain m=104 to 107  unknowns.    For non-linear or  transient
              problems, the system  requires the repetitive   solution of  corresponding
              linearized  problems for changing parameters.    Direct solution  methods often
               cannot be used because of excessive storage   and time requirements  (the
              latter are O(m3)).  Iterative methods (such as   multigrid,  conjugate 
              gradients, SSOR, orthomin, and GMRES), which take time  O(m2)   per iteration,
              are  almost universally applied.  Another  candidate for solving   very large
              linear  systems is the Monte  Carlo method, which takes time O(m) per  
              iteration; but the  high  variances of the estimates and the very slow  
              convergence has  tended to  eliminate it from consideration.  The sequential
              Monte  Carlo   method is a  promising modification which shows guaranteed 
              convergence.    This method is  applied to broad classes of  large systems of
              linear and non-  linear equations.  Preliminary  computations show promisingly
              large improvements   in speed and  efficiency over both plain Monte Carlo and
              deterministic   methods.
