Abstract    :
              9322830  Hopp       The objective of this research work is to develop new 
              generation design tools for semiconductor fabrication facilities.   The
              research involves the use of recent results in queuing network  approximations
              and the extensions of already developed models.  The  research is targeted
              toward the development of design tools that  can produce an integrated
              logistics/economics analysis techniques  for improving existing designs and
              producing near optimal design  from scratch.  The research  result will be used
              to construct a  workable prototype design tool that will be linked to an
              industrial  equipment data base and tested in actual fabrication design 
              processes of a semi-conductor fabricator.       This research is well focused
              and very likely to result in a  product that has immediate industry
              application.  The problem  addressed is real and likely to have some lasting
              impact on  engineering infrastructure.  The outcome of this research, if 
              successfully accomplished, can lead to improved design of wafer  fabrication
              facilities and their operation.  The active support  given to this research by
              wafer fabrication companies is a strong  evidence of how the work is viewed by
              the target industry.
