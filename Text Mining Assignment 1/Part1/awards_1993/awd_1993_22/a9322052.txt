Abstract    :
                  9322052  Rowland  This award provides support to the Department of
              Psychology at the University  of Florida to establish an REU site in the field
              of psychobiology.  Applicants  will be solicited from schools in the
              Southeastern United States, with special  emphasis on smaller undergraduate
              and/or minority institutions at which  students do not otherwise have an
              opportunity for gaining research  experience.  The eight selected applicants
              will spend 12 weeks at UF, during  which time they will complete a small
              research project under the direct  supervision of a faculty mentor.  Ten
              primary faculty, all with active research  programs in the general field, will
              participate along with several affiliated  faculty and graduate assistants.  A
              variety of observational, surgical,  biochemical, computer, and other
              analytical techniques are available to the   students.  In addition to 
              research, students will attend a classroom   course which will cover a range of
              relevant issues including faculty research,  ethical issues, experimental
              design, and principles of psychobiology.  The  students will learn
              communication skills by giving interim and final oral  reports of their
              research projects.  ***
