Abstract    :
                9322688  COWART                                ABSTRACT    This SGER project
              will gather data on judged sentence acceptability  relating to the "that"-trace
              phenomenon. Thee populations will be  sampled: two groups of university
              undergraduates and one group of  elderly informants. The purpose of this
              project is to demonstrate  that the "that"-trace phenomenon can be precisely
              characterized in  each of the three target populations, and that there are 
              statistically reliable differences among those populations. If the  project is
              successful, it will be followed up by a regular project  proposal to NSF.  ***
