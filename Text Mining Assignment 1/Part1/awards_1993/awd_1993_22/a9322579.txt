Abstract    :
              Proposal: 9322579                                              ABSTRACTDate:
              01/20/94  PI:  Maitland Jones, Jr.Institution: Princeton University     This
              grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
              Professor  Maitland Jones Jr. at Princeton University to study carbenes and
              nitrenes and their carborane  derivatives. Synthetic and spectroscopic studies
              will be conducted to examine the importance of  precursor chemistry in the
              current methods used for making carbenes, to elucidate a new carbene  'zipper'
              reaction, and to generate novel strained bridgehead olefins which will be
              stabilized by  adamantyl groups. Focal points of this research are the
              exploration of the chemistry of carbene  and nitrene substituted carboranes,
              labeling experiments to elucidate carboranylcarbene  rearrangements, and
              reactions toward aza- and silacarboranes. High spin carboranes incorporating 
              several carbenes and/or nitrenes will be synthesized and studied for their
              properties. Dehydro-o-  carboranes will be used to form hydrocarbon addition
              products.     In this project Dr. Maitland Jones will conduct synthetic and
              spectroscopic studies on a spectrum  of carbenes and nitrenes including those
              that contain a carboranyl substituent. His research is  directed to improve
              current methods for generating these highly reactive species and to expand 
              their application for syntheses of new strained olefins and unsaturated
              carboranes. Fundamental  synthetic and mechanistic information will be obtained
              from these reactive intermediates that  crosses the boundaries between organic
              and inorganic chemistry.
