Abstract    :
              9322106  Barber  Frictional heating of brakes generates thermoelastic 
              instabilities which can result in vibrations at high speed.  The  phenomenon is
              particularly pronounced in high performance  systems, such as those which
              currently are under development for  automotive uses.  Analytical methods for
              determining critical  speeds of hot spot development will be extended from
              semifinite  conditions to the finite dimensions of actual brake systems.  The 
              approach assumes exponential growth with time of an initially  small
              perturbation, modifies the problem to an eigenvalue problem  in spatial
              dimension only, and discretizes it by the finite  element method.  Parallel
              experiments to validate the results  will be run at Allied Signal Corporation's
              Friction Materials  Department.  ***
