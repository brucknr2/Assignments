Abstract    :
              9322574  Hammel    In July 1994 Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 is predicted to collide
              with the  planet Jupiter.  This event will provide a unique opportunity to
              learn  fundamental parameters about the Jovian atmosphere.  This project is 
              one of four in a coordinated campaign that involves investigators from the 
              University of Arizona, Lowell Observatory, Massachusetts Institute of 
              Technology, and NASA Ames Research Center.  The groups will deploy  portable,
              high-speed CCD systems to four sites spaced in longitude  around the globe for
              the purpose of recording an epochal series of  collisions of various subnuclei
              of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with the planet  Jupiter.  The objectives of the
              observations are to obtain images of all  faces of Jupiter in several passbands
              immediately prior to the encounters,  to record the flashes produced by the
              incoming bolides as seen in light  reflected off the Galilean satellites, to
              document the changes produced in  the planet's appearance as a result of the
              impacts, and to record the  evolution of affected belts and zones as the planet
              settles back to  equilibrium.
