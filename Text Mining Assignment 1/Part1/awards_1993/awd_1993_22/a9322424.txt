                            #| ~                 Aubrey 9322424  The Black Sea is a region of
              great scientific interest in the U.S. However, historical data on the Black Sea
              are rare in the west, though such data are essential for improving our
              understanding of processes in the region.  In particular, modelers and chemists
              are interested in the hydrography to establish a climatology and to examine
              long term changes in the Black Sea. Moscow State University now has offered to
              make available their data base on Black Sea hydrography,  consisting of nearly
              90,000 hydrographic stations extending from 1920 to 1991.  These data have been
              quality controlled internally, and averaged into 303 different Black Sea bins
              to provide climatological averages.  This present effort is to work with Moscow
              State University to complete the quality control of the data, to bring the data
              bank to Woods Hole to make it available to the U.S. scientific community and   
                   S b   -     to publish a technical report describing the data and its
              quality control procedures.
