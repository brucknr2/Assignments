Abstract    :
                    9322300  Jackson    This award provides funds to Morehouse College to
              establish a Research Experience for  Undergraduate Site which will give six
              undergraduate African-American students an  opportunity to participate in a
              unique research experience at Zoo Atlanta.  Students will  conduct summer
              studies in animal behavior and conservation biology.  The goal of this  program
              is to inspire and motivate students to pursue an advanced degree, and 
              ultimately, a research career.  Student participants will be drawn from the
              Psychology  and Biology departments of four historically black colleges (HBC's)
              in Atlanta  (Morehouse College, Spelman College, Morris Brown College and
              Clark-Atlanta  University).  The program will last for eight weeks in the
              summer, followed by a  Directed Studies course in the fall with Project
              Director Dr. Jackson.    Initially, students will participate in an intensive
              three-day orientation to  behavioral research at Zoo Atlanta, during which they
              will finalize the methodology  for an original aspect of an ongoing research
              project.  Following orientation,  students will work individually on these
              research projects under the guidance of  Project Director Dr. Jackson, Project
              Co-Director Dr. Forthman, and Project  Participants Drs. Maple and Stevens. 
              Students will participate in weekly research  seminars in which they, along
              with other researchers at the zoo, will discuss the  progress of their
              research, and develop original strategies for investigating and  furthering
              ongoing research projects taking place at the zoo and their prospective 
              campuses.  ***
