Abstract    :
              9322080  van Breemen    This grant is for support of the 1994 FASEB Conference
              on Smooth  Muscle.  This meeting is held once every three years and is unique 
              in that it is the most comprehensive meeting on smooth muscle.  New 
              developments in techniques related to molecular biology, imaging,  laser flash
              photolysis, membrane permeabilization and patch  clamping have contributed to
              important advances in the  understanding of smooth over the past three years. 
              An organizing  principle of this meeting will be assessment of how far the
              field  has progressed towards answering a number of central questions as  a
              result of this impressive recent technical progress.  The format  of this
              meeting will particularly encourage participation by junior  scientists.  ***
