Abstract    :
              9322111  Dixon    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for nine under- 
              graduate students to gain research experience in theoretical and  experimental
              studies of the physical properties of optical  materials and lasers.  The
              participants will be involved in  closely related, individual projects in nine
              laboratories within  the Department of Physics and Center for Laser Research. 
              The  projects will focus on the properties of laser-host and electro-  optic
              materials, such as oxide and fluoride glasses, lithium  yttrium fluoride,
              bismuth silicon oxide, and III-V and II-VI  semiconductor compounds and quantum
              well devices, all of which  have present or near term application in optical
              devices.  The  participants will be actively involved in nine related projects 
              involving crystal growth, time-resolved site-selection  spectroscopy, laser
              instabilities, growth and optical  characterization of quantum well structures,
              thermal and  electrical transport properties, light scattering, and thermally 
              and optically stimulated luminescence.  %%%  This program introduces
              outstanding undergraduate scientists to  the area of optical materials and
              lasers at a formative stage in  their careers.  The materials to be
              investigated (e.g., laser  host, electro-optic, photo refractive and colloidal)
              are high  technology materials for current and future generation optical 
              systems.  All of the investigations will be undertaken in state-  of-the-art
              laboratories.  All of the faculty mentors have had  successful experience with
              undergraduates in their laboratories.  Particular emphasis will be given to the
              participation of women  and minorities.  ***
