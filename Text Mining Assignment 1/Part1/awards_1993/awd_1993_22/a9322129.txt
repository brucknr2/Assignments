Abstract    :
              9322129  Rieke    The 2 micron spectral region contains a variety of indicators
              about the  atmosphere of Jupiter including absorption features due to hydrogen
              and  methane, auroral emissions, and reflected light from aerosols.  Dr. Rieke 
              will monitor changes in all of these indicators and search for additional 
              features due to chemical species created by the impact of Comet  Shoemaker-Levy
              (9) on Jupiter.
