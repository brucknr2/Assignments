Abstract    :
              9322119  Spinrad    Since the timings, locations, and results of specific entry
              events is difficult  to know ahead of time, Dr. Spinrad plans a comprehensive
              series of  observations on the large-scale circum-Jovian environment to be
              carried out  at the Lick and Leuschner Observatories.  The scientific goals
              include  imaging the boundaries and observing the flows in the outer Jovian 
              magnetosphere, detailing potentially radical changes, and watching the 
              recovery of the Io plasma torus.  Dr. Spinrad will also observe the spectra of 
              some large-impact fireballs via satellite reflection spectra and will image 
              morphological changes in the Jovian atmosphere.
