Abstract    :
              CTS-9322772  CACHE Corporation  L. T. Biegler    ABSTRACT    Funds from this
              project provide travel assistance to U.S. faculty and graduate students to
              attend the conference "Foundations of Computer Aided Design '94."  Attendees
              will critically assess the current state of knowledge and examine future
              directions for the field of computer-aided process design.  Of particular
              emphasis will be new mathematical models which are more accurate and efficient,
              new synthesis and optimization strategies, and recent advances in software and
              hardware which have facilitated the use of more sophisticated and complex
              techniques in process design.    The chemical manufacturing industry provides
              materials and items used in the production of automobiles, in building and
              housing construction and in many other industries.  Computer-aided design is
              critical to the incorporation of ongoing developments in the chemical
              manufacturing, so that American firms are more economically competitive, energy
              efficient, and environmentally friendly from inception.
