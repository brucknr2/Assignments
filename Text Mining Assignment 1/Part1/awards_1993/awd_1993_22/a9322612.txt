Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Professor T. C. Steimle of Arizona State University will   investigate (a)
              early transition metal containing transient species   associated with
              laser-induced plasma dehydrogenation reactions that   produce
              metallo-carbonhedrenes and microclusters of titanium nitride, and   (b) late
              second row (rhodium, palladium and silver) and third row   (iridium, platinum
              and gold) transition metal dihydrides, carbenes,   amides, imides, and
              metal-methyl,  metal-ammonia and  metal-water   insertion products.  The
              species will be prepared by a combined laser   ablation  and supersonic
              expansion technique, and will be probed by   methods of high resolution
              spectroscopy.  Among these are the laser   induced fluorescence in the presence
              of a variable d.c. electric field    and pump-probe microwave -optical double
              resonance techniques.     The research will provide data for the fundamental
              understanding of the   reaction chemistry of metals with organic and inorganic
              molecules.       This research has high relevance for the development of
              sophisticated   technologies, such as wear resistant coatings, and for
              developments in   catalysis.
