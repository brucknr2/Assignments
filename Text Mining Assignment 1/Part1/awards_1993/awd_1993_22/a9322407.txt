Abstract    :
              This REU Site will recruit students nationally to join an  REU Site focused on
              the research in high energy physics at  the UCSC Particle Detector Research
              Center.  Students will  be assigned to the various projects of the Center, so
              they  can gain substantial familiarity with the equipment used in  such
              research.
