Abstract    :
              Hakansson      Computer technology can increase student interest in science
              topics by allowing students   to become more involved in the analytic process
              of problem solving and, at the same time,   freeing  them from getting mired in
              highly technical procedures and repetitive   mathematical computations.  Yet
              despite the advantages of new technologies, including   interactive software, 
              teachers have found it difficult to integrate existing products into   their
              teaching plans.  Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              (SBIR)   study establish the technical basis for the creation of a new software
              tool  Science Analysis   Multimedia ( SAM) to facilitate turning the promise of
              computer technology in K-12   science instruction into reality.  SAM will
              consist of a shell (video playback and analysis   capabilities as well as
              features for data gathering, computation, and presentation) and    learning
              modules (video and text data organized in subtopics and groups according to  
              major scientific themes);  it is unique in that it is designed to function both
              as a content-  neutral tool and as a modular science program.  The objectives
              of the Phase II research   focus on  (1) developing and testing the prototype
              of the SAM software tool; (2)   developing and testing prototype classroom
              materials; (3) developing and testing model   teacher workshops; (4) assessing
              attitudes and achievement among various students who   use SAM; and (5)
              developing means of making SAM available to the broadest spectrum of  
              students.    The project will contribute to the creation of a software tool
              employing state-of-the-art   digital video technology and advanced programming
              techniques and combining many of   the most useful computer applications to
              assist teachers in the delivery of the new science   curriculum.
