Abstract    :
              9322487  Shoemaker    The impending collisions of the fragments of Comet
              Shoemaker-Levy 9 on  Jupiter are of major interest in terms of testing a wide
              range of theories on  cometary, collisional, and atmospheric shock conditions
              and processes.   Dr. Shoemaker will lead a study that will attempt to simulate
              the impacts  on Jupiter.  The model results can be used to predict observable
              effects  and to compare with observations after the event.
