Abstract    :
                    9322232  Winter  This award provides funds to Thomas Jefferson University
              to establish an REU Site that  will enable talented undergraduate students
              between their junior and senior years to  participate in biochemical/molecular
              biology research and in a series of classroom  experiences.  The overall goal
              is to foster an understanding and appreciation of what  biochemists and
              molecular biologists do.  The result will be an increase in the pool of 
              talented and motivated students who intend to pursue careers in biological 
              research.  ***
