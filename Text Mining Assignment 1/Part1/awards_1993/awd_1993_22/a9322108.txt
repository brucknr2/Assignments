Abstract    :
              9322108  Teeri                 This award provides funds for another three years
              to continue the successful REU Program.  Ten undergraduates (per session)
              interested in research in field biology will be selected to  participate in a
              program at the University of Michigan Biological Station in Pellston, MI.  
              Students will both learn and live at the Station during the nine-week summer
              session.  The  research experience is the focus of their academic activities
              during that period.  Students will  work with a faculty mentor, attend special
              REU evening workshops, attend REU weekly  discussion meetings, attend general
              seminars at the Station, and develop their own research  projects (from
              conception of the ideas through data collection to verbal and written presen- 
              tation of the study).  Students are selected on the basis of academic
              excellence, letters of  recommendation, and evidence of interest in research. 
              After participation in the program,  each student will help in the evaluation
              of his/her experiences in the program .  ***
