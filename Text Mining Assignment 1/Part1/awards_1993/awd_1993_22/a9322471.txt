Abstract    :
              9322471 Christensen          Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site
              grant support is requested for 8 students in Solid Earth Geophysics for each of
              the next three years at the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska
              Fairbanks.  The program will give undergraduates majoring in geology,
              geophysics, physics, and closely related disciplines, experience working in a
              research environment.  The program objective is to acquaint undergraduates with
              exciting research opportunities in the various fields of geophysics
              concentrating on seismology, volcanology, geochronology, geochemistry,
              paleomagnetics and tectonics and encouraging the undergraduates to go on to
              graduate school in these or other scientific fields.  Women and minorities will
              be particularly encouraged to apply.  Many of the students will be recruited
              from small liberal arts colleges throughout the Nation, and programs like this
              are likely to be their only opportunity for in depth exposure to the fields of
              solid earth sciences before they must make decisions regarding graduate school.
               In their contacts with graduate students and by attending seminars and thesis
              defenses, the students will obtain an accurate perspective of graduate student
              life.  In this program, students are assigned to work with individual faculty
              investigators on projects assigned by the investigators.  In addition there
              will be an organized series of weekly lectures and field trips to expose
              students to other fields of research beyond the scope of their own project.
