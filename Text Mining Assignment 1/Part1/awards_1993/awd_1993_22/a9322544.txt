Abstract    :
              9322544  Parker  The behavior of animals determines the movement of alleles
              within and among populations and thus defines basic characteristics of
              population genetic parameters. In addition, gene flow is regulated by dispersal
              events from natal to breeding sites, and by subsequent dispersal during the
              lifetime of the individual. Finally, site tenacity (philopatry) may reduce
              genetic diversity in a population because individuals return to the same
              breeding sites each year. The purpose of this conservation and restoration
              biology research is to determine the mating systems in two populations of the
              endangered green sea turtle. Specifically, the PI will use molecular approaches
              to accurately reconstruct parental genotypes in this species, and use these
              data to extend existing models of the interaction between mating systems and
              effective population size for different populations and rates of reproductive
              failure in the green sea turtle.  %%%  To effectively understand the role of
              breeding systems in the maintenance of genetic diversity in wild populations of
              endangered species, it is necessary to measure patterns of within- versus
              between-population paternity. Essentially, genetic diversity will be maintained
              under a certain frequency of paternity from members of disparate populations.
              This research is important because it will use molecular markers in a
              non-destructive fashion to monitor the potential for enhancing genetic
              diversity in a species whose behavior is difficult to observe  in nature.  ***
