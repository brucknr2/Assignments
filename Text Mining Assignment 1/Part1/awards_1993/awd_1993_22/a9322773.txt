Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   is a
              series of  investigations of the detailed mechanisms of redox   reactions that
              occur at electrode surfaces. These studies will include a   detailed analysis
              of multielectron transfer reactions, a study of the   derivatives of the
              fullerenes, and an inquiry into the nucleation   processes involved in
              electrochemical polymerization reactions.  The   latter study will involve the
              use of atomic force microscopy to detect   and characterize the particles
              formed in the early stages of the   electrodeposition of organic compounds. The
              results of the research will   have direct applications in such technologically
              significant areas as   electrosynthesis, electropolymerization, and homogeneous
              redox catalysis.    This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program,   will increase our understanding of the fundamental aspects
              of the   oxidation and reduction reactions of organic compounds at electrode  
              surfaces.  Novel features of the research include the use of atomic force  
              microscopy to image the surface of the electrode during the   electrodeposition
              of organic compounds, a study of the electrochemistry   of the recently
              discovered fullerenes, as well as the investigation of   electrode processes
              involving multiple electron transfer reactions. The   results of the research
              will have direct applications in such   technologically significant areas as
              electrosynthesis,   electropolymerization, and homogeneous redox catalysis.
