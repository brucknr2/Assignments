Abstract    :
              9322303  Lee    This award is to provide funds for studying the lifetime of the
              Computer Division of the General Electric Corporation from its establishment in
              1956 to its sale to Honeywell Information Systems in 1968.  It is the intent of
              this work to create a case study reviewing the interaction between the
              technological and management activities of these twelve years and to evaluate
              the reasons for the demise of this division.  The research involves
              interviewing some key pioneers, top executives, technical and administrative
              personnel of the corporation.  A full report of this case study will provide
              some insights to the factors relating to the success and failure of the
              Computer Division.  ***
