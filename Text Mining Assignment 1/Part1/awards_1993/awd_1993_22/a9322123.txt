Abstract    :
              9322123  Hunten    The impacts of the pieces of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 should
              generate  strong waves and fronts and produce chemical changes in Jupiter's 
              stratosphere.  Wave propagation is highly diagnostic of the thermal and 
              compositional structure of the atmosphere and interior.  Dr. Hunten and a 
              group of colleagues will use mid-infrared wavelength spectroscopy and  imaging
              to characterize the waves due to changes in the stratospheric  heating and
              cooling and in chemical compounds.
