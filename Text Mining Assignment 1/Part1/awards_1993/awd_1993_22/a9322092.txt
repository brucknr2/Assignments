Abstract    :
                          9322092  HENSEL  This  anthropological  research  project  seeks  to
               explain  the  processes of cross-cultural communication as exemplified  by 
              the  interactions of Yup'ik Eskimos and non-natives in Bethel, Alaska.  The 
              research has applications in both practical and  theoretical  ways.  It can
              increase our practical understanding of how  people  learn  to  communicate  in
               cross-cultural  settings,  and   also  contribute an analysis of the theories
              of practice/structuration,  of   relevance   to   anthropology  and  other  
              social   science  disciplines.  Research  will  be  conducted  through  formal 
              and  informal  interviews, participant observation and  attendance  at  public
              meetings.  ***
