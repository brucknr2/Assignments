Abstract    :
              9322765  Manchester       PIs will investigate the paleoclimatic utility of
              Tertiary  fossil woods by focusing on wood assemblages from strata that have 
              also yielded leaf and/or fruit floras that have played an important  role in
              the interpretation of paleoclimatic change in the western  U.S. (Eocene Clarno
              Formation, Oregon; Miocene Vantage Forest,  Wwashington State).  Two
              approaches--comparison with extant floras  and evaluation of xylem
              physiognomy--will be used.   Work will   help develop a methododolgy for using
              wood anatomy to infer  paleoclimates that is independent of other methods.
