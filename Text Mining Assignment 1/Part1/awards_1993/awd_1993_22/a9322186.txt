Abstract    :
              9322186  Kunz  This award provides funds to continue a successful REU SITE at
              Boston University.   Five cross-disciplinary, team-oriented projects will
              provide each group of two  students with opportunities to work closely with two
              experienced faculty mentors on a  collaborative project.  The emphasis on this
              REU Site project is to promote  collaborative research among students and
              research biologists whose disciplines have  traditionally focused on different
              sub-disciplines.  Collaborative research topics  include:  expression of
              bacterial proteins, mechanisms of gene induction in retinal  cells, hormonal
              responses to stress in bats, kinship and population processes in voles,  and
              termite foraging ecology and wood chemistry.  Faculty mentors have been 
              carefully selected on the basis of their experience with undergraduates in the 
              classroom, research contacts with undergraduates, and their own scholarly 
              contributions.  Five students will be selected from regional, four-year
              colleges that do  not provide significant opportunities for research and five
              will be selected from  students attending Boston University.  Recruitment
              efforts will specifically target  minority, women, and physically-challenged
              students.  Selection procedures will be  based on scholarly aptitude, research
              potential, and previous experience.  An ethics  component with weekly seminars
              on topics such as ethical treatment of animals, record  keeping and data
              management, values and integrity in science, responsibility of  authorship, and
              reporting and investigating allegations of misconduct.  This ethics  component
              will be shared with REU students from Wellesley College and the  University of
              Massachusetts (Boston Campus), and joint seminars, activities, and field  trips
              have been planned in collaboration with REU programs at these regional 
              institutions.  ***
