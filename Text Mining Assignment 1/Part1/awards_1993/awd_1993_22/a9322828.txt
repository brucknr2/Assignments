Abstract    :
              9322828  Simchi-Levi       The emphasis in this research is to perform a
              theoretical  analysis of vehicle routing problems with the objective of 
              developing robust and efficient algorithms for the problems.  The  objective is
              to be attained through the understanding of the  underlying theoretical
              structure of optimal solutions and using the  results to develop practical and
              efficient algorithms that take  advantage of this structure.  To understand the
              underlying  structure, different variant forms of vehicle routing problems will
               be analyzed to develop and implement different algorithms.       This research
              has a good potential to produce some additional  insight into the vehicle
              routing problem.  Such insight is critical  in developing efficient algorithms
              for this class of problems.   Vehicle routing problem exist in both the public
              and private  sectors.  Improvement in the vehicle routing can produce
              efficiency  in fleet management, and consequently, significant savings in 
              travel time and operating cost.  The importance of this problem is  well
              demonstrated by the support the research is receiving from a  key member of the
              users community of the research output, namely,  school systems.
