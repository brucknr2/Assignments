Abstract    :
              9322037  Jennings  Montana State Univ       This award from the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division will support
              an annual workshop in organometallic chemistry. The participants will be
              organometallic chemists from academia, industry, and private and government
              research organizations. The goals of the workshop are to facilitate
              communication among researchers in the different kinds of organizations and to
              foster the exchange of new ideas much earlier than is possible through formal
              publications. The format of the workshop is designed to encourage maximum
              participation by all attendees, and the plan for selecting attendees will
              ensure broadly based participation. The topics to be discussed will span a
              broad spectrum from synthesis of new organometallic compounds to the
              utilization of such compounds as catalysts or as precursors for making new
              materials. However, the topics of "Benign Chemical Synthesis and Processing"
              and "Critical Technologies" will form the overall themes of the workshop.
