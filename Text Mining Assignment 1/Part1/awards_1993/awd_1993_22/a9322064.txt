Abstract    :
                    9322064  Fried           This award provides support to continue a
              successful REU SITE for an  additional three years.  The Program in Molecular
              Biology and Biotechnology,  an independent campus-wide unit, created to promote
              genetic engineering  research and education at the University of North Carolina
              at Chapel Hill, will  sponsor the program.  Academically successful students
              and students from  disadvantaged backgrounds who exhibit high scholastic
              promise and who  would benefit from an independent study experience will be
              chosen from a  national applicant pool to participate in research projects
              conducted by UNC  faculty.  A total of 10 students will be supported by the
              National Science  Foundation REU program and five additional students are
              expected to be  supported with University funds.  Emphasis will be placed on
              recruiting  students from schools with limited research opportunities and
              students  historically underrepresented in the sciences.  The primary focus of
              the  training program will be encouraging pursuit of, and providing preparation
              for,  advanced degrees in the biological sciences.  To meet these goals
              students will  (1) work for 10 weeks on faculty-developed laboratory research
              projects, (2)  meet with preceptors for informal seminars about science and
              personal  accounts of how and why faculty became research scientists, (3)
              attend field  trips to major research pharmaceutical companies and the National
              Institutes  of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, NC, and
              to  coastal marine labs operated by UNC and Duke University, (4) attend a 
              Graduate-Professional Student Roundtable to learn in detail about life in 
              graduate school, and (5) present the results of their research in talks before 
              the community.  ***
