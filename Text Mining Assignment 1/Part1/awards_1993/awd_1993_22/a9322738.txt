Abstract    :
              9322738  Kustin    The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project 
              between Dr. Kenneth Kustin of Brandeis University and Dr. Miklos  Orban of
              Eotvos University, Budapest, is to examine oscillating  chemical reactions in
              three major areas.  First, a number of  systems involving bromite ion,
              formaldehyde, molecular oxygen and  both homogeneous and heterogeneous
              transition metal-catalyzed  reactions will be studied for possible new
              oscillating reactions.   Second, mechanistic studies will be performed on
              several  oscillatory systems and related subsystems including permanganate 
              reactions and sulfur-containing reactions.  Finally, research  will be carried
              out on reactions in which spatial patterns and  chemical waves occur.  These
              studies will probe Turning patterns,  the effects of magnetic fields on
              chemical waves and the design  of new chemical systems that show pattern
              formation.  The  combined results are expected to lead to new advances in basic
               chemical kinetics and, potentially, to applications in biological  and
              industrial processes.    This project in chemical dynamics fulfills the program
              objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in 
              the United States and Eastern Europe  to combine complementary  talents and
              pool research resources in areas of strong mutual  interest and competence.
