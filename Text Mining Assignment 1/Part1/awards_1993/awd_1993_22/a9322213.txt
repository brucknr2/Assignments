Abstract    :
              9322213  Yacov  The work addresses the issue of managing the risk of extreme 
              events in engineered systems under climate change conditions.  The research
              will consist of three tasks of which the first will  be to determine the
              potential application of existing risk  management methods to global climate
              change; the second will be  to establish the links among the statistics of
              extreme events,  the conditional risk function as a measure of extremes, and
              the  generalized concept of return period; and the third task will  deal with
              the application of the results from the first two tasks  to the assessment and
              management of flood risk under potential  climate change including
              decision-making for the risk-based  design of engineered systems.  The results
              from this work will be  the improved understanding of the potential impact of
              climate  changes on engineering planning and design for flood control.  ***
