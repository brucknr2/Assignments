Abstract    :
              9322718  Berejka  This is an award to support International Travel by the 
              applicant to attend and participate in the 9th International  Meeting on
              Radiation Processing that will be held in  Istanbul, Turkey from September 11
              to 16, 1994.  Conference  topics include  radiation chemistry, uses of
              radiation in  sterilization and food processing, environmental  applications of
              radiation, dosimetry, industrial  applications, radiation sources and new
              developments in  radiation processing.  The applicant's itinerary includes 
              visits to the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Institute of  Physical Chemistry
              in Moscow; the Institute of Nuclear  Chemistry and Technology in Warsaw; and
              the headquarters of  the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.    This
              conference is an important international meeting at  which advances in
              radiation processing across a wide  spectrum of applications will be discussed.
               Results  associated with supporting the applicant's travel are  expected to
              include information that can be utilized in  assisting determination of the
              scope of future program  support of research on environmental applications of
