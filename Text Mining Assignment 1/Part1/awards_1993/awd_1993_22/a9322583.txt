Abstract    :
              9322583  Cronin       This award is to operate the Chicago Air Shower Array 
              (CASA)  at Dugway Utah for three years.  The array was constructed  with  NSF
              funding over a period of three years to verify the  existence  of isolated high
              energy gamma sources which had been  reported in  the literature.  This is the
              largest array of this kind in  the  world and it operates in conjunction with a
              muon array built  by  the University of Michigan (MIA) on the same site.  The 
              combination of the two make a powerful tool to distinguish  between incident
              gamma rays and incident charged particles.  They  have operated for about one
              year and their results as well  as the  results from other experiments have
              shown that the alleged  sources no longer exist.  If the sources are episodic,
              CASA  hopes  to find them over the course of the next three years.  In 
              addition they will be able to make significant contributions  to  our knowledge
              of the cosmic ray composition and to the  energy  spectrum.  They also have a
              program to extend their energy  reach  by coordinating their observations with
              those of the Fly's  Eye,  another detector at Dugway operated by the University
              of  Utah  that looks at even higher energies by detecting atmospheric 
              fluorescence, and which overlaps CASA in coverage and in  energy.  ***
