Abstract    :
              9322089  Thews  Opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in 
              ongoing research projects in experimental physics are  structured in a summer
              REU program.  Students may choose  from a wide variety of forefront physics
              activities, under  the direction of senior faculty members from the Department 
              of Physics at the University of Arizona.  The main student  audience will be
              those who have finished the equivalent of  the first or second year curriculum
              in science or  engineering at Pima Community College, in preparation for 
              transfer to a 4-year degree program.  This program will also  be available to
              similarly prepared students from regions  outside southern Arizona who will be
              resident in Tucson  during the summer.  Graduate Teaching Assistants from the 
              physics department will serve as mentors for the students.  Special orientation
              and skills activities will be  individually tailored to enable the students to
              make  significant contributions to the research projects.  Opportunities exist
              in many cases for the students to  continue their associations with the
              research project after  the completion of the summer REU program, most often as
              paid  laboratory associates.  Recruitment activities will place  special
              emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities.  Because most students will
              start in this program at a very  early point in their scientific education, we
              encourage  continuity in their development by allowing past  participants to
              apply for admission in subsequent summer  sessions.  ***
