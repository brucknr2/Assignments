Abstract    :
              9322525  Badiru         The research addresses the development of a performance 
              measurement methodology for design integration in manufacturing  systems.  The
              methodology uses a hybrid model of a state-space  representation and expert
              system.  The design process is based on  the Pahl and Beitz systematic approach
              to design.  The Triple C  model of project management is used to facilitate the
               communication, cooperation, and coordination required for design  integration.
                    Many conceptual integration approaches are available in the  literature. 
              Most existing approaches lack a quantitative  performance measure to drive
              integration efforts.  This performance  measure is a unique, quantifiable
              approach to evaluating design  integration.  This research facilitates the
              implementation of the  concurrent engineering concept in design and
              manufacturing.
