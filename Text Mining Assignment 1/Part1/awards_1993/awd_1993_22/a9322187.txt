Abstract    :
              Proposal #: 93-22187    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V ENDEAVOR, a 177 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and
              operated by the University.  Instrumentation requested includes water sampling
              bottles, a fluorometer, a rosette system, a thermosalinograph, and a digital
              bathymetry system.  The instrumentation is required for support of NSF-funded
              cruises aboard the ENDEAVOR during 1994 and will enhance the scientific
              capability of the vessel in the future.
