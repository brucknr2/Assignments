Abstract    :
              9322326  Stout       This award supports mathematical research on aspects of the
               theory of boundary behavior of holomorphic functions of several  complex
              variables and related questions.  One major direction of  the work concerns
              removable singularities for the boundary values  of holomorphic functions, that
              is, when can a function be  extended to a point and a neighborhood as an
              holomorphic  function?  These points are called removable singularities.  A 
              related direction of the work focuses on the study of removable  sets for
              holomorphic functions.  These are sets where the  natural boundary values of an
              holomorphic function agree with  those of a continuous function.  Work will
              also be done on  domains which are not necessarily bounded by smooth manifolds,
              an  area of several complex variables which has not received much  attention to
              date.  Finally, work will continue on the study of  Cauchy-Riemann functions in
              terms of one-dimensional slices of  their underlying domains.       Several
              complex variables arose at the beginning of  the century as a natural outgrowth
              of studies of functions of  one complex variable.  It became clear early on
              that the  theory differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying  geometry
              was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory  had far more affinity
              with partial differential operators of  first order.  It thus grew as a hybrid
              subject combining deep  characteristics of differential geometry and
              differential  equations.  Many of the fundamental structures were defined in 
              the last three decades.  Current studies still concentrate on  understanding
              these basic mathematical forms.  ***
