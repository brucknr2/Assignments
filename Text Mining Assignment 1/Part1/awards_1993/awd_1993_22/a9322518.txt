Abstract    :
              9322518  Saltzman  This award is for support for  an investigation of the
              distribution of methanesulfonate (MSA) in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two
              (GISP2) ice core in order to assess the relationship between biogenic sulfur
              emissions, atmospheric aerosols, and climate change over the North Atlantic
              Ocean.  This project is primarily directed at completing the GISP2  MSA record
              from Summit, Greenland which will cover an entire glacial/interglacial cycle. 
              The GISP2 record has already demonstrated dramatic differences between
              glacial/interglacial trends in Greenland as compared to Antarctica.  This work
              will provide new information about the factors controlling the variability in
              the atmospheric sulfur signal and its relationship to other changes in
              atmospheric chemistry.  Samples from two other Greenland ice cores (Camp
              Century and Dye-3) will also be studied to examine climate-related variability 
              of MSA during the Holocene.  ***
