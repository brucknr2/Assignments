                                        ABSTRACT                                              
                                 AST-9322779  Kenny, Jeffrey    The Principal Investigator
              will investigate the effects of  both local dynamics and the cluster
              environment on the  properties of massive star formation in galaxies by a 
              detailed examination of high resolution images and rotation  curves of Virgo
              cluster and isolated spiral galaxies.  By  first understanding how the
              properties of the star-forming  disks depend on local dynamics, he will
              identify  environmental factors which influences star formation.  This  study
              will increase our understanding of the factors which  control star formation
              and spiral structure in all galaxies.  ***
