Abstract    :
              9322225  Demas  University of Virginia  Dr. James  N. Demas and other members of
              the Chemistry Department of the University of  Virginia are being supported for
              a Research Experiences for Undergraduates  (REU) site in  Chemistry.  For the
              period 1994-6, twelve undergraduates will spend ten weeks each summer  actively
               engaged in a variety of research projects.  Projects cover the traditional 
              areas of  chemistry-analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. 
              A unique feature will be  the selecting of students from predominantly
              undergraduate  institutions and then inviting and  subsidizing the visit of the
              student's faculty mentor from their home institution to an REU  symposium.
