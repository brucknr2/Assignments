Abstract    :
              9322477  Greene    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will explore adaptive optical fiber vibration mode sensors for
              monitoring structural vibration.  Phase I research found a feasible technique
              in use of a tapered two-mode optical fiber and a tunable wavelength optical
              source to fashion a sensor whose strain sensitivity varies with optical
              wavelength.  Phase II will test alternative approaches to various functioning
              elements of the sensor and test a full system laboratory prototype.    The
              proposed fiber optic vibration sensor is capable of replacing tens of
              single-point, single-measurand electrical-based sensors.  Benefits of
              multiplexed, distributed fiber optic sensors include significant reduction in
              size and number of physical connections for instrumented structural vibration
              testing.  In addition, cost savings in installation and much less complex
              signal processing can be expected.  Other advantages of optical fiber sensors
              over electrical-based sensors are immunity to electromagnetic interference
              (EMI), high-cycle fatigue capability, low weight, corrosion resistance, and
              absence of long-term drift.
