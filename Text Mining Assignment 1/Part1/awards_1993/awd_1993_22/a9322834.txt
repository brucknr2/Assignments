Abstract    :
              9322834  Kay       The objective of this research is to develop a system to 
              control multiple free-ranging automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) by  monitoring
              the travel areas of the vehicles in a facility.  The  monitoring process is to
              be achieved through the use of overhead  cameras to cover large areas of heavy
              traffic and other types of  sensors for areas where the use of cameras is
              considered to be  uneconomical.  Travel area monitoring can fully exploit the 
              potential capabilities of these vehicles to provide low-cost,  flexible, and
              safe long distance materials handling in a dynamic  indoor environment.  Area
              monitoring will ensure the identification  of short travel time routes for
              vehicles moving between points.       The research addresses a problem that has
              significant  implications in material handling and the operation of the 
              factories of the future.  It is particularly useful in environments  where the
              aisles are shared by different mobile devices, including  operating personnel. 
              The use of free-ranging AGVs offers some  flexibility that wire-guided AGVs do
              not offer.  Their control in  the work area is more challenging, data
              intensive, and taxing in  terms of computational requirements.
