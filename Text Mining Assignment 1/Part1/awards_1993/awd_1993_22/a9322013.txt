Abstract    :
              9322013  Presson  This award provides funds to the University of Maryland to 
              continue their successful REU program in the area of Neuroscience  for an
              additional three years.  In this extension, the PIs have  built upon their
              experience to focus on fostering critical  thinking skills in student
              participants.  The inclusion of both  spring introductory activities, and a
              final fall "independent  contribution" assignment further integrate the
              program. Students  will truly experience the development of their understanding
              of,  and contribution to, a scientific project.  In addition, we have  expanded
              the students' involvement in extracurricular activities  so that their time
              here is even more fully integrated around  their research experience.  The REU
              program is run by the site  Director, Dr. Joelle Presson, who is intimately
              involved with the  students.  She runs the summer journal club, and is a mentor
              for  REU students in her own lab.  The 17 participating REU faculty  are all
              active, productive researchers in the Center for  Neuroscience at University of
              Maryland, College Park. These  faculty come from diverse departments on campus,
              and form an  interactive Neuroscience community here.  We are all supportive 
              of the goals for our new program, and look forward to giving  students these
              valuable opportunities.  ***
