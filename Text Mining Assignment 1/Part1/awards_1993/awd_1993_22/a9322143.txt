Abstract    :
                  9322143  Sheffield  This award provides funds to the Biology Department of
              Temple  University to continue a successful REU site for a combined  academic
              year and Summer program of undergraduate research.  This  program will draw on
              experience as an REU site awardee for  previous years, and also incorporates
              elements of other Temple  programs.  It is the goal of this program to provide
              a rich  research environment and a sense of community among promising  students
              in order to encourage them to enter careers in the  biological sciences.  The
              program is designed to help students  develop self confidence that will allow
              them to progress from  dependence to independence in research.  The Biology
              Department  at Temple University is in a unique position with respect to 
              biological research and education of underrepresented groups.  As  a department
              in a major research university, they have an active  faculty and substantial
              grant support.  At the same time, Temple,  as an urban university, attracts a
              diverse student population.   Many of the students are the first in their
              families to attend  college.  Temple was found that a large number of these
              students  have not considered a career in research despite their abilities.  
              and can benefit significantly from a program such as this.  ***
