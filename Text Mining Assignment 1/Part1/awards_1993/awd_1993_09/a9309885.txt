Abstract    :
              9309885  Spilhaus  The American Geophysical Union will provide partial support
              for  U.S. scientists to attend five different Association Assemblies  sponsored
              by the International Union of Geodesy and Geomagnetism  (IUGG).  The support
              will enable the broadest possible cross  section of U.S. scientists in all of
              the geophysical disciplines  represented by IUGG.  Travel awards for students,
              post-docs,  minorities and women will be emphasized in the selection process.
