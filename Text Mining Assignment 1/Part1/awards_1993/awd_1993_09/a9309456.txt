Abstract    :
               This project focuses on algorithms that work on-line or with  limited
              information.  The project addresses three topics, each   motivated by an
              application in on-line, distributed or parallel  computation:  (1) metrical
              task systems where the set of tasks (inputs to the  system) are restricted. 
              The restriction on the input is part of  the description of the system.  A 
              general, simple algorithm is developed which uses the system specification to 
              approximate the best on-line algorithm for each particular  system;  (2)
              distributed computation where a group of agents must  collectively solve a
              problem.  Each agent receives part of the  input, and a graph is used to
              represent knowledge that is shared  between the agents.  How to use shared 
              information between the agents to solve a distributed job  scheduling problem
              and to determine the value of sharing  information are determined;  (3) the
              problem of partitioning elements of a partial order into  disjoint chains
              on-line, and its applications to  parallel computation are discussed.
