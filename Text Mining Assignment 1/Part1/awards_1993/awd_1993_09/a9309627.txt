Abstract    :
              Panda         This project studies wormhole routing in clustered  multiprocessor
              systems.  A clustered system raises new  communication and synchronization
              issues in parallel systems by  deviating from the traditional assumption of one
              processor per  node.  This project addresses these issues by:  1.    
              developing communication algorithms for frequently used  communication patterns
              on clustered systems;  2.     developing synchronization mechanisms and
              algorithms to  provide concurrent intercluster and intracluster
              synchronization;  and  3.     developing guidelines and architectural supports
              for  interfacing processor clusters to k-ary n-cube wormhole-routed  networks. 
                     Theoretical and probabilistic analysis together with  simulation
              experiments are being used to develop and validate the  results.  This research
              promises significant impact on the  development of future clustered scalable
              systems supporting  various programming paradigms such as distributed-memory,
              cache-  coherent shared memory, and distributed-shared memory.
