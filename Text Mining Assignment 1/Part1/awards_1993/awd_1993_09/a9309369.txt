Abstract    :
              9309369  Glickman  This project is the design phase of a comprehensive database
              for  disasters worldwide, including the development of the requisite  protocols
              for data collection and data processing.  Such a  systematic and comprehensive
              database is necessary for research,  policy analysis, and decision making
              related to the societal  concerns about major natural and technological
              hazards.  The  information incorporated into the database is drawn primarily 
              from current news reports, including both immediate and longer-  term accounts
              of the disaster events.  The design phase of the  project establishes critical
              definitions and selection criteria,  analyzes data sources and electronic data
              collection options, and  develops collection and coding protocols.  All steps
              will be  reviewed by an expert panel before expanding the project into  later
              phases.  ***
