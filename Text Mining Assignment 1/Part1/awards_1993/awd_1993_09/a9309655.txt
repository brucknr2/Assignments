Abstract    :
                  9309655  Fischer  The recent years have seen the development of several
              knowledge-  based scheduling systems that facilitate the integration of design 
              information with the generation of construction schedules.  This  research
              proposes to extend the idea behind these planners and  schedulers by adding
              detailed models of construction methods.  Such  knowledge is needed in
              model-based form to enhance the practicality  of the schedules that are
              generated, and to overcome some of the  limitations of heuristic systems. 
              while the use of product models  to represent design information has been well
              documented over the  last few years, the formalization and implementation of
              detailed  models of construction methods still represents a major challenge 
              and opportunity.  When  interacting with a product model, such  construction
              method  models will be able to generate construction  schedules and cost
              estimates almost instantly.  This will enable  project participants to explore
              more alternatives to a greater  level of detail in less time.  This will lead
              to projects that are  more constuctible than some of today's projects which in
              turn will  lead to a reduced total delivery time and cost for constructed 
              facilities.
