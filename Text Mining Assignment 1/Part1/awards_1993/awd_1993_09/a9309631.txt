Abstract    :
              9309631  Benjaafar       Although the issue of flexibility has become
              increasingly  important to the design and operation of manufacturing systems,
              it  has remained to a large degree ambiguous and poorly understood.   The
              objective of the research is to address some of these  limitations.  In
              particular, the focus of efforts will be on (1)  developing a generic modeling
              framework capable of capturing the  various dimensions of flexibility in
              manufacturing, (2) providing  robust and useful measure(s) of flexibility that
              reflect these  various dimensions, and (3) establishing clear relationships 
              between the degree of flexibility in a manufacturing system and the  system's
              level of performance.  More specifically they will address  the following
              questions:   (1) What constitutes flexibility and to which physical and logical
               characteristics in a manufacturing system can it be traced?   (2) How can
              these characteristics be modeled so that flexibility  can be easily measured
              and analyzed?     (3) Which system performances measures, if any, are
              positively  correlated to flexibility and what are the characteristics of such 
              correlations?    (4) What are the conditions under which flexibility may be of
              value  and what are the operation requirements necessary for realizing  this
              value?    (5) How can the costs and benefits of flexibility be traded-off and 
              optimal, and/or affordable, levels of flexibility be determined?         The
              impact of the research results will be in increased  useability of modeling and
              analysis tools and better measures of  industrial system flexibility and
              performance.
