Abstract    :
              9309316  Shukla  This project focuses on the structure of a group membership 
              service, a basic building block for group-oriented distributed  applications. 
              The objectives of this project are development  and performance
              characterization of a membership service with  multiple classes of service. 
              The emphasis is on categorical  definition of service classes to support a wide
              spectrum of  applications, adaptive status monitoring to minimize wrongly 
              perceived status changes, a completely decentralized and  hierarchical protocol
              requiring an overhead proportional to  the quality of the service rendered, and
              support of a spectrum  of membership semantics in spite of transient network 
              partitioning.    Techniques will be developed to support seamless distribution 
              of large groups across a set of heterogeneous networks by  exploiting the
              attributes of local communication environments  and using topology-based
              optimizations.  Formal techniques  will be used for specification and
              verification implementation  of the protocol.  A performance metric will be
              developed for  characterization of the performance of membership protocols.  
              Performance will be studied with simulations based on  stochastic modeling of
              applications, membership protocols, and  underlying networks.  The simulations
              will be built using  commercial network engineering tools.  The main
              contributions  expected from this research are a single multipurpose 
              membership protocol instead of the current application-  specific variety and
              quantitative performance characterization  which is currently lacking.  ***
