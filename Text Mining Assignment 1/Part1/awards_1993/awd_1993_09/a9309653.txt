Abstract    :
                   The proposed research deals with interrelated subjects in                 
              symplectic geometry, quantization and low dimensional topology.                
              Methods of non-commutative algebras and geometry will be applied               
              to a number of questions in geometric quantization, particularly               
              to the study of moduli of flat connections on bundles over                     
              Riemann surfaces.  This is expected to lead to further insight                 
              into knot invariants and three-dimensional manifolds related to                
              conformal field theories.
