Abstract    :
              9309165  Coppola    This research project deals with the development and
              application  of perturbation methods for obtaining solutions of strongly 
              nonlinear dynamic systems. By providing accurate analytical  approximations of
              motion, the perturbation analysis permit the  development of improved design
              guidelines and control strategies.  They also add to the insights into the
              effects of nonlinearities   by measuring the influence of parameters on system
              response. The  method of averaging, employed in this research, involves a near-
               identity transformation of variables which simplifies the equations  of motion
              by separating responses over fast and slow time scales.  The result is a
              reduced system of equations which is simpler to  analyze that the original
              equations. A symbolic computational  scheme is utilized in this research
              project. The method has  capabilities of having immediate impact on
              understanding complex  systems such as the satellite attitude and orbital
              motion, and  exploring generic behavior of a variety of highly nonlinear
              dynamic  systems.
