Abstract    :
              9309925 Wright           The research will build on an NSF completed research
              project entitled: "Machine tool Open System Advanced Intelligent Controller
              (MOSAIC)."  MOSAIC is a machine tool control environment which provides the
              opportunity to fully integrate advanced methods in computer aided design (CAD),
              computer aided process planning (CAPP), and sensor based computer aided
              precision machining.  Two new courses will be organized to utilize MOSAIC: 
              Integrated Manufacturing for undergraduate education and Software Development
              for Advanced Manufacturing for graduate education.  These will be organized
              around open architecture design, planning and sensor based manufacturing.  The
              graduate course will be project oriented.           The research will transfer
              the MOSAIC architecture to the curriculum to use the integrated CAD/CAPP and
              computer aided manufacturing environment to design and plan out and machine
              complex components.  The knowledge of these technologies may be transferred to
              industry through the student use of the tools.
