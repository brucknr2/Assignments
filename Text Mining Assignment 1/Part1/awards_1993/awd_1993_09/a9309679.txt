Abstract    :
               This project involves experimental research to develop   problem solving
              environment for mechanical system simulation.  Specifically, the research
              develops software tools that  facilitate rapid, high-level creation of
              mechanical system  simulators.  These tools are used to generate simulators 
              for a variety of applications, including real-time vehicle  simulation, legged
              locomotion and robotics, and investigation  of collision and contact problems. 
              There is a great interest in the development of problem  solving environments
              (PSEs) for engineering and science  problems.  One of the key challenges lies
              in developing  computer science techniques that enable integration of 
              supporting technologies such as computer algebra systems,  numerical analysis
              libraries, geometric modeling systems, and  object-oriented programming
              systems.  This research attacks the problem by concentrating on one 
              well-defined but rich domain, rigid-body dynamics simulation.  The project has
              two specific goals: (1) advance the state of  the art in mechanical system
              simulation by making it easier   create and modify dynamics simulators, and (2)
              develop a  software architecture and software tools that extend from  this
              domain to more general problem solving environments.    of the software tools
              to generate dynamics simulators for a  number of different applications
              demonstrate the power of  the approach.
