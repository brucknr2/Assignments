Abstract    :
              9309701  Tonguz  The growth of the size of lightwave networks presents major
              challenges because of the limitations of fiber optics technology.  Optical
              devices (such as access couplers), modulation and detection format employed,
              and access methods used are all important factors  in this network growth
              process.  The main objective of this proposal is to find solutions to this
              problem taking into account all these factors.  In particular, the relationship
              between  scalable and modular networks and the main network design parameters
              (such as amount of fiber required, average propagation delay, fault tolerance
              to multiple node failures, maximum bit rate, maintainability, type and number
              of access couplers required, access delay, maximum throughtput, and required
              buffer size) will be examined and quantified.  Thus, the network growth problem
              can be handled in a concrete way in different enviroments and applications.
