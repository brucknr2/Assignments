Abstract    :
                   Wang will continue his research on K-homology of smooth                   
              algebras, investigating its striking application in operator                   
              theory, its deep connection with geometry and dynamical systems,               
              and with quantization theories.  The machineries developed in                  
              noncommutative differential geometry in the last decade, and the               
              techniques and concepts in quantized functional analysis are the               
              key tolls in this investigation.                                               
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently               
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
