Abstract    :
              9309808  Glaeser  The purpose of this project is to use evidence from U.S.
              cities  to test modern growth theory and use modern growth theory to 
              understand the successes and failures of American cities.  Much  of modern
              growth economics has pointed toward education,  knowledge, and the coordination
              of talent as engines of  productivity expansion.  Forceful arguments and
              cross-national  evidence stress that the "external" effects of education are 
              critical to economic expansion.  Schooling seems to raise  productivity not
              only for those who receive it, but also for  those who live close to the well
              educated.  This research uses  evidence for American cities to (1) further test
              for the  existence of these external effects, (2) test the manner in which 
              these effects operate and (3) determine the magnitude of these  forces.  The
              methodology involves using both individual level  data from the census and the
              Panel Study of Income Dynamics and  city level data.  Ultimately, the goal is
              to get an idea about  how intellectual spillovers work to enhance productivity
              and how  policy can use these spillovers to speed U.S. growth.  ***
