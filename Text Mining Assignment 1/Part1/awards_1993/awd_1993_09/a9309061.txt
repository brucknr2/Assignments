Abstract    :
              9309061  Ketterson    This project is devoted to the study of the order
              parameter  collective modes in the condensed matter systems, principally 
              superfluid 3He and superconducting UPt3.  Superfluid 3He is known  to have an
              unconventional superfluid order parameter and there is  growing evidence that
              the same is true of UPt3.  This project will  continue investigations of
              collective mode phenomena in superfluid  3He with special emphasis on shear
              wave propagation and electric  field effect splittings.  A prediction by the
              principal  investigator, that many collective modes (not just nmr) can be made 
              for the order parameter collective modes in UPt3 using ultrasonic  attenuation
              or electromagnetic absorption.  Their observation would  establish the
              existence if this phenomena in a superconductor (a  topic that has long been
              debated since the development of  conventional superconductor theory) and could
              open the way to their  observation in conventional superconductors.  %%% 
              Quantum systems exhibit complex wave or Vibrational behavior which  can be
              probed by sending sound waves or magnetization waves through  them.  Similar
              techniques can be used to probe the degree to which  a system is magnetic or
              superfluid or superconducting.  This  project uses novel acoustic and other
              means to study a special  superfluid 3He and a so-called unconventional
              superconductor, UPt3.   The experiments will shed light on why all
              superconductors are not  the same, and will provide fundamental information
              that will be of  interest in practical superconductors, the high-Tc
              superconductors,  and other complex assemblies which include liquids, solids,
              nuclei  and even neutron stars.  ***
