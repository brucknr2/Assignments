Abstract    :
              9309775  Lee  The objective is to conduct research for the development of 
              synthetic-aperture tomographic imaging techniques and the  implementation of
              microwave and acoustic prototype systems capable  of quantitative NDE of civil
              structures and materials.  The long-  term goal of this research is the
              realization of high-resolution,  cost-effective, portable imaging devices for
              accurate visualization  of quantitative characterization of the condition of
              civil  structures such as bridges, roadways, harbors, dams and buildings.  
              These imaging devices can be used for not only existing structures  for
              maintenance or safety considerations, but also for newly  constructed
              facilities for verification and inspection purposes.
