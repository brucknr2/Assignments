Abstract    :
              9309579  Papastavrou       Real-world vehicle routing problems are characterized
              by  imprecise or unknown information about future customers and travel  times,
              constantly changing planning horizons, queuing  considerations, resequencing
              and reassignment decisions, and a  variety of performance criteria that include
              waiting time and  delivery costs.  However, classical vehicle routing models
              are  static, assume perfect knowledge of demands, ignore queuing effects  and
              typically only consider travel costs.  Only recently, have new  approaches been
              investigated, taking into consideration both the  dynamic and the stochastic
              aspects of the problems.  The  researchers will combine techniques from both
              areas of operations  research, stochastics and combinatorics, to analyze a
              variety of  stochastic and dynamic (mainly vehicle routing) problems; these 
              problems are more applicable than their traditional deterministic 
              counterparts.       Research results will demonstrate that the models will not 
              only be useful for transportation planning, but also for other  classes of
              problems where congestion effects dominate; these  include scheduling problems,
              bin-packing problems, facility  location problems, and a special class of
              information retrieval  problems in computer science.
