Abstract    :
               The Circuit Isomorphism problem is the problem of deciding  whether two given
              circuits are isomorphic.  Two circuits are  isomorphic, in this sense, when
              they are functionally identical  (compute the same input/output relation) under
              some permutation  of the input values.  The computational complexity of this
              problem has not been  established.  This project undertakes a comprehensive
              study of the  complexity of Circuit Isomorphism  in relation to the standard 
              complexity classes.  It is conjectured that Circuit Isomorphism  is an
              incomplete problem in the Polynomial Hierarchy.  The basis  of this conjecture
              relies on the observation that the counting  version of the Circuit Isomorphism
              problem has a relatively lower  computational complexity.  (The counting
              version of the Circuit  Isomorphism problem asks for the number of permutations
              which  certify the isomorphism between the two circuits.)  Thus, it  seems
              appropriate for the decision problem to have a lower  computational complexity
              as well.  Extensive comparisons are made  to the much better studied Graph
              Isomorphism problem, which is a  special case of the Circuit Isomorphism
              problem.  The results of this study would bring about a better  understanding
              of the computational complexity of Circuit  Isomorphism and establish a new
              link between counting problems  and decision problems.
