Abstract    :
              9309765  Keeling         The abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere is sensitive
              at the  parts-per-million level to biological and anthropogenic activities 
              over a wide range of space and time scales.  Measurements of  variations in
              atmospheric oxygen, detected through changes in the  oxygen to nitrogen ratio,
              can address several important issues  pertaining to the global carbon cycle: 
              (1) the magnitude of new  production of organic matter in surface waters over
              expanses of the  ocean where direct, in situ, observations are lacking, (2) the
               magnitude of any terrestrial carbon sink at northern latitudes, and  (3) the
              relative importance of terrestrial ecosystems versus the  oceans as a sink for
              anthropogenic carbon dioxide.  An improved  understanding of these issues will
              be valuable for making more  accurate forecasts of global climatic and
              biogeochemical changes in  the decades ahead.         The PIs have recently
              made measurements of the oxygen in air  samples collected at several locations
              around the world.  This  project continues these measurements in order to carry
              out a  systematic global survey of the variability in the oxygen to  nitrogen
              ratio.  Measurements will be carried out using a newly  developed
              interferometric technique for oxygen to nitrogen analysis  and using gas
              handling methods that obtain a precision of one part  in 200,000 in the oxygen
              measurement.  ***
