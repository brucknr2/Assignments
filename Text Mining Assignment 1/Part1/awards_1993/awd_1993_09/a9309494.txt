Abstract    :
              9309494  Irwin  The purpose of this research is to analyze the portfolios of 
              wealthy slave owners in antebellum Virginia, and to determine how  they
              allocated their assets among slaves, land, and all other  forms of wealth.  A
              data set will be assembled of estate-  inventories of wealthy decedents from
              the probate records of  Virginia County Courts, and these records will be
              linked to  federal census schedules, county land-tax and deed records, and  to
              personal records such as family letters, histories, and  account books.   The
              research will analyze the resulting linked  data set drawing on modern finance
              theory of portfolio choice.   Of particular interest is whether rich
              southerners were over  committed to slaves and land and averse to investing in 
              manufacturing and commercial finance.  The economic issue of  considerable
              historical significance is the role planter's  portfolio choice played in the
              economic growth and development of  the antebellum south.  This research may
              help explain the  relatively minor role of manufacturing in the development
              process  during that period.  ***
