Abstract    :
              9309888  Yang       A broad program of research in theoretical physics will 
              include work on fundamental issues in the foundations of quantum  physics, on
              superstring theory, investigations in quantum  chromodynamics, including some
              involving extensive use of  computers, and studies of phenomena of enormous
              practical  application, such as materials exhibiting superconductivity at  high
              temperatures.  Quantum physics is important for all  descriptions of phenomena
              which take place at short distances,  while superstring theory offers the
              exciting possibility of a  unified description of all basic interactions.  ***
