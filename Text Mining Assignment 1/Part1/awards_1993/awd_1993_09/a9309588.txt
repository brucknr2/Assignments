                  &  ABSTRACT                An international workshop on Head Driven Phase
              Structure Grammar (HPSG) will be held in conjunction with the 1993 Linguistic
              Institute, to be hosted by The Linguistics Department of the Ohio State
              University, sponsored by the Linguistic Society of America, and cosponsored by
              the Association for Computational Linguistics and the American Association for
              Artificial Intelligence. The dates of the workshop, July 19 August 6, 1993,
              coincide with the last three weeks of the Linguistic Institute.  The objectives
              of the workshop are:           (1) To exchange scientific results attained by
              researchers             using HPSG and closely related frameworks to develop   
                         precise and comprehensive descriptions of diverse human         
              languages.           (2) To share ideas, techniques, and tools relevant to the 
                          development of large scale computer implementation of             
              HPSG.           (3) To lay the groundwork for better dissemination of          
                     relevant future research ideas. ***
