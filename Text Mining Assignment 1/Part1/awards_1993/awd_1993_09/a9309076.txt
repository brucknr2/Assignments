              RIA:  An Object-Oriented Extensible View System for Computer-                  
              Aided Design Applications                                                      
                                                                                             
              Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems typically use an object-                   
              oriented database (OODB) to integrate diverse design data into                 
              one repository accessed by all design tools.  Such a central                   
              database is a critical bottleneck preventing the extensibility of              
              the CAD system over time, and forcing all design tools to work on              
              the same (comprehensive and hence extremely complex) data model.               
              Clearly, there is a conflict between supplying design tools with               
              customized design representations and integrating design data                  
              into one uniform model.  This research effort addresses this                   
              problem by extending OODB technology by two advanced features:                 
              (1) design views and (2) schema change support.  To support                    
              customized design representations, mechanisms to manage                        
              individualized tool interfaces of the CAD database are being                   
              implemented (which free individual design tools from having to                 
              maintain mappings between the global data model and local design               
              views). To support the extensibility of the CAD system, the view               
              system will be augmented with schema change functionality. It is               
              this unique integration of both capabilities that makes the                    
              Object-Oriented Extensible View System (OOEVS) a radically new                 
              tool for supporting CAD applications. Extensive experiments will               
              be performed to evaluate OOEVS and its application for building                
              complex software systems (in particular, CAD systems).  The                    
              proposed research is significant in that it provides a solution                
              to the important problem of CAD tool integration and extends                   
              state-of-the-art databases with powerful functionalities.
