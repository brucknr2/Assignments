Abstract    :
              Robert Ofoli  Abstract    The objective of this project is to use total internal
              reflection  flourescence (TIRF) to study the adsorption of proteins at the 
              liquid-liquid interface.  TIRF provides the ability to selectively  excite
              species at or near an interface, and enables one to quantify  the adsorption
              and desorption kinetics.    Specific aspects of the project include adaptation
              of the standard  experimental protocol used with TIRF at the solid-liquid
              interface  to extend its application at the liquid-liquid interface, 
              development of a calibration technique for quantifying adsorption  at the
              liquid-liquid interface, and equilibrium adsorption of  several proteins.  The
              TIRF experimental setup will utilize a  inverted microscope, a 5 W continuous
              wave ion argon laser, and  standard photometry.    The adaptation of TIRF to
              the liquid-liquid interface provides a  new tool that may be used to elucidate
              important liquid-liquid  interfacial phenomena.  While fundamental in nature,
              the study is  clearly of both scientific and technological significance,and 
              should help advance scientific understanding of protein adsorption  and
              interactions at the liquid-liquid interface.  ***
