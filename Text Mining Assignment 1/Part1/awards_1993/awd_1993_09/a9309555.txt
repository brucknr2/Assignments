Abstract    :
              9309555  Grober          Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a decapeptide
              that  was isolated from brain in 1971 and has now been shown to exist in  at
              least five different multiple forms.  Further, with the  development of
              sophisticated antibody technology, the GnRH neuronal  network was demonstrated
              to be a complex, heterogenous system,  comprising three or more distinct
              neuronal groups and spanning  vastly different regions of the brain.  While it
              is known that GnRH  is involved in the control of reproductive behavior and
              physiology  in all vertebrates, specific functions for the different GnRH 
              peptides within the different brain regions have yet to be  identified.  Dr.
              Grober will examine a vertebrate that exhibits  exceptional levels of sexual
              plasticity as his model system, thus  providing an excellent opportunity to
              investigate how social  interactions can trigger profound behavioral and
              physiological  changes via the endocrine system.  He will combine molecular, 
              cellular and field endocrinological techniques to determine the  role of GnRH
              in sexual plasticity.  Dr. Grober will examine the  relationship between GnRH
              gene expression and changes in physiology  and behavior.  He will show where
              and how much GnRH is formed and  under what conditions.  This integrative
              approach coupled with an  unique model system will provide important insights
              into the role  that GnRH plays in basic mechanisms underlying reproductive 
              maturation, physiology and behavior.   ***
