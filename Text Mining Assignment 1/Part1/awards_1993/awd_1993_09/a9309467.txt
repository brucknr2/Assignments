Abstract    :
              9309467  Whitmire      This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              Program will   assist the Department of Chemistry at Rice University in the
              purchase of    high resolution Mass Spectrometer .  This new instrumentation
              will   enhance greatly research in a number of  areas including the following: 
                1)  The chemistry of C60 and the higher fullerenes,  2)  Synthetic and
              structural investigations of the catalytic formation of   C-C bonds, the use of
              new thermal or photochemical cycloadditions and the   development of new
              syntheses of nitrogenous substances,  3)  The formation of nitrogen- and
              carbon-centered radicals from   azoalkanes,  4)  The use of mass spectrometry
              in the total synthesis of complex   natural products,  5)  The biosynthesis of
              natural products,  6)  Chemistry of the heavy main group elements.    This
              instrument will replace two old mass spectrometers, one purchased in   1969 and
              one purchased in 1975.    %%%  The mass spectrometer is used to measure the 
              precise mass of molecular   ions.  The fragmentation pattern of the various
              ions present gives   information about the molecular structure of the parent
              molecules from   which the molecular ions evolved.  Such information is
              essential for any   modern program of chemical synthesis.  ***
