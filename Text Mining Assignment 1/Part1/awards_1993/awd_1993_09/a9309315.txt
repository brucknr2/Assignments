Abstract    :
              Kubichek         Developing effective automatic, or objective techniques for 
              assessing speech quality to replace human listener scores (i.e.,  subjective
              quality) has been the object of much research.   Current algorithms base
              quality estimates on input-to-output  distortion measures.  A related, yet
              almost unexplored problem,  is estimation of transmission quality using only
              received speech  without access to the transmitted speech record (Output-Based 
              Quality or OBQ).  A second problem is objectively measuring  intelligibility
              using only received speech (Output-Based  Intelligibility or OBI).  This
              research addresses both of these  difficult problems, and is based on recently
              developed  technologies that utilize models of hearing perception to provide 
              speaker-independent speech recognition.         OBQ and OBI estimates are being
              determined from carefully  designed distance measures between Perceptual Linear
              Prediction  (PLP) coefficients of output speech and cluster centroids derived 
              from training data.  A PLP analysis system is being implemented.   Methods for
              estimating OBQ and OBI estimates are being developed.   Finally, the algorithms
              are being tested on a variety of speech  databases.  Statistical analyses will
              characterize their  performance in terms of their correlation with subjective
              results  and robustness to speaker and distortion variation.
