Abstract    :
              9309711 Crosby  This is a standard award for Research Initiation to investigate
              the relationships between individual characteristics of students and their
              performance as they search documents of varying levels of complexity. 
              Dependent variables in this study include eye fixations, comprehension tasks,
              and time on task.  Independent variables will be measurements of the
              differences between individual students.  The objective of this research is to
              investigate how humans differentially locate information from a computer screen
              and utilize this information to answer questions.  Results from this research
              should provide insight on how to best address searching tasks, and in
              particular whether to concentrate on designing interfaces that adapt to the
              user's cognitive style or to teach users how to best carry out a search, or
              both.              ` `                        h h #        (        -    p p 2
