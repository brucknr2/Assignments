Abstract    :
              This project relates to sustained                                              
              interarea oscillations.  The                                                   
              elimination of these oscillations,                                             
              when they occur, is of great                                                   
              practical importance.  The analysis                                            
              proposed here extends the notion of                                            
              linear analysis by including                                                   
              second-order nonlinear terms,                                                  
              which, with sinusoidal modes gives                                             
              rise to an array of added                                                      
              frequencies.  The analysis is to be                                            
              validated using standard simulation                                            
              techniques.
