Abstract    :
              Galatsanos         The research is exploring a novel, multi-channel approach to 
              the image restoration problem that utilizes a wavelet-based  subband
              decomposition. Such a decomposition facilitates the  incorporation of localized
              space-variant statistics and prior  knowledge into the restoration process as
              well as adaptive noise  suppression at various resolution levels.  Furthermore,
              it can be  implemented in a practical and computationally efficient manner.    
                  In order to fully exploit the potential advantages of this  approach, three
              classes of multi-channel restoration algorithms  are being considered:  1.    
              stochastic restoration algorithms where the multi-channel  statistics of the
              wavelet-based subbands are used to model the  space-varying nature of the
              original image;  2.     deterministic algorithms where multi-channel
              regularization  operators and parameters are used; and  3.     hierarchical
              image restoration where the image is  progressively restored starting from its
              coarse features and  continuing to the finer ones.
