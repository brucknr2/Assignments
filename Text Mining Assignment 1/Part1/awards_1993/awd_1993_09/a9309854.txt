Abstract    :
              9309854  Allen    This research concerns the basic theoretical question of how 
              traders can and should use information strategically.  The economic  motivation
              is derived from information sharing among firms in an  oligopolistic industry
              or a research joint venture as well as from  the fundamental problem of how
              groups of people choose policy  rules, contracts, legal systems, or
              institutions.  Information  provides a natural restriction on the
              enforceability of agreements.   The project begins by examining such
              interactions among individuals  with different information and the
              possibilities for solutions  which reflect, for instance, their average
              marginal contributions,  the impossibility for subgroups to find better
              outcomes, or the  lack of improvement arising from any unilateral change of
              action in  equilibrium.  An application to transfer pricing or cost sharing 
              among units (for example, subsidiaries in a corporation) sharing a  joint
              activity (i.e., a scientific laboratory or staff department  services) is
              provided.    ***
