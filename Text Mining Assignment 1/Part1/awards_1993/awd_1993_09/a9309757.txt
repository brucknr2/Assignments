Abstract    :
              9309757 Marsh An option included in current seismic retrofit programs of poorly
              confined reinforced concrete columns in older bridges is to leave the plastic
              hinging region just above the foundation of multiple column bents
              unretrofitted.  It is based on the assumption that the flexural strength of
              such columns will degrade quickly in response to inelastic demands and thus
              will not transmit much moment to the foundation.  It is also assumed that the
              shear capacity at the plastic hinge region will not be lost.  However, the
              state of knowledge regarding the mechanism of shear strength loss is poor.  The
              purpose of the proposed research is to assess the shear transfer capacity of
              such columns.  The proposed work involves the testing of 10 reduced scale
              reinforced concrete columns.  A range of potential configurations would be
              tested so that the specific conditions under both the flexural and shear
              capacities are lost could be identified.  The proposed work would provide
              essential information regarding the performance of unretrofitted, seismically
              deficient bridge elements, and would help in the rational prioritization of
              resource allotment for seismic retrofitting of poorly designed bridges. ***
