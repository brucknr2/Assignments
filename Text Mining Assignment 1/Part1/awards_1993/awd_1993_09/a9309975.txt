Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the Conference on Econometrics and Mathematical                 
              Economics (CEME) is to stimulate discussion and research on the                
              frontiers of econometric and mathematical economic theory and                  
              methodology and to apply advanced mathematical, statistical, and               
              numerical analysis techniques in empirical economic studies.  It               
              tries to encourage research on new topics and to speed the                     
              dissemination of the latest findings of leading scholars.  CEME                
              accomplishes these goals through seminar groups. These seminars                
              provide informal channels of communication for specialists in                  
              selected topic areas at widely dispersed institutions to meet                  
              periodically and for longer periods than is generally possible at              
              meetings of professional societies and at sporadic conferences.                
              There are currently active seminar groups in general equilibrium               
              models, decentralized economic planning, comparison of                         
              econometric models, Bayesian econometrics and time series                      
              analysis.  A new seminar series on microeconometrics will be                   
              formed to address the methodological issues arising in the                     
              econometric analysis of microeconomic models with cross-sectional              
              or panel data.  Since CEME's inception in 1970, its seminar                    
              groups have produced more than 850 working papers and have                     
              published many books and numerous articles in professional                     
              journals.
