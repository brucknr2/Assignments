Abstract    :

                This research addresses the task of finding the optimal control  policy for
              complex, nonlinear, and uncertain systems, given a set  of control objectives.
              The majority of effort so far in intelligent  control systems has been focused
              on implementation or function  approximation for complex, nonlinear, and
              uncertain systems.  It is  assumed a priori that the given training information
              best satisfies  the control objectives without a direct attempt to find the
              optimal  system control policy with respect to the control objectives.  
              Conventional optimal control methods are either limited to systems  that are
              amenable to mathematical analysis or else involve enormous  amounts of
              computation in the form of dynamic programming.  Intelligent control approaches
              that address the task of determining  the optimal control policy use the same
              basic strategy as dynamic  programming, only in less structured form.  This
              includes Back-  propagation Through Time (BTT) methods and systems that employ 
              reinforcement learning or adaptive critics.  This research project  uses a
              computationally efficient means of dynamic programming based  on a cell state
              space approach that makes it possible to do  multiple iterations of the
              algorithm in realistic time scales.   These methods will be applied to the
              six-degree-of-freedom flight  control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles under
              development at  Florida Atlantic University. One application of these AUVs is a
               joint effort between the University of South Florida's Marine  Science
              Department and FAU to perform a set of long range  oceanographic surveys in the
              Gulf of Mexico to determine bottom  composition and water quality. Because
              underwater vehicles can move  freely in three dimensions in relatively
              uncluttered environments,  the immediate potential for valuable contributions
              by autonomous  robotic systems may be even greater in the ocean than on land.
