Abstract    :
              9309082  Fried  The purpose of this research is to study the effects of
              transition  kinetics, spatially localized interactions between phases, and bulk
               energy and stress in determining the morphology of mircostructures  resulting
              from mechanically induced phase transitions in  martensitic alloys.  This
              research will be conducted within the  framework of a continuum theory and will
              involve both mathematical  analysis and scientific computation.
