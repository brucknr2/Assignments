Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant provides renewed support for the semi-annual                        
              Universities' Research Conference (URC) in Cambridge,                          
              Massachusetts.  This conference series provides the occasion for               
              formal and informal discussions for researchers who otherwise                  
              might have little opportunity to interact with other specialists               
              in their fields.  A special emphasis is placed on involving less               
              established scholars, women and minorities.  Conference topics                 
              are chosen for their relevance to current economic policy                      
              discussions as well as their interest to academic economists.                  
              Recent conferences have focused on economics of the environment,               
              labor markets and financial institutions and instability.  The                 
              spring 1993 meeting will focus on cooperation, coordination and                
              collusion among firms.  Papers for presentation at the                         
              conferences are solicited from over 70 economics departments and               
              50 business schools.  Conference organizers are careful to select              
              a mix of established and less well known researchers.  Special                 
              emphasis is also placed on including women and minorities.                     
              Discussants and other conference participants are also chosen to               
              encourage interaction among economists with similar interests at               
              different universities.  A typical conference includes 7 to 10                 
              papers and about 80 participants from 40 different universities.
