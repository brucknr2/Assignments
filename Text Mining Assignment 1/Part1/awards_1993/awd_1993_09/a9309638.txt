Abstract    :
              A hybrid high-power electronic                                                 
              switching module will be developed                                             
              from a combination of discrete power                                           
              devices, such as SCRs and FETs, with                                           
              the goal of improving the                                                      
              performance above that of any                                                  
              monolithic power switch.  The                                                  
              potential for improvement seems real                                           
              since each aspect of the switching                                             
              cycle, i.e. off, turn-on, on, turn-                                            
              off, may be optimized separately.                                              
              The project will start by designing,                                           
              operating and analyzing several                                                
              modest- power prototype switching                                              
              modules.  In the following phase an                                            
              attempt will be made to scale up to                                            
              the 50-100 kW power level.  At this                                            
              level a number of large-scale                                                  
              industrial facilities are locally                                              
              available.  A very positive feature                                            
              of this project is the U.S. Army                                               
              Pulse Power Center collaboration                                               
              through an existing Cooperative                                                
              Research and Development Agreement                                             
              (CRDA).  The research area,                                                    
              particularly in connection with ac                                             
              motor drives, is of great importance                                           
              in improving manufacturing                                                     
              efficiency and capability.
