Abstract    :
                   This research is aimed at developing on-line identification               
              and adaptive control strategies for food extrusion.  A twin-screw              
              food extruder will be used.  A general process model structure will            
              be determined in the form of auto-regressive moving-average model              
              with auxiliary inputs.  Multi-variable self-tuning regulator                   
              algorithms will be developed for regular operations based on the               
              generalized predictive control technique.  Model reference adaptive            
              control algorithms will be developed for transient operations.                 
                   This research is one of the very first applications of                    
              adaptive control in food processes.  It is also among the first                
              applications of multi-variable identification and adaptive control             
              theories in a real process.  The aim is to advance the theories                
              and enrich the adaptive control literature.  It can significantly              
              improve the extrusion process and the quality of numerous foods.               
              It may introduce new technologies to the manufacturing industry.
