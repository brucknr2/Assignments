Abstract    :
              9309902  Yuan       Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will 
              include two areas of vital importance in understanding the basic  interactions.
               The first concerns the origins of masses of the  fundamental particles.  The
              second concerns the interactions of  the heaviest of these particles. 
              Phenomenological implications  of various scenarios relevant to these two
              questions are  clarified.  The research is important for experiments at
              existing  facilities, and those planned for upcoming facilities.  It is 
              crucial for testing our understanding of the forces that exist  among
              elementary particles.  ***
