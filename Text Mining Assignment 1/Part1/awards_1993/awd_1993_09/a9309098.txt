Abstract    :
              9309098  Varvarigos  Communication efficiency is the key to the broad success of
               massively parallel computation.  One can see that by looking at  the success
              stories of parallel computation, which are currently  limited to applications
              that have small communication  requirements, or use a small number of
              processors.  In order to  use massively parallel computation for a broader
              range of  applications efficient algorithms to execute the underlying inter 
              processor communications have to be developed.  The objective of  this research
              is to create a library of algorithms to execute a  number of generic
              communication tasks in several multiprocessor  topologies.  Communication tasks
              and traffic patterns that arise  often in applications will be examined. 
              Emphasis will be given  to finding easily implementable communication
              algorithms to  execute these tasks in optimal or near-optimal time.  These 
              algorithms can be called as communication primitives by the  programmer of the
              compiler of a multiprocessor computer in the  same way that subroutines
              implementing standard functions are  called from a library of functions in a
              conventional computer.  ***
