Abstract    :
              9309405  Davis    This research concerns the effectiveness of decision making by
               small groups such as committees and panels.  Enhancing the  productivity of
              groups often involves encouraging consensus,  promoting discussion, publicizing
              member views, etc.  The validity  and efficiency of such measures have rarely
              been studied and  unanticipated side-effects and not been considered.  The
              empirical  research in this project involves an orderly assessment of the 
              influence of various procedural mechanisms and how they effect the  final
              outcomes or decisions of the group.  The decisions at issue  will be ordinary
              judgments similar to those expected of citizens  serving on a civil jury or
              schoolboard.  Although the experimental  results should assist in achieving of
              long-term goal of improving  group efficiency and accuracy, a more basic
              research issue is how  and why the various procedural mechanisms work as they
              do.  A  formal model is being developed to predict group consensus on 
              quantitative judgments.  The data from the experiments will be used  to test
              the model and guide its further development.  The model  should provide
              additional insight into group decision processes and  its enhancement.  ***
