Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT --- CTS-9309561  This proposal deals with the application of analytical
              and experimental techniques to Self Propagating High Temperature Synthesis
              (SHS) in the presence of external forces.  Two types of modes of application of
              the force are proposed to be investigated:  uniaxial and centrifugal pressing. 
              The specific goals of this study include the understanding of simultaneous
              combustion and densification, phase separation and interfacial interactions. 
              Analytical relationships are to be developed to describe the simultaneous
              effects of combustion and densification.  A strategy is envisioned for the
              design and scale-up of the process to synthesize and densify simultaneously.
