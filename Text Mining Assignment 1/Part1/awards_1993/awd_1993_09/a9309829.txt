Abstract    :
              9309829  Woodward  We propose to develop a high-order Godunov code or 2-D and
              3-D  ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) problems.  We will implement this  code on
              a variety of high performance computers, with particular  emphasis on massively
              parallel sustems like the 544-node CM-5  Connection Machine available to us at
              the University of  Minnesota.  The major ingredients for this new code are
              already  in place.  The work which remains is to build these elements into  an
              efficient code suitable for solving grand challenge problems  of both a basic
              research and of a practical nature.
