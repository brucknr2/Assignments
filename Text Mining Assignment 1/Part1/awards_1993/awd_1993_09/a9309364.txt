Abstract    :
              9309364  Achucarro       Research in theoretical astrophysics will be concerned 
              with the existence of large scale structures in cosmology.  Such structures can
              be described by certain solutions of  quantum field theory, and this research
              will clarify their  geometrical properties.  The research will be important for
               a better understanding of the past and future evolution of  the universe.  ***
