              RIA:  Formalization, Inference, and Query Processing of Spatial                
              Relations in Geographic Space                                                  
                                                                                             
              Scientists and engineers using geographic databases need query                 
              languages with powerful spatial selection methods and capabilities             
              to infer spatial information in a manner similar to a human expert.            
              Crucial for geographic databases and geographic information systems            
              (GISs), containing very large amounts of spatial data, are                     
              appropriate operators to access and manipulate spatial data in                 
              large-scale, geographic space, far beyond what is currently being              
              offered by traditional database management systems.  The objective             
              of the investigations is to construct a coherent reasoning system              
              that integrates spatial concepts about topology, cardinal                      
              directions, and approximate distances so that they can serve as a              
              spatial extension to geographic databases and query languages.  The            
              reasoning system focuses on large-scale, geographic space.  The                
              hypothesis is that powerful and complex spatial reasoning can be               
              formalized as the product of the interaction between relatively                
              simple spatial relations with specific inference rules.  Individual            
              spatial relations about topology, distance, and direction are                  
              formalized and integrated into a comprehensive system, adding more             
              power through the coexistence of the different relationships in a              
              single system.  The major result will be a set of primitives, with             
              rules describing their combinations, for the design of domain                  
              specific query languages for GISs.
