Abstract    :
              9309574  Azizoglu  The Principal Investigator is addressing the research issues
              in  designing mulitiple access schemes for wide area all-optical  networks. 
              The objective is to produce an analytical framework  that provides efficient
              channel access taking the optical device  constraints into consideration.  Such
              constraints include the  physical characteristics and limitations of optical
              devices, such  as the tuning speed of lasers and filters, laser phase noise,
              and  fiber dispersion.  Frequency and Code Division Multiple Access  schemes
              are considered as two special cases of a general access  scheme where both
              frequency and code concurrency are employed.   The analytical methodology being
              developed will evaluate the  performance of the general scheme and find the
              optimal scheme for  a given network design goal.  The award provides support
              for  three years.
