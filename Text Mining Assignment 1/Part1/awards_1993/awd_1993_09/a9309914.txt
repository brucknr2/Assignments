Abstract    :
              Ilumoka         A high proportion of future integrated systems will contain 
              mixed analog/digital subsystems required to meet demanding  quality
              specifications.  CAD (computer-aided design) tools  currently available for
              integrated circuit (IC) quality  enhancement (or robust design) although
              effective are plagued by  the problem of high simulation cost, the greatest
              part of which  is due to circuit simulation and extraction of performance. 
              This  problem arises due to the fact that accurate prediction of  circuit
              performance requires that ICs be modeled at a number of  different levels of
              abstraction including process, layout, device  and circuit levels. 
              Furthermore, since current methodologies  simulate several instances of the IC
              in order to investigate  quality, the cost problem is compounded.         To
              date, research efforts to reduce simulation costs have  produced a number of
              approximation techniques which sacrifice  accuracy for reduction in
              computational cost.  Thus, although the  cost problem is ameliorated, simulator
              output has significant  error.  Artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide a
              non-  parametric method for mapping one set of data to another based on 
              information established during an adjustment procedure called  "training". 
              Research is focused on the study of improved robust  design techniques for
              MOSFET ICs which exploit the versatile  mapping capability of ANNs.
