Abstract    :
              9309100  Camps  This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The 
              research uses techniques from robust statistics coupled with a  Bayesian
              approach, to develop mathematical models for robust 3D  object recognition from
              uncertain 2D image data, and to develop  matching schemes that use these models
              to robustly recognize and  compute the pose of an object, while providing a
              measure of  confidence level for the hypothesis made.  The results should 
              enable development of computer vision systems that can cope with  imperfections
              in real input data, due for example to fragmentation  or sensor noise, without
              resorting to use of ad hoc heuristics or  trial-and-error procedures.  Such
              systems should offer more robust  performance and significant reductions in
              development cost.
