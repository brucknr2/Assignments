Abstract    :
              9309460  Cline    Nerve cells communicate with one another via a slender
              cellular process called an axon.  Each nerve cell, or neuron, has a very
              specific pattern of axonal connections, and normal function of the nervous
              system depends on this specific pattern of connections. Development of the
              proper pattern of connections in the brain requires a precise regulation of
              axonal branching in the vicinity of a neuron's target cells.  The long-term
              goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms that regulate axonal
              branching in the developing nervous system. Recent studies show that neurons
              grow by the continuous addition and retraction of branches.  An increase in
              axonal branching, such as that observed after activity is blocked, might occur
              through a decrease in the amount of branch retraction or an increase in the
              amount of branch addition.  To resolve this issue, it is necessary to
              continuously monitor the a living axon over time.  This can now be accomplished
              using laser scanning confocal microscopy.  This project will determine the
              temporal limits for modifications of axonal structure and test the hypothesis
              that blocking synaptic activity increases the rate of branch initiation.  These
              results will provide important new insights into the mechanisms responsible for
              nerve cell form and function.  ***     Z   \   ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m
