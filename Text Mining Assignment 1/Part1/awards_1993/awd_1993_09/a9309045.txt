Abstract    :
              This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is                 
              made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Rosina M. Georgiadis of                  
              the Chemistry Department, George Washington University.  An                    
              optical technique, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)                             
              spectroscopy, will be combined with in situ scanning probe                     
              microscopy to investigate the chemistry and dynamics of ultra                  
              thin films at metal/liquid interfaces.  The SPR method will be                 
              applied to the study of the process of monolayer film assembly                 
              at an interface, and will provide characterization of film                     
              structure and stability.  Work during the planning grant period                
              will concentrate on the construction of the SPR system and                     
              proof of method measurements on well-studied long chain thiol                  
              molecular layers.  The project will increase understanding of                  
              thin film growth and thus is of technologically relevant to a                  
              wide range of disciplines.
