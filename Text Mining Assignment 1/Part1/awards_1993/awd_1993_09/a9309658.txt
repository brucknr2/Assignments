Abstract    :
              Chamberlain         This research is on approaches to partitioning VLSI systems 
              for distributed simulation on multiprocessor architectures.  The  approach is
              to use knowledge of a VLSI system and the distributed  simulation algorithms to
              perform a partitioning and assignment of  system components to processors in a
              manner that minimizes the  execution time of the distributed simulation.
              Central to the  approach is an initial partitioning that is refined as 
              information is gathered about the simulation workload.  In this  way assignment
              of components to processors can take advantage of  measured data that is
              unknown (and therefore unavailable) prior  to the simulation run.  The approach
              has three phases:  1.     Algorithms for initial partitioning of the circuit 
              components are being developed;  2.     Means of assigning partitions to
              processors are being  developed; and  3.     Rules for migrating components
              from one processor to another  are being devised.
