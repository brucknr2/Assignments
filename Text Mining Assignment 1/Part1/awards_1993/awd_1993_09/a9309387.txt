Abstract    :
              9309387  Iglesias  Research is proposed on investigating a minimum entropy H-inf
               control problem for discrete-time, time-varying systems.  For  linear
              time-invariant systems, these controllers have shown to be  a very useful tool
              for designing practical controllers because they  provide a simple way of
              integrating the robustness of H-inf  controllers with the performance of linear
              quadratic Gaussian  optimal controllers.    The main theme of the proposed
              research is to use some very recent  developments in the representation of
              time-varying discrete-time  systems in order to develop a complete theory for
              several problems  in H-inf control for time-varying systems.  Part of the
              analysis  will include the recently introduced W-transform which is a 
              generalization of the usual Z- transform.  In addition to the  minimum entropy
              control problem, we will consider H-inf control for   time-varying systems
              defined over an infinite time interval, as  well as a modification of the H-inf
              control problem in which the  future time variations of the plant are not
              known.    The proposed research is expected to result in a new design 
              methodology for linear time-varying systems that has improved  performance as
              compared to the standard H-inf design, and improved  robustness as compared to
              the standard LQG design.  An additional  benefit of the proposed research is
              that the theory will strengthen  the interconnections between operator theory
              and H-inf control.  ***
