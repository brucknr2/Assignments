Abstract    :
              Chakrabarti         In the past, real-time image processing has been restricted 
              to low-level tasks such as filtering; the more complex medium and  high-level
              tasks have been left to general-purpose computers  which are unable to handle
              the large computation rates of these  tasks.  Real-time computation of these
              tasks thus necessitates  development of task-specific algorithms and
              architectures.  This  project is developing efficient algorithms and
              architectures for  an important and representative medium-level task:  motion 
              estimation of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional objects.  The  approach reduces
              the number of computations in motion estimation  by implementing it in the
              Hough space.  Specifically, the objects  are represented by peaks in the Hough
              space, and motion  parameters are extracted from shifts of these peaks.  To 
              facilitate real-time computation of Hough transforms, efficient  algorithms
              that reduce the size of the Hough transform parameter  space are being
              developed.  To keep the design costs low, these  algorithms are targeted to
              customized versions of a "base"  architecture:  a highly pipelined linear array
              of processors,  which has access to an array of memory banks.  Apart from 
              developing an efficient scheme for real-time motion estimation,  this research
              will also provide design guidelines for algorithm  and architecture development
              of other medium- and high-level  image processing tasks.
