Abstract    :
                   Computing Research is a very young research area.  In the                 
              past few years it has become clear that computation is joining                 
              experimentation and mathematical analysis, providing a basic new               
              scientific paradigm for how science gets done.  In such a new and              
              rapidly changing field, communication among researchers is                     
              particularly important.  However, the conference structure in                  
              computer science and engineering is highly fragmented and works                
              against such communication.  Important new research results are                
              seldom presented at broad based national meetings.  Consequently,              
              broad based meetings are seldom attended by active researchers.                
                                                                                             
              The Federated Computing Research Conference will address this                  
              problem.  This conference will retain the advantages of smaller                
              specialized meetings while at the same time facilitating                       
              communication among researchers in different subfields.                        
              Additional benefits of this meeting include:  (1) economies of                 
              scale, (2) providing an educational function for the public, (3)               
              stimulating new research.
