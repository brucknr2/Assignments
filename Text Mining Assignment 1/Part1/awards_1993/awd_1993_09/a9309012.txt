Abstract    :
              9309012  Segee  Sensor technology exist that is capable of detecting potentially
              dangerous gases even in very low concentrations.  However, these sensors are
              not very selective and often have responses that are nonlinear function of gas
              concentration.  Selectivity has been improved by using an array of sensors
              having differing sensitivities.  The mathematics of calibrating such an array
              is very complex and poor performance and even instability can result if the
              responses of individual sensors are too similar.  If its generally necessary to
              disregard valid sensor data from a subset of the available sensor.  To address
              the above problem artificial neural network models have been suggested as an
              alternative.   They are capable of learning multidimensional nonlinear
              functions, can exploit redundant information and are adaptable.  The proposed
              work will use data gathered form sensors in a controlled environment to train
              three different types of artificial neural networks to identify gas type and
              concentration.  Performance of these neural networks will be measured first by
              means of a test set gathered at the same time as the training data, but not
              used for training.  Ultimately, performance in situ will be measured and
              on-line training used to fine tune performance.  ***
