Abstract    :
                   The project requests funds for participation of 40 faculty                
              members from minority institutions to attend the 1993 National                 
              Educational Computing Conference (NECC'93) in Orlando, Florida,                
              June 27-30, 1993.  This is an extremely worthwhile endeavor which              
              expands on support CISE has previously provided for faculty from               
              minority institutions to attend conferences more technically                   
              directed to computer science and engineering.  The NECC provides a             
              broader view of computers in education focusing on the use of                  
              computers across all disciplines.  It is critical that faculty at              
              minority institutions attend national conferences of this type in              
              order to become better integrated into the research and education              
              communities.  This project represents a strong effort in that                  
              direction.
