Abstract    :
              9309349  Gaillard  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which
              is to gain a fundamental  understanding of the fate of trace metals in 
              freshwater sediments.  The investigator plans  on using an approach that
              involves both  experimental and mathematical modeling of the  problem,
              assessing the extent to which trace  metals could be buried permanently in 
              sediments or remobilized into overlying  waters under natural conditions.  The 
              experimental work involves determination of  trace metal distributions in
              interstitial  waters and bulk sediments and on the  measurement of trace metal
              binding to  sediment particles and authigenic particles.    The proposal
              leading to this award was  submitted in response to NSF 92-122, Research 
              Initiation Awards Program Announcement and  Guidelines.  Results are expected
              to provide  a more fundamental understanding than now  exists of phenomena that
              are associated with  the processes by which trace metal  constituents of
              sediments in lakes and  streams can pollute the overlying water.   This in turn
              can lead to an improvement in  predicting the behavior of trace metals in 
              sediments and potentially find application as  a prognostic tool for assessing
              the release  of metals from polluted sediments.
