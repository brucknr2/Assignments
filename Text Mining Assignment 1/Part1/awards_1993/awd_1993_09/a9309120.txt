Abstract    :
              Effective techniques to perform in-circuit reconfiguration for                 
              FPGAs may lead to a new generation of fault-tolerant computer                  
              systems for high reliability and high performance applications.                
              Future programmable computer architectures could allow software                
              running on the hardware platform to dynamically adjust the                     
              architecture according to the current task.                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with the diagnosis and reconfiguration              
              of re-programmable Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  In                 
              particular, the effort focuses on the design of FPGA interconnect              
              diagnosis algorithms, development of in-circuit reconfiguration                
              strategies for fault tolerance and change of functionality, and the            
              establishment of a theoretical framework for self-adjustable FPGA              
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Since an FPGA contains many connection wires and switches and                  
              requires a great amount of diagnosis time, especially if the                   
              diagnosis has to be done often, fast-diagnosis algorithm time                  
              implies a great saving in time and resources, and greater                      
              reliability.  Fast diagnosis algorithms will also benefit other                
              areas where interconnect diagnosis is important, such as VLSI, MCM             
              and PCB production.
