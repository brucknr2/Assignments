Abstract    :
              9309539  Barlow     The compound eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus, has been a
              model  system in visual research for decades.   The visual sensitivity of  the
              eyes of this animal undergo a million-fold change between  daytime and
              nighttime, controlled partly by an internal "circadian  clock" that enables the
              animal to see underwater in dim moonlight  as well as in bright sunlight.  This
              project involves a unique  approach with novel techniques in behavior and in
              neurophysiology.   The objectives are to investigate the visual behavior during
              day  and night, the activity patterns in the optic nerve in behaving  animals,
              and the neural coding that underlies "approach" behavior  to certain kinds of
              targets.  Behavioral techniques provide precise  measurements of what the
              animal can see and how well it can see  under different lighting levels. 
              Physiological techniques allow  recordings of optic nerve activity from
              behaving animals by both  tether and by sonar telemetry.  Studies are done on
              behavior and  physiology in the controlled environment of the laboratory and in
               the animal's natural habitat of the ocean, and data will be  incorporated into
              related studies on computational models of visual  processing.  Results will
              reveal concepts of how neural activity is  related to behavior, and will have
              impact not only on studies of  vision, but across many areas of neuroscience,
              with potential  further implications for artificial vision for robotics
              development  as well as for possible aids for low vision.  ***
