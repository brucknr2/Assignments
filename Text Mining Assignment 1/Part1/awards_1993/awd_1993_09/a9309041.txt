Abstract    :
              9309041  Yager  This award will fund research on the use of Raman-based 
              spectroscopy for use in fiber optic sensing of small  molecules, including
              anesthetics.  Two methods will be  evaluated to determine if they can enhance
              the Raman signal  so that sensing would be possible.  The first method will 
              employ elastomeric absorbents to concentrate small  hydrophilic molecules.  The
              second method will make use of  "photon ring" waveguides to produce the
              illumination.    This study has the potential not only to impact the 
              monitoring of general anesthetics but also it could prove  useful in remote
              environmental monitoring, industrial  process monitoring, and workspace
              monitoring.  The use of  the photon ring technology to improve the sensitivity
              of a  detector also could have an impact on the biosensor field.  ***
