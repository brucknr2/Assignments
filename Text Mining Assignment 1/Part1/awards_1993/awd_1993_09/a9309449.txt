Abstract    :
              9309449  Yin  This research project is directed  towards the development of a
              method  to simultaneously isolate and  characterize virus clones from a 
              heterogeneous population.  The  principle of the method stems from  recent
              theoretical results  suggesting virus strains can be  "fingerprinted" in a
              petri dish by  measuring the dependence of their  propagation rates on the
              density of  their host.  Embedded in the shape  and amplitude of a fingerprint
              are a  wealth of detailed information  reflecting a particular strain's 
              interaction with its host, i.e., its  adsorption rate, replication rate  and
              yield per infected host.  An  image acquisition and analysis  system is to be
              designed and built  to measure fingerprints.  ***
