Abstract    :
              9309847  Luu    With this Research Planning Grant, Dr. Luu will explore the 
              feasibility of using new infrared array spectrographs to determine  the
              compositions of comet nuclei and Trojan asteroids.  The  infrared technique
              should serve as a powerful probe of the  composition of primitive objects in
              the outer Solar System, and  provide a unique means to study the conditions and
              processes of the  early Solar System.
