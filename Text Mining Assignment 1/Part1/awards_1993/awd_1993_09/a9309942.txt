Abstract    :
              9309942  Pruitt      Escalation, which can be defined as change toward the use
              of more extreme tactics in conflict, is the source of the most important
              problems associated with conflict.  We know from prior research that heavy
              escalation is usually accompanied by changes in perceptions of self (or own
              group) and of the other party, leading to progressive worsening of relations
              between the parties and further escalation in the next conflict.  But the
              details of the conditions and processes that produce escalation are as yet
              unknown.    This project will develop a new, ecologically valid laboratory
              method for studying the escalation of social conflict and will test some
              hypotheses derived from a preliminary theory of escalation.  The new method,
              which has been successfully used in a preliminary study, corrects serious
              defects in past procedures for studying conflict.  The research is designed to
              reveal the structure of escalation, its immediate psychological antecedents,
              and some of the conditions producing it.    Two experiments will examine the
              effects of blaming the other party for persistent annoyance and relationships
              with that party.  The rest of the work will involve the development of
              measures.  New measures of escalation will be devised by having subjects rate
              the major tactics used to cope with the annoyance.  Subjects will also rate
              these tactics on three dimensions that are believed to influence choices among
              them:  effectiveness, normativeness, and likelihood of being resented.  A
              multiple regression analysis will assess the importance of the dimensions under
              various conditions.  Many psychological states wi ll also be measured.    The
              research will advance knowledge of one of the most destructive forces in human
              experience, helping to interpret -- and hopefully eventually to control -- such
              phenomena as spouse battering, urban riots, and armed conflict between nations.
