Abstract    :
                This project will study the effects involuntary resettlement on agricultural
              production in the Manatali region of western Mali where approximately 10,000
              people were relocated in 1986-87.  Now, 5-10 years afterwards, the people have
              passed through the early transition phase of adaptation to relocation and can
              use new resources for social an economic development.  The researchers
              hypothesize that the interplay of the process of involuntary relocation with
              the system of socio-economic stratification will affect the social division of
              labor, the major strategies of agricultural production, and hence levels of
              production.   The project will use intensive interview and participant
              observation to follow a sample of approximately 120 households to determine
              patterns of productive activities, access to productive resources, household
              division of labor, and levels of production.  It will be carried out by a team
              of four social scientists pairing the American principal investigator with
              social scientists from the Institut des Sciences Humanies (ISH) in Mali.  This
              team worked on the initial studies of this area in the late 1980s and by
              working together again on this re-study the team will provide an optimal way to
              gather information on changes over time.   At a theoretical level, this project
              will deepen our understanding of how rural stratification systems work in a
              territory where access to the major resource of land remains embedded in social
              and political control.  At an applied level, this greater understanding of
              rural stratification systems and their effects on agricultural production will
              allow planners to design more  equitable programs which allow people to produce
              in a more economically and environmental sustainable fashion.  This project
              will also increase the scientific capability of the ISH social scientists of
              Mali.  ***    d as to whether the proposed research would be as successful as
              anticipated.  Of greatest concern to the panelists was the relatively vague
              specification of methods and the absence of clear descriptions regarding how
              the methods related to the hypotheses that would be tested.  At the conclusion
              of its meeting, th
