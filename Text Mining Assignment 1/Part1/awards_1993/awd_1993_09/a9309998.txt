Abstract    :
              This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop                  
              custom devices for persons with musculoskeletal or neurological                
              disorders.  The students will work with an institution providing               
              care and training for the targeted population.  Ten projects per               
              year will be undertaken by the group and reports on the completed              
              projects will be included in a publication that will detail the                
              projects completed at all institutions participating in this                   
              project.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This type of experience is important since not only will it                    
              provide meaningful projects for the engineering students to                    
              complete as part of their education, but it will also benefit a                
              population where customization is usually required of many                     
              rehabilitation devices.
