Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to develop and analyze an                    
              algorithm for the application of Newton's Method to the problem                
              of finding points on an algebraic variety when the defining                    
              equations are known, and to apply the algorithm to aid research                
              on problems in pure mathematics.
