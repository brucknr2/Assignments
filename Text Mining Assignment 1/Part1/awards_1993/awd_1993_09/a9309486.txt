Abstract    :
              9309486  Acar  As part of this proposal, an  optimal controller based on 
              artificial neural networks will be  developed for a class of nonlinear 
              systems. The Proposed controller  will be capable of adapting and  optimizing a
              receding horizon  quadratic cost function in real  time for a system which has
              unknown  nonlinearities in its state   variables.  The complete controller 
              design will consist of various  stages of modeling the  nonlinearities,
              estimating future  values of the system states,  designing a critic for the
              cost,  and learning the optimal control in  real time.  All these stages of the
               controller design will involve  various types of neural networks  which may
              utilize different forms  of supervised learning methods  integrated with the
              control  problem.  Briefly the objectives of  this work are as follows.  
              developing and simulating a real-  time optimal controller based on  neural
              networks.  Comparing its  performance with the (off-line)  optimal controller
              and two other  neural network based variations.   Obtaining some stability
              bounds (or  attraction regions) of the neural  network controlled system 
              experimentally and analytically.   Implementing the controller on the  two
              hardware experiments in the  Neuro-Controller Laboratory at the  University of
              Missouri-Rolla.  ***
