Abstract    :
              9309333  Rothkopf  Standard models of auctions need enrichment in order to be 
              applied in realistic contexts.  Many common but neglected factors  invalidate
              prescriptions of auction theory and alter the  evaluation of the economic
              performance of auction markets.  This  research augments bidding theory in some
              realistic directions and  explicates the divergence between theoretical
              predictions and  long-standing practices in many auction markets.  One thrust
              of  the research will examine information transmission from bidders  to
              auctioneer during the course of an English auction, and how  the extent of the
              interception of this information by rival  bidders affects strategies and
              equilibrium outcomes.  A second  effort will incorporate explicitly several
              realistic aspects of  cheating and rule bending in auction models.  A third
              effort  introduces serious study of the incentives in franchise bidding  for
              management of natural resources.  The sum of these efforts is  intended to play
              a key role in enhancing the understanding of  actual choices under market
              exchange rules and bidding  strategies.  ***
