Abstract    :
              9309164  Williamson  The Cliometric Conference series continues to serve as an 
              important means for encouraging research in economic history and  as forum for
              disseminating new methods, findings, and  interpretations among historians as
              well as economists.  A  special effort is made to include the work of graduate
              students  and assistant professors representing a broad range of  specialties,
              but with increasing emphasis on twentieth century  problems.  The scientific
              results of the cliometric history  movement have been impressive and promise to
              be equally important  in the years ahead.  The 1994 meeting is scheduled to be
              held in  May at the University of Arizona.  The 1995 and 1966 Conferences  well
              be held at other sites to be selected from other  Universities  offering to
              host the conferences.  ***
