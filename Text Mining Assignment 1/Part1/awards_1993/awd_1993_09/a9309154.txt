Abstract    :
              9309154  Sennott  The objective is the characterization and computation of
              optimal  policies for the minimization of the average cost per unit time.  Such
              policies enable complex systems to be efficiently  controlled.  Markov decision
              chains with countable state spaces  are studied. Know axioms guarantee the
              existence of average cost  optimal stationary policies.  It will be determined
              whether these  policies are also optimal under additional criteria, and when 
              they may be computed by value iteration.  In addition, the  adaptive control
              case when certain system parameters are unknown  will be treated.  An important
              result of the research will be the   development of an algorithm for the
              computation of optimal  policies when the state space is denumerably infinite. 
              The  existence and computability of controls will be shown for a new  class of
              stochastic control problems under a variety of average  cost criteria.  These
              extensions will have direct applicability  to queuing systems, multiple-access
              communications, and vehicle  control   ***
