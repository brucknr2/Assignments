Abstract    :
              9309422  Fadem    Sex differences in reproductive behavior in mammals are 
              determined not only by the genes and by hormones produced in  adulthood, but
              also by steroid hormones secreted by the gonads  during perinatal development. 
              Although it is known that  testicular androgens play an important role during
              perinatal  development, androgens are metabolized into estrogens within CNS 
              target cells.  Determining whether an androgen or its  estrogenic metabolite is
              the differentiating hormone is  complicated since placental mammalian fetuses
              have systems which  actually "protect" them from maternal estrogen.  Thus,
              getting  estrogen to the fetus and quantifying the amount of estrogen  acting
              on the fetus is extremely important yet almost impossible  to achieve.  Dr.
              Fadem has developed a marsupial model to examine  the role of estrogen.  The
              newborns are born at a developmental  stage equivalent to that of a 13-day
              fetal rat or 8-week human  embryo.  Hence, much of the fetal development occurs
              outside the  body of the mother, making the fetal environment accessible in 
              these mammals.  Dr. Fadem will manipulate the hormonal  environment of the
              newborn marsupials.  She will assess the  effects of these early manipulations
              on reproductive and  aggressive behavior, morphology and physiology in
              adulthood.    The results from these studies will contribute to a better 
              understanding of various human disorders that result from  insufficient or
              excess hormone exposure during sexual  differentiation.   ***
