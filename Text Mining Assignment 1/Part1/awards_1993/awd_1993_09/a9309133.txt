                       This research examines the social and technological factors that lead
              people using computer based information to share information and solve
              problems.  It also addresses some design questions about new technologies and
              group work.  Conflicting results from the research on computer mediated group
              decision making are particularly troublesome, not because they exist, but
              because they are not empirically examined.  One stream of research suggests
              that computer networks "open up" communication and ease coordination in some
              tasks.  A second stream of research suggests that computer communication makes
              it difficult to regulate interaction and reach consensus.  The same technology
              apparently results in different group behaviors, depending on the kind of task
              that is performed.  The research proposed here will attempt to explore these
              task and media effects empirically.  Using theories from social psychology and
              group interaction, a series of experiments will be conducted to test the
              implication that computer supported group work may best be suited for
              divergent, information sharing tasks, but not well suited for convergent,
              consensus rea ching tasks.  These studies focus particularly on how the
              distribution of shared and unshared information affects the way in which groups
              exchange information and solve problems in face to face and computer mediated
              group decision making.  They also replicate and extend previous work on first
              advocacy and status effects to examine the effects of unshared information on
              expert behavior in groups.
