              wide bandgap semiconductor which is of interest for use in blue  light emitting
              diodes and lasers, which are important for applications in compact disk
              readonly memones (CD ROM's), high definition video displays, and secured
              underwater commumcations.  In recent months, pulsed operation of zinc selenide
              based semiconductor blue lasers  has been demonstrated at temperatures up to
              250 K. Higher performance, namely  continuous laser operation at room
              temperature, is desirable but has not been achieved due  to the difficulties in
              obtaining stable, low resistivity p type ZnSe and low resistance ohmic 
              contacts to n  and p type ZnSe. Due to these difficulties, the blue lasers
              which have been  fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to date have large
              forward voltage drops (15 30V) and also excessive power dissipation.  We plan
              to develop ZnSe blue lasers using organometallic vapor phase epitaxy  (OMVPE),
              with an emphasis on the development of low resistivity p type ZnSe and
              lowresistance ohmic contacts. P doped ZnSe will be produced by nitrogen doping
              from the  novel alkyl sources, trimethylamine, triethylamine, and
              triisopropanolamine. Low resistance ohmic contacts will be fabricated using a
              unique approach based on gradedbandgap alloys of HgZnSe. ZnSe based laser
              structures will be fabricated using ZnSe/Znl_  xCdxSe/ZnSe single quantum wells
              and the techniques described above. ***
