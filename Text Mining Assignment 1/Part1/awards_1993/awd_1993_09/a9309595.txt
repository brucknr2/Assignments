Abstract    :
              9309595  Sloan    This projects concerns phase equilibrium studies for systems 
              containing water and hydrocarbons at intermediate and high  pressures and
              temperatures in the vicinity of the ice point  where hydrates are formed.  In
              particular, this project  investigates sH hydrates.    A statistical
              thermodynamic model for sH phase equilibria using  van der Waals' and
              Platteeuw's (1959) model is proposed.  In a  parallel, feedback model with
              model development , the project  investigates such a model via sH phase
              equilibria measurements  of large molecules like those of interest to the
              hydrocarbon  industry (in Items B and C above) but with a second smaller 
              molecule, Xe, and with CH4 both above and below the ice point.     The
              investigators plan to use the model to generate an entire  model phase diagram
              for multiphase fluid-hydrate equilibrium,  via analogs to our previous phase
              diagram work on other hydrate  structures.    The model will be tested against
              unusual conditions of the phase  diagram, for example with measured
              co-existence points of  sH+sI+gas+H2O+liquid hydrate phase equilibria,
              obviating the  need for many years of experimental research, analogous to that 
              done on sI and sII hydrates since their 1934 discovery in  pipelines.  ***
