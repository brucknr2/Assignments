Abstract    :
              9309345  Muhunthan  The objective of this research is to develop a new technique
               based on simulation, aimed at building models of real porous  media.  On the
              basis of measurements of characteristics made  using thin sections of porous
              media at the microstructural level,  an artificial medium that has the same
              average geometric  properties as the original medium will be created.  The 
              permeability tensor will be obtained by solving the field  equation numerically
              in a sample of three-dimensional  reconstructed soil medium.  the results will
              be compared with  experimental data.  The possibility of determing the
              permeability  tensor by direct observations on thin sections will be also 
              investigated.  ***
