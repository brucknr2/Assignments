Abstract    :
                Gekelman  The project will carry out a laboratory study of Alfven waves and 
              their interaction with plasma particles-a set of physical  processes of major
              importance in solar and space physics-through  the use of the new large linear
              plasma device at UCLA and modern  optical laser induced fluorescence techniques
              developed at  Colorado.  The goals of the project are to explore and begin to 
              understand dissipation, resonance, heating and wave-induced  transport through
              which Alfven waves are damped by and coupled to  the plasma medium.
