Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research investigates how cooperating agents in real-world                
              domains can select the most useful information to communicate to               
              others.  The research focuses on communication between agents in               
              distributed systems performing complex, problem-solving tasks.                 
              Here, only partial knowledge of other agents is available, and                 
              agents have limited computational resources for communication.  To             
              address these constraints, the researchers will examine how an                 
              agent's knowledge of its own use of information can indicate the               
              value of that information to other agents.  Heuristics will be                 
              developed to evaluate the usefulness of a given piece of                       
              information based on how that information is used or inferred as an            
              agent performs its problem-solving task.  These heuristics will be             
              integrated into the communication system for AUV's that is being               
              developed at the University of New Hampshire.  The research will               
              contribute to the ability of AUV's to work together, as well as                
              providing insights into how other distributed systems and natural              
              language interfaces can select useful information to communicate.//
