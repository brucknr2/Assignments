Abstract    :
              Chaudhary         This project explores a new scheme for achieving load 
              balancing in a heterogeneous distributed computing system.  With  the advent of
              optical links it is now feasible to migrate tasks  from one computer to a
              remote computer.  This scheme is being  implemented and tested using real-world
              problems in a real  heterogeneous distributed computing environment.  A salient
               feature of the scheme is its semi-distributed, adaptive nature,  i.e., the
              parameters taken into consideration and the algorithm  for load balancing
              itself change during run time.  The algorithm  is stable, i.e., no processes
              are allowed to migrate without  making any progress.  No assumptions are made
              about the  dependency relations of the various tasks.  Various job classes 
              with precedence constraints are allowed.  Other important real-  world
              constraints such as the inability of a process to execute  on particular
              computers, a process needing more than one computer  simultaneously for its
              execution, a set of processes needing to  be executed on a particular subset of
              computers, etc., are also  incorporated into the scheme.  The scheme starts
              with an initial  static load balance and then evolves into an adaptive
              algorithm.
