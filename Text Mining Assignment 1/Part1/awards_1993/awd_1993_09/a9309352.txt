              W X P#   9309352 Cafiso  The transport of ions across membranes is a
              fundamental process for a wide range of cellular functions including membrane
              signaling in the nervous system.  As a result, an understanding of nervous
              system function at the molecular level will require knowledge of the molecular
              structures and the structural changes in membrane proteins that promote and
              regulate ion movement.  At the present time, these structures remain largely
              uncha racterized because efficient methodologies to determine membrane protein
              structure are not available.  The research that is proposed here will
              investigate and develop new methodologies to examine membrane protein
              structure.  These methods will combine covalent labeling and powerful new
              approaches using mass spectrometry, and will be used to provide information on
              the structure and operation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.  The
              nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a membrane ion channel that functions at
              the neuromuscular junction, and it is typical in size and complexity to many
              other ion channels that function in the nervous system.  Novel molecular probe
              techniques and magnetic resonance methods will also be used to examine the
              properties and structure of important regions on the acetylcholine receptor.
