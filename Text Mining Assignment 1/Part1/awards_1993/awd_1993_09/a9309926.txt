Abstract    :
              9309926 Mantell          The award is for the evaluation of current NDE
              techniques for monitoring bonding in realtime during the in situ consolidation
              of fiber reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites.  The most promising one of
              these methods will be selected for more detailed experimental evaluation.  Bond
              quality in composite specimens will be measured by the selected NDE method and
              by mechanical testing, and the effectiveness and limitations of the selected
              technique will be evaluated.          It is expected that this research will
              lead to effective closed loop process control and will ultimately result in
              reduced manufacturing times, improve final part quality, and lower part costs
              for thermoplastic composite parts.  The technique developed here is expected to
              become a key tool in the evaluation of thermoset composites as well.
