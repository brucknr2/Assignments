Abstract    :
                   The proposed research entails questions in commutative and                
              homological algebra. The investigator proposes to examine the                  
              Buchsbaum-Eisenbud conjecture for finite length modules over                   
              classes of complete hypersurface rings. Also, resolutions over                 
              such rings will be considered in order to estimate the lower                   
              bounds of betti numbers of modules over the regular ring.
