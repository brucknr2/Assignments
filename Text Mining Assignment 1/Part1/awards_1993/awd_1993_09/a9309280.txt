Abstract    :
              9309280  Garverick  The general objective of the proposed research project is to
              develop closed-loop control electronics for electrostatic micromotors which
              improves motor performance and enables the development of
              microelectromechanical systems with increased sophistication.  Two modes of
              operation will be supported by the electronics: 1) continuous rotation, needed
              for devices such as pumps, and 2) discrete stepping, such as required in
              switching applications.  The control electronics will be designed to obtain
              approximately smooth, continuous rotation with maximum average torque,
              independent of motor loading (gaseous or liquid medium).  Both salient-pole and
              wobble micromotors will be investigated.  ***
