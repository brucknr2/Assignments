Abstract    :
              9309565  Rood                                 ABSTRACT    The Siouan Languages
              Archive is a computer data base of information in  and on the approximately 16
              languages of the Siouan family, presently or  formerly spoken in the North
              American plains and southeast. The Archive  was established in 1977-81 using
              keypunches for data entry and encoded  in a character set that provided only
              upper case roman numerals and some  mathematical symbols. All the special
              characters in the original  documents are coded with 2 and 3 character
              sequences. We will modernize  the data base by (1) converting the complex
              character coding to a more  standard scheme such as Unicode; (2) re-coding the
              numeric field labels  as mnemonic abbreviations; (3) fully standardizing field
              structure and  characters from document to document; (4) organizing document
              storage  logically; and (5) to the extent that copyright permits, making the 
              whole data base available on line, together with some kind of  concordance(s)
              or concordance programs. If time permits, we will also  fill in gaps in some of
              the documents. Work will be done by John E.  Koontz, Research Associate at the
              Center for the Study of the Native  Languages of the Plains and Southwest, and
              supervised by Prof. David S.  Rood, who originally developed the Archive.  ***
