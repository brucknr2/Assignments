Abstract    :
              9309651  Nee    This project will test theories of market transitions from state
               socialism with data from a national social survey conducted in  rural China in
              1989.  As markets replace socialist redistribution,  changes in the structure
              of opportunity and incentives give rise to  conditions more favorable to direct
              producers relative to  redistributive organizations, thus producing fundamental
              changes in  the dynamics of stratification.  This study will extend market 
              transition theory to empirical challenges posed by the growth of  rural
              industry, regional variation in the shift to markets, and  increasing income
              inequality.  A new institutionalist perspective  will also contribute to the
              empirical analysis, as hypotheses are  tested on the embeddedness of markets,
              expanding the current social  network perspective of economic sociology to
              include the  institutional framework of the economy.  %%%  The results will
              contibute significantly to the scientific  literature on social change, as well
              as to economic sociology.  The  knowledge gained will also be available to
              policy-makers and others  who need to understand the changes currently in
              progress in China.    ***
