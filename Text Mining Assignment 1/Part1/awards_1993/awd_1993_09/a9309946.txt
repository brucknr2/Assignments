Abstract    :
              9309946  Sniderman    This investigation has two fundamental objectives.  The
              first is to  explore how individuals take advantage of information they may
              pick  up in the course of an ordinary day to modify or change their  opinions. 
              By focusing on different forms of information, for  example, the source of a
              policy proposal or the specific terms in  which the proposal is put, the
              investigators aim to develop an  account of the dynamics as well as the statics
              of political  beliefs.    The second objective is to demonstrate the economies
              of multiple  investigators using a common research vehicle.  By having 
              investigators share the same survey, and by taking advantage of  experimental
              design and computer-assisted interviewing, twelve  studies, conducted by
              seventeen investigators at thirteen different  universities, can be carried for
              approximately the cost of one  conventional, national survey.    This project
              should substantially enhance our understanding of  information acquisition and
              research investigation techniques that  promote reliability, validity and
              economies of scale.  ***
