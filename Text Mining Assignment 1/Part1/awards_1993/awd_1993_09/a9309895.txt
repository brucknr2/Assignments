Abstract    :
              9309895  DeLancey      The grant will support a two-week workshop, to be held in
              the summer of 1994, of specialists in the various languages belonging to the
              hypothetical Penutian phylum.  The goal is to assemble and critically examine
              all available evidence for the Penutian hypothesis, and to determine once and
              for all the viability of the hypothesis.  The two P.I.'s will spend the
              preceding year assembling all published and other available comparative data
              for precirculation to the participants; the business of the workshop will be to
              examine those comparisons which survive critical examination by specialists in
              the individual languages, and to decide whether these data can form the basis
              of a serious theory of genetic relationship.
