Abstract    :
              9309006  Espinosa  The purpose of this Research Initiation Award is to develop a
               constitutive model for brittle amorphous materials, such as  ceramics and
              glass, for dynamic loading.  In particular, pressure-  shear experiments on
              glass thin films, in which high shear  stresses, high strain rates and high
              pressure are imposed, offer  ideal conditions for the derivation and validation
              of a  constitutive model describing these amorphous materials.  Such a  model
              will be incorporated in micromechanical simulations of  alumina polycrystals
              under the conditions of plate impact  experiments.  The postulated model is
              expected to predict such  phenomena as damage-induced anisotrophy and shear
              localization.  Model validation will be accomplished by comparison of simulated
               and interferometrically measured velocity histories in normal  impact and
              pressure-shear experiments conducted on alumina samples.
