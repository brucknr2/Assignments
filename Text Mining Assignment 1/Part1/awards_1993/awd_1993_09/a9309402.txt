Abstract    :
              9309402  Kannellakopoulos  The proposed research will focus on the development
              of the  nonlinear design toolkit.  Novel Backstepping techniques and new 
              nonlinear damping terms will be employed to design adaptive  systems with even
              stronger stability and performance properties,  by interlacing the design of
              the controller, observer and  parameter estimator.  The recent breakthrough of
              damped  interlacing will produce a new generation of adaptive systems, in 
              which adaptation is not needed for boundedness, but is used only  to improve
              transient and asymptotic performance.  To enhance the  applicability of the new
              adaptive schemes to practical problems,  their robustness with respect to
              several sources of modeling  errors will be evaluated, and new robustification
              tools will be  developed.  Finally, to understand the issues related to digital
               implementation, the problem of adaptive control of discrete-time  nonlinear
              systems will be addressed.  A discrete-time design  toolkit will be developed
              which will hopefully alleviate the need  for short sampling intervals.  ***
