Abstract    :
              9309430 Sheng          This research is for the development of a laser based
              machine tool for the finishing of axisymmetric and prismatic parts, especially
              parts made from high strength metal alloys, ceramics, and composites.  Specific
              techniques such as tangential laser beam impingement, raster scanning of the
              laser beam, use of high wavelength radiation, use of off axis water jet,
              workpiece preheating, and control of laser beam temporal and spatial modes are
              researched to improve surface finish and reduce surface thermal damage.  A
              prototype machine tool will be constructed, several classes of engineering
              materials evaluated for their machinability, and theoretical analysis of
              beam/material interaction performed.          The resulting machine tool is
              expected to be flexible in terms of the workpiece geometries that   could be
              finished, and would combine material removal and heat treatment.  The
              applications would be especially well suited to some new lasers emerging
              commercially, such as excimer, high radiance tunable dye, and copper vapor
              lasers. ***
