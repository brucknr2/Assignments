Abstract    :
              9309689  Ferrie  The purpose of this research is create a new data set of 
              Americans linked across the 1850, 1860, and 1870 federal  censuses.  Though the
              interest of scholars in longitudinal data  sets such as the Panel Study on
              Income Dynamics and the National  Longitudinal Surveys has grown enormously
              over the past twenty  five years, there are few comparable historical data sets
              that  allow us to follow the experiences of individuals over several  decades. 
              The recent creation of indexes to the 1850 and 1870  federal censuses makes it
              possible to create such historical data  sets.  In this project, a sample of
              native-born Americans linked  from a recently created Public Sample for the
              1850 census to the  1860 census will be created and their economic mobility
              compared  to mobility of immigrants analyzed in a previous study.  In 
              addition, the sample of immigrants and the new sample of native  born will also
              be linked to the 1870 census.  The creation of  this new data set will be
              invaluable to scholars interested in  understanding the dynamics of economic
              mobility and how various  groups progressed economically in the U.S. from 1850
              to 1870, a  period characterized by the rapid growth of industrialization and 
              urbanization.  ***
