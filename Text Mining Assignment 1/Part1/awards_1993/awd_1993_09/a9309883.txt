Abstract    :
              9309883  Rabitz  We propose a highly parallelizable molecular dynamics (MD) 
              approach for the study of the long time dynamics of condensed  phase systems. 
              We intend to apply our method to protein  dynamics, where the long time
              behavior is of great interest, and  the proposed methods can be used to their
              full advantage.  The  method constrains high frequency motions of the fully
              coupled  system, thus greatly reducing the dimensionality of the problem  while
              simultaneously permitting the use of a very large  integration time step.  The
              approach is to use a periodically  updated subspace of the low frequency real
              and imaginary normal  modes of the system as a reduced basis for numerical
              integration  of the dynamics.
