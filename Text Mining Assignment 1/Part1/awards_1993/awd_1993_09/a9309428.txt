Abstract    :
              9309428  Fischhoff  Global environmental problems pose difficult and far
              reaching  decisions for societies.  As with other visible and important 
              societal problems, attempts to elicit and incorporate views of  the public in
              the decision making process are often frustrated by  available survey
              techniques.  If the public is to be involved  meaningfully in these decisions,
              then several conditions need to  be met: (a) the views of representative
              members of the public  need to be elicited; (b) participants in the elicitation
              process  need to understand the impacts of different policies on their 
              households, societies, and the world; (c) participants need to  articulate the
              implications of their basic values for particular  policies; (d) participants
              must express their opinions in a way  that captures their complexity,
              intensity, and uncertainty; and  (e) opinions must be aggregated in a way that
              derives their  implications for societal decision making.  This research 
              advances an approach to meeting these conditions.  Implementing  the approach
              requires focused investigations of the different  steps in the elicitation
              process including: formulating a  coherent policy issue; explicating the
              implications of different  options; designing and standardizing the response
              mode; and  evaluating the procedure.  The research will provide fundamental 
              methods and tests to develop a new tool in preference and  valuation
              elicitation.  Later phases of the research will  demonstrate the tool and test
              it more formally with larger  numbers of participants.  ***
