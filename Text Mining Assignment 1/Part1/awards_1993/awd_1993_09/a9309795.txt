Abstract    :
                   A key component of expert and advice-giving systems is their              
              ability to provide explanations to their users.  Unfortunately,                
              current systems assume that a single explanation is sufficient and             
              that the user's only feedback will be requests for further                     
              elaboration.  In reality, however, users frequently find fault with            
              the provided explanations and respond with explanations of their               
              own for why the system's response is unacceptable.  The inability              
              to understand or respond intelligently to this user feedback                   
              significantly degrades the value of existing systems.  This project            
              initiates a research program to explore how to extend expert and               
              advice-giving systems to understand user response to their                     
              explanations and to revise these explanations accordingly.  The                
              object is an initial theory of how user feedback is understood and             
              explanation revised in response to it, along with a prototype                  
              program embodying this theory.  The proposed work will build on                
              earlier research on using abstract planning knowledge to handle one            
              specific class of user feedback.//
