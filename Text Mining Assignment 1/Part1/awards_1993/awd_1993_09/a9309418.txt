Abstract    :
                  9409834  Dorsey    This is the first year of a three-year continuing RIA
              Award to  investigate acoustic simulation techniques to improve accuracy of 
              acoustic space evaluation, utilizing theoretical and interactive  techniques to
              indicate specific acoustical effects in a three  dimensional computer model. 
              By creating and altering these  effects, the surfaces, sound emitters, and
              geometry will be  indirectly modified.  The purpose is to have the system cary
              the  burden of searching the design space, allowing the user to focus on  the
              goals of the acoustical design rather than on the details of  the model
              specification.  The project benefits from analogous work  done in lighting
              simulation and interactive graphics techniques.
