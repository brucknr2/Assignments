Abstract    :
              9309457  Head  This project expand research into the development of excess noise
              as a reliability testing technique for the Electromigration Resistance of VLSI
              intercourse.    The "noise" referred to in this context is the frequency
              dependent voltage fluctuations which occur when a DC current is passed through
              a resistive device.  The physical characteristics which influence the noise in
              the metal film "resistor" or interconnect are typically those which also
              influence the interconnect's susceptibility to damage from Electromigration. By
              relating the level of noise in metal film interconnects and to the lifetime of
              the films and perfecting the noise measurement testing techniques, the use of
              noise measurements as an enhanced reliability tool can be transferred to the
              industrial environment.  ***
