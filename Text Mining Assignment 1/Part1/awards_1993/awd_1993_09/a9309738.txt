Abstract    :
              This research will investigate the relationship between two                    
              different data structures for representing surfaces,                           
              parametric and algebraic, which have been used to solve the                    
              same set of geometric problems.  The targeted geometric                        
              problems include the problem of scattered data interpolation                   
              and the problem of the construction of blending surfaces.                      
              Practical and constructive algorithms will be developed for                    
              converting a mesh of tangent-continuous parametric surface                     
              patches to an analogous mesh of tangent-continuous algebraic                   
              surface patches and vice-versa.  Relationships between useful                  
              parameters influencing the shape of surfaces in the parametric                 
              representation to those in the algebraic representation will                   
              be explored through theoretical and experimental means.  The                   
              methods to be employed include a combination of exact symbolic                 
              computation and numerical approximation.  The results will be                  
              applied to construct new solutions and improve existing                        
              solutions to the problem of construction of blending surfaces                  
              and the visualization of fluid flow.
