Abstract    :
              Chatterjee         This research concerns the development of algorithms and 
              software tools for synthesizing signal processing and control  circuits that
              can perform highly reliable computations under  adverse conditions.  This is
              achieved by the use of both off-line  (passive) and on-line (active) method. 
              The approach is to  extract mathematical models of circuit behavior from
              high-level  descriptions of circuits, and then operate on them with numerical 
              algorithms.  These in turn generate a group of architectural  specifications
              that are functionally equivalent.  Design  optimization is achieved by
              transformation of the multiplier  constants and restructuring of the circuit
              flow graphs.  The  optimizations are carried out so as to maintain high levels
              of  testability and fault-tolerance without regard to cost criteria  such as
              node activity.
