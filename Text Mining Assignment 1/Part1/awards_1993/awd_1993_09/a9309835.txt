Abstract    :
              9309835  Gubbins  The behavior of fluids in microporous and membrane systems
              will  be investigated using novel methods, that allow the permeability  of the
              pore wall to be controlled while maintaining its atomic  nature.  A realistic
              model of the micropore will be developed  based on these methods.  The fluid
              behavior will be studied with  respect to its structural, thermodynamic and
              transport  properties.  Special attention will be given to the study of 
              anisotropy in viscosity and thermal conductivity in confined  systems. 
              Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods will  be developed for
              investigating these transport properties.
