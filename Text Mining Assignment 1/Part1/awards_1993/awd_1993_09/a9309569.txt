Abstract    :
              9309569  Lumpkin  The commercialization of therapeutic  proteins and peptides
              has been  impeded by molecular stability  problems.  Oxygen, metals, and 
              reducing agents in bioprocessing  media combine to cause irreversible  damage
              to biomolecules via metal-ion  catalyzed oxidation (MCO).   Metal-affinity
              based separations are  important new techniques in  bioprocessing where MCO
              reactions  are important. The rate constants  and parametric sensitivities of
              MCO  reactions have not been studied  under industrially relevant  conditions,
              and reactive peptide  sequences have not been identified.   The objective of
              this work is to  develop a quantitative understanding  of MCO damage through
              the  development of a kinetic model of  peptide oxidation.  ***
