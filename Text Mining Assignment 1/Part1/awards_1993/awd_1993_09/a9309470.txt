Abstract    :
               This research concerns theoretical aspects of parallel  algorithms  and
              architectures that relate directly to the performance of  ``real''  parallel
              computers.  The parallel architectures of  interest in this study are 
              multipurpose arrays of identical  processing elements.  To fully exploit a 
              parallel system,  algorithms must be translated into efficient code that can 
              be  mapped to a target architecture.  The research builds  upon earlier  work
              by formulating enhanced versions of mapping  problems for these parallel 
              architectures.  The particular focus  in this proposal is the study of such 
              mapping problems with an  eye toward improving the realism of the models, in 
              order to more  accurately predict and optimize computational performance.   
              The  mapping problems investigated are based on the modeling of  computational 
              structures with graphs.  The graph-theoretic  approach provides fundamental 
              structural information that drives  the research program.  The framework of 
              graph-embeddings is used  to study the problem of programming network 
              emulations.  The  merit of particular emulation-solutions are quantified in 
              terms  of measures of efficiency, including slowdown factors, processor  and 
              memory utilization, load balancing, and implementation  overhead.
