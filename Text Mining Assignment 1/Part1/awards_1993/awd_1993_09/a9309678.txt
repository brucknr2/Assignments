Abstract    :
              9309678  Schwartz  The objective of this proposal are to advance the electronic
              and optoelectronic properties of Si1-xGex devices grown by low temperature
              vapor deposition (LTCVD) and to extend the use of LTCVD to grow SiC on silicon.
                 The epitaxial reactor will be constructed to grow high-purity silicon-based
              heterojunctions with layer resolutions of 10nm or less.  The electronic and
              optoelectronic characteristic of the Si1-xGex material will be characterized
              with an emphasis on the optoelectronic properties.  By exploiting the bandgap
              tunability of the Si1-xGex, infrared photodetectors will be fabricated and
              tested.  The introduction of SiC to silicon-based electronics will extend the
              use of silicon-based heterjunction devices into more demanding environments. 
              The focus of the SiC research will be in the area of electronic devices.  The
              merging of Si1-xGex, SiC and silicon technologies is made possible through low
              temperature chemical vapor deposition.  ***
