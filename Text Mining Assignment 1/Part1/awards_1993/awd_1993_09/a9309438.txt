              from porous Si has been a research focus since 1991, when the visible 
              photoluminescence from the electrochemically etched Si was first reported. This
              discovery was an  important scientific breakthrough, because of its potential
              technological implications. It also raises the  fundamental question of light
              emitting mechanism. Despite the still obscure understanding of porous Si,    
              another Si related compound, siloxene, was found to be porous Si like with
              visible light emission  characteristics.    This proposed project is based on
              the current research activity on porous Si, siloxene and  siloxene thin films
              in our laboratory.    We propose to develop new thin film deposition schemes
              for  siloxene thin films and the related light emitting device (LED)
              structures.    The advantage of developing  such thin films is to    avoid the
              limitation from the current electrochemical anodization method with porous    
              Si. Ultimately, the LED structure based on the siloxene thin film could be
              implemented to the large scale  flat panel display. ***
