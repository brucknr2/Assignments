Abstract    :
              This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is                 
              made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Lynn C. Francesconi of                   
              the Chemistry Department, Hunter College-City University of New                
              York.  The bonding, structure, and reactivity of                               
              technitium-oxygen compounds would be investigated.  During the                 
              planning period, two strategies for incorporating Tc, and its                  
              congener Re, into polyoxoanions of molybdenum and tungsten                     
              would be attempted.  Successful completion of this preliminary                 
              research would allow work to proceed on synthesis of a wide                    
              variety of compounds containing technitium-oxygen bonds.  A                    
              long-term goal of research in this area is to enable the                       
              separation or immobilization of technetium, which has a                        
              long-lived isotope common in nuclear waste site contaminants,                  
              in borosilicate or phosphate glasses.
