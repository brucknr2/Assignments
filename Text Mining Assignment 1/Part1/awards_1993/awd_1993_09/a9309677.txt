Abstract    :
              9309677  Smith  This grant will support research to improve 2-D ultrasonic 
              transducers by using opto-electronic transmitter technology to  replace power
              amplifiers and coaxial cables.  Low power diode  lasers, optical fibers and
              photo conductive switches will be used  in the new system.  This research will
              be aimed at determining if  the photo-conductive switches can be optimized for
              this  application.    This research is important since it has the potential to 
              eliminate the bulky transducer cables now used with high density  ultrasonic
              arrays and thus allow the systems to be more flexible  and to consist of more
              transmit channels.  ***
