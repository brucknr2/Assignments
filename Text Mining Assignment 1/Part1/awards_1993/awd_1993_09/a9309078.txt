Abstract    :
              9309078  Edwards  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which
              is to find a relatively  short-term procedure that can be utilized to  predict
              the long-term corrosion behavior of  materials that are used in contact with 
              water.  The research involves coupling the  use of corrosion-accelerating
              electrical  currents with electrochemical determination  of the corrosion rate.
               The proposal leading  to this award was submitted in response to  NSF 92-122,
              Research Initiation Awards  Program Announcement and Guidelines.    Materials
              used in constructing water  distribution systems are subject to corrosion  over
              long periods of time.  Corrosion reduces  the effective life of the system's
              components  and has a potentially degrading effect on the  quality of the
              water.  A short-term procedure  that will adequately determine the effect of 
              corrosion can be useful in the engineering  design of water distribution
              systems.
