Abstract    :
                                                   Baker 9309948     Pheromones are chemical
              compounds secreted for the purpose of  chemical communication, with a
              well-known example being the  airborne odorants secreted by female moths to
              attract males from  great distances.  Insects detect pheromones by specialized
              receptor  cells in the antenna that are considered to be among the most 
              specific chemosensory receptors known.  But in some moth species,  the female
              emits extra compounds considered redundant components  along the with active
              pheromone itself, and males have some  receptors sensitive to pheromones that
              also are sensitive to  compounds not emitted by their own females.  This
              project combines  neurophysiology, anatomy and behavior to pinpoint the
              neuronal  basis for the behaviorally expressed olfactory redundancy, and to 
              explore how specific attractant odors from plants also may modify  the response
              to attractant pheromones at both the cellular and the  behavioral level.  This
              system provides a unique opportunity to  clarify how odor blends of different
              compounds can apparently smell  similar to an animal, and how the chemical
              context of an odor  affects the response to that odor.  Further, the presence
              of mutant  strains with changed pheromone blends allows considering how the 
              reduncancy allows an evolutionarily important flexibility to the  communication
              system.  This work will clarify how the olfactory  connections within the brain
              are organized to handle mixtures, and  so will have an impact on chemosensory
              studies in general.  The  work also will clarify aspects of the evolution of
              chemical  communication, and because this species is a significant crop pest, 
              will have impact on agricultural use of insect control.   ***
