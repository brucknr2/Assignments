Abstract    :
              9309610  Heal    This research will further develop the issue raised in the 
              investigator's paper "International Negotiations on Emission  Control."  That
              paper studies the incentives that countries have to  join and to remain in
              international agreements on the abatement of  global pollution.  It develops
              the concept of a critical abatement  coalition, one with the property that all
              members are net gainers  from membership.  There will be a smallest critical
              coalition  because of certain threshold effects.    One of the earlier paper's
              results is to identify as very important  in the stability of coalitions the
              extent of cross effects on net  benefits between countries that join a
              coalition.  These will be  referred to as "reinforcement mechanisms."  In
              particular, the  stability of agreements is increased by the extent to which 
              abatement by country i increases the marginal net benefit of  country j from
              abatement by j.  This research will identify and  model ways in which the
              introduction of abatement policies by one  country could reduce the abatement
              costs of another and provide  reinforcement mechanisms.    The research will
              then take two initial steps towards empirically  implementing the ideas of
              critical coalitions and reinforcement  mechanisms.  One will be a preliminary
              attempt to identify  alternative minimum critical coalitions for the avoidance
              of global  climate change.  The second will be a preliminary identification of 
              reinforcement mechanisms.    ***
