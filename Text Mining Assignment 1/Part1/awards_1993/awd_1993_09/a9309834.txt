Abstract    :
              9309834 Laguna          Gravitational Physics is one of the areas in which
              supercomputer technology has imprinted its most dramatic effects.  One and two
              dimensional numerical simulations of strongly gravitating systems and
              inhomogeneous spacetimes can be performed with an extremely high degree of
              resolution, and modeling of three dimensional systems is finally within reach. 
              Three dimensional studies of general relativistic systems require, even with
              existing supercomputers, codes capable of efficiently utilizing computer memory
              and speed.  The challenge is then an intensive pursuit of computational
              optimality as a function of physical information obtained.  Two principal areas
              will be investigated:          1.      ` `    Numerical Relativity and Black
              Hole Collisions:  Work will be conducted to obtain initial data using York's
              original conformal method.  The three dimensional cosmological code developed
              by Kurki Suonio, Laguna and Matzner is being adapted to compute black hole
              evolution.  This code will serve as an arena to investigate implementations of
              boundary conditions, gauge conditions and evolution schemes.  Numerical
              evolution of an inhomogeneous, planar, vacuum cosmology using Ashtekar's new
              variables will be studied.  !`            2.      ` `    Inhomogeneous
              Cosmologies and Inflation:  The Kurki Suonio/Laguna/Matzner cosmological code
              will be used to investigate the onset of inflation under inhomogeneous matter
              sources.  The COBE satellite has provided observations of cosmic background
              radiation anisotropies.  Collisionless matter and eventually hydrodynamical
              sources will be implemented into the Kurki Suonio/Laguna/Matzner code to inves
              tigate anisotropic effects in the cosmic background radiation from the
              propagation of microwave photons through evolving density inhomogeneities (Rees
              Sciama effect).  !`   ***
