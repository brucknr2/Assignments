Abstract    :
              9309690  Barton  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of  Missouri--St.
              Louis in the purchase of an x-ray diffractometer  and an associated data
              analysis system.  This new  instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a
              number of  areas including the following:  Structural and mechanistic  studies
              of Dppc-bridged diplatinum complexes; Structural  studies of group IV
              derivatives of pentaborane(9) and  hexaborane(10); The use of high resolution
              diffraction x-ray  analyses of the electronic and structural properties of 
              organometallic molecules; Chiral phosphonamides in  stereoselective bond
              formations; and Structural studies of  silicon tricycles and silicon-silicon
              bonds.  %%%  The x-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise 
              measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a  molecule.  The
              information obtained gives the precise values of  all the bond distances and
              bond angles of a given molecule and  it gives accurate information about the
              spatial arrangement of  that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
