              ABSTRACT       Fabrication techniques in microelectronics has outpaced 
              developments in soldering.  The process of soldering is to be  examined with
              emphasis on greater understanding of the underlying  transport phenomena. 
              Integrated experimental and theoretical  approaches will focus on joint shape
              prediction, solder defect  analysis and reactive wetting to improve soldering
              technology.      Soldering is important throughout the electronics industry.  
              Advances in soldering could reduce failure rates to increase  productivity or
              maintain performance while better addressing  environmental considerations.
