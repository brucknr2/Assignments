Abstract    :
              9309053  Ducheyne  This grant will support a study of the mechanisms involved in
              the  promotion of bone tissue formation and bonding by bioactive  materials. 
              Specifically, the research will determine if  carbonate containing
              hydroxyapatite with small crystal dimensions  is the rate limiting reaction. 
              The study will make use of  transmission electron microscopy and atomic force
              microscopy.    This study is important since it may lead to the development of 
              new materials for implant devices or to the optimization of  presently used
              materials for orthopedic and dental implants.  ***
