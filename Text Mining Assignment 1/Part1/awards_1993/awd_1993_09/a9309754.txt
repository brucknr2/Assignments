Abstract    :
              As laminated fiber composite structural elements become more                   
              popular, their mechanical properties need to be efficiently                    
              modeled; in particular, that there be a complete understanding of              
              their buckling and postbuckling behavior.  The work will plan for              
              a study focused on the development of methods for analyzing the                
              local, Euler, and flexural-torsional modes of buckling in laminated            
              composite beams of open and closed cross section.  The effects of              
              shear deformation will be accounted for. The methods will be                   
              developed for beams whose cross-sectional elements consist of                  
              rectangular laminated plates with varying degrees of anisotropy.//
