Abstract    :
              9309176  Griffioen  This research project to address the issues involved in the 
              design of scalable high-performance distributed file systems  based on volatile
              storage.  The flexibility of such system  combined with recent technology
              trends provides an opportunity  for exceptional performance and superior
              resource utilization.    The research has four components.  First, a new
              distributed  file system abstraction that incorporates both volatile and 
              stable storage into a single abstraction will be investigated.   The
              abstraction allows users to adjust the persistence  guarantees of a file to
              match the requirements of the  application, thereby optimizing performance. 
              Second, a novel  memory architecture called loosely-coupled memory that 
              provides a massive aggregate memory space for use by the  proposed file system
              will be introduced.  The architecture  also incorporates asymmetric compression
              techniques to make  effective use of memory and underutilized processing power,
               and to improve file system access time.  Third, a new  abstraction and file
              system architecture into the BM Xinu  operating system to verify our design. 
              VM Xinu provides a  high-performance, low-latency communication protocol ideal
              for  support of a loosely-coupled memory system.  Finally, the file  system
              will be incorporated into the Mach operating system to  demonstrate and
              evaluate our ideas in the context of a large  user population.  ***
