Abstract    :
                   Use of causal networks for problem-solving has been an active             
              research area in AI, but current methods are limited because of                
              their complexity and the difficulty of obtaining the needed causal             
              knowledge.  It is proposed here that these problems could be                   
              overcome by applying neural network methods directly to causal                 
              networks.  To test this hypothesis, this project will 1) derive                
              methods for formulating probabilistic inferences as highly                     
              parallel, strictly local computations, and 2) derive methods for               
              learning causal relationships and their associated probabilities               
              from case data.  Unlike past neural modeling work, these methods               
              will directly act on causal networks without requiring their own               
              separate networks.  Properties of these methods, such as systems               
              convergence, will be analyzed using theories of stochastic                     
              processes and dynamic systems.  Measurement of approximation errors            
              will be developed.  Computer simulations using different causal                
              networks will be performed to verify the theoretical results and to            
              select important parameters such as annealing and learning rates.              
              The main contribution of this work is expected to be the                       
              development of new, potentially more efficient inference and                   
              learning methods that enjoy the advantages of both causal networks             
              and neural networks.  They can be used in expert systems for                   
              diagnosis, theory formation, decision support, and other                       
              applications involving probabilistic reasoning.  It will also                  
              provide a concrete example of high level inference using neural                
              network methods that make direct use of an AI representation.//
