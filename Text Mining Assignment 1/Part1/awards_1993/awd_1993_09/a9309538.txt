Abstract    :
              9309538  Bateman  The purpose of this collaborative project is to collect the 
              remaining farm and household data from the federal censuses of  agriculture and
              population for a sample of 140 rural townships  across the northern half of the
              United States, and to assemble  from them a panel database covering a vital
              sector of the  American economy at a crucial juncture in time.  The data will 
              form a critical link between a cross-sectional sample from these  same
              communities that was drawn over twenty years ago and a  similar cross-sectional
              sample that is now being completed.   These cross-sections cover a thirty-year
              period for tens of  thousands of farms and hundreds of thousands of
              individuals.   They provide one of the most detailed and comprehensive views of
               economic and social interactions in rural America and the  outcomes of the
              decisions made by individual farmers.  Among the  questions that will be
              addressed using these panel data are  agricultural's adaptation to change in
              competition, the scale and  scope of markets resulting from reductions in
              transportation  costs, and changes in international trade policies; the
              changing  structure of farms and farm ownership; and the consequences of  rural
              to urban migration upon rural areas.  This research is  important because it
              will offer new insights into the development  of the American economy at a
              critical period of its history, and  it will produce a valuable database  for
              economists,  demographers, rural sociologist, and other scholars interested in 
              economic growth and development and rural to urban migration.  ***
