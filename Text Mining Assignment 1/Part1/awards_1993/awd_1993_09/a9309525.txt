Abstract    :
                  9309525  Heckman  This grant supplements the budget of a grant (SES-9111455)
              to  explore both analytical and empirical issues that arise in  evaluating the
              impact of government training programs on  trainees.  The original study is
              based on unique data from an  ongoing evaluation of the Job Training
              Partnership Act (JTPA).   Supplemental funding would permit acquisition of data
              from  several new sources and completion of new tasks that would  greatly
              enhance the research outlined in the original proposal.      More specifically,
              funds are requested to collect data on state-  determined performance standards
              that affect training center  incentives to enroll certain categories of
              trainees.  These  financial incentive schedules are in the public domain but
              are  not available in any central location.  Knowledge of these  incentives
              permits construction of a model of bureaucratic  decision making and response
              to incentives that is of interest in  its own right.    Funds are requested to
              collate and utilize a rich new body of  data on subcontracting by training
              centers.  These centers use  subcontracts with their vendors to shift the risk
              of  noncompliance with state performance standards.  Access has been  gained to
              a valuable source of data on contracts let by training  centers and bids
              submitted by vendors.  The analysis of these  data will greatly aid in the
              development of a behavioral model of  training center behavior.  It will, also
              provide valuable new  evidence on central propositions in the economics of
              contracting.  ***
