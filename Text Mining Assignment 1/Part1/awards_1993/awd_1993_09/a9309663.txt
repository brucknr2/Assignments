Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to develop a technique that             
              allows a designer to play an active role in the design optimization            
              process.  This research combines fast optimization methods, based              
              on sensitivity analysis, with virtual reality techniques to provide            
              an interactive method for design optimization.  Fast optimization              
              methods are needed to allow large design problems to be                        
              investigated in an interactive time frame.  Virtual reality                    
              techniques provide an interactive environment for the designer to              
              investigate multiple design changes.  Keeping the designer active              
              in the design process allows the designer to use all of his/her                
              prior knowledge about the problem to be brought to bear to achieve             
              a viable, optimal solution to the problem in a timely manner.                  
                   Design is an interactive process that often involves trade-               
              offs between competing performance criteria.  For example,                     
              designers strive to design vehicles that are both lightweight and              
              strong.  Design of large structural systems is accomplished through            
              the aid of sophisticated optimization software.  Currently, the                
              interaction a designer has with the optimization process is limited            
              to the initial stages of problem definition, where the designer                
              specifies an objective function, design parameters, and                        
              constraints.  As the design process progresses, design objectives              
              and constraints are often modified based on the designer's                     
              experience, in order to achieve a viable solution.
