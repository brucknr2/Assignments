Abstract    :
                  9309520  Soboyejo  The initiation and evolution of damage in 
              unidirectional/multidirectional titanium matrix composites will be 
              investigated using a combined experimental and analytical approach.   Damage
              will be monitored using noise filtered acoustic emission  signals, high
              resolution in-situ optical microscopy, and in-situ  scanning electron
              microscopy.  Incremental damage accumulation  experiments will also be
              performed in which local and global  measures of constituent (matrix, fiber and
              interface) or composite  modulus will be used as indicators of damage due to
              microcracking  or plasticity.  Micromechanics and macromechanics models are 
              developed and applied to the prediction of damage initiation under  monotonic
              or cyclic loading.  ***
