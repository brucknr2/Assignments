Abstract    :
              9309833  Sethna  I propose to investigate the dynamics and pattern formation of 
              yield and failure in two specific sets of models, one describing  fracture and
              slip in elastic media, and another addressing phase  slip in sliding charge
              density wave conductors.  In the former, I  propose to study models which
              incorporate both nonlinear  dynamical processes and disorder.  Both dynamics
              and disorder are  no doubt important in determining the complex structure and 
              response of stressed materials, but most approaches to date  typically treat
              one or the other.  In the second class of models  describing charge density
              wave (CDW) conductors, I propose to  study models which allow the CDW to "tear"
              via phase slip  processes.  Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that 
              the noise spectra observed experimentally in CDW's arises from  such processes.
               Both these problems represent sizable  computational tasks, but I expect that
              they can be simulated  effectively in parallel architectures.
