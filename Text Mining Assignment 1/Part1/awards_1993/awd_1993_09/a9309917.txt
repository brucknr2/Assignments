Abstract    :
              9309917  Metaxes  This is the first year of a three year continuing grant.  This
               research addresses the problem of shape and nonrigid motion  estimation using
              physics-based techniques and a general active  vision approach. Almost all
              prior model-based shape and norigid  motion estimation techniques assume prior
              data segmentation, simple  parameterized models, fixed model size grids and a
              single viewpoint  under orthographic projection. Real world images require far
              more  sophisticated algorithms and models than the currently existing  ones in
              order to robustly recover the shape and motions of the  underlying objects.
              This research project will first explore new  physics-based techniques for the
              fitting of models to image data in  case of general orthographic, perspective,
              and stereo projections.  Such data will include projections of complex objects
              with surface  discontinuities appearing on the image as internal edges.  Then, 
               adaptive finite element techniques will be developed to improve the 
              efficiency and accuracy of shape estimation through automatic local  adjustment
              of the model's initial grid size.  These efforts will be  facilitated by the
              experience gained from the PI's previously  developed physics-based modeling
              system for shape and nonrigid  motion estimation.
