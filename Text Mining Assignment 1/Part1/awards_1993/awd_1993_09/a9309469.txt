Abstract    :
                   This project explores next-generation neural computing based              
              on oscillatory behavior of neuron columns found in the visual                  
              cortex and olfactory bulbs of mammals.  The biological basis for               
              looking further than magnitude of signals is sufficient as                     
              supported by recent discoveries such as evidence of oscillations in            
              the olfactory bulbs of rabbits which helped them to determine the              
              sex and age of other rabbits.  That state of neuron would not be               
              considered as a simple level or magnitude, but rather a combination            
              of magnitude, frequency, phase, and perhaps other attributes, of               
              its output relative to other neighboring neurons.  This research               
              seeks to analyze and characterize the behavior of coupled                      
              oscillatory systems by mathematically deriving closed-form                     
              solutions to the dynamic equations and simulation, the behavior of             
              the coupled oscillatory columns can be observed by varying the                 
              stimulus, self-feedback gain, lateral coupling, and frequency                  
              parameter of oscillation.  The effects of Gaussian noise on large              
              networks of oscillatory columns will also be investigated.
