Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop a deeper understanding               
              of technical change by examining the patterns in the location of               
              invention in the U.S. manufacturing sector between 1870 and 1929,              
              a period of integration of national product markets as well as of              
              radical changes in technology and in industrial structure.  The                
              issue of the location of invention will be explored in two                     
              different senses of the term.  First, the basic quantitative                   
              record of the geographic distribution of patenting over the                    
              period, as well as a better understanding of the basis for, and                
              prevalence of, the phenomenon of geographic clustering in                      
              inventive activity will be established.  Although there has been               
              much interest by scholars and policy makers in the importance of               
              local externalities in invention, and many anecdotal references                
              to cases such as Silicon Valley, there has to date been only                   
              limited systematic empirical investigation of the subject.                     
              Second, the study will analyze the extent to which inventive                   
              activity was located within the firms that actually used the                   
              technology.  It is conventional to think of invention as an                    
              activity that occurs within the boundaries of the firms, but at                
              various times firms have bought or licensed much of their                      
              technology from outside suppliers.  This research is important                 
              because it will shed new light on the processes of innovation and              
              the diffusion of new technology.
