Abstract    :
              9309229  Mastrangelo  The object of this research is the development of
              analytical methods and computer tools for the automatic synthesis of VLSI and
              micromechanical fabrication processes.  These tools take a geometrical
              description of a proposed device as input, decompose it into layers, and
              generate a description of the fabrication sequence and mask set using a
              systematic procedure.  This research develops: (a) topological decomposition
              and reconstruction methods for two- and three-dimensional structures and (b) a
              computer program that implements the algorithms and interfaces to simulators
              and semiconductor equipment.  The analytical methods use multilevel and
              multidimensional logic and determine fundamental questions of sequence
              uniqueness and minimality.    These tools allow designers to practice
              concept-to manufacturing without knowledge of intermediate fabrication steps
              yet using fabrication sequences much more complex that those existent today.
