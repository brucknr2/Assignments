Abstract    :
                   Technology Transfer is difficult to measure in an                         
              industry/university environment.  This difficulty appears to be due            
              to causes.  The first is that there have been almost no studies                
              within organized technology-based research ventures that have                  
              sufficient data points to make them generalizable.  The second is              
              because there is a dearth of tools for assessing transfer of                   
              technology and information in inter-disciplinary cooperation                   
              research programs.                                                             
                   This proposal will address these problems by: 1) holding an               
              Invitational Technology Transfer Assessment Consensus Conference to            
              develop the assessment instruments for a study, 2) study                       
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) using the            
              recommended instruments for possible use in the I/UCRC, Evaluation             
              Program.                                                                       
                   The Principal Investigator is a noted evaluation researcher               
              studying technology transfer and has the experience necessary for              
              this study.                                                                    
                   The Program Manager recommends Dr. Craig Scott be awarded                 
              $54,548 for one year for this project.
