Abstract    :
              9309591  Doyle       Computer-aided process operations management includes tasks
               such as process monitoring, regulatory control, data  reconciliation, unit and
              plant-wide optimization, process fault  diagnosis, supervisory control,
              planning and scheduling.  Due to  the inter-dependencies of these tasks,
              operations management  involves coordination of these tasks in an integrated
              manner.  The  proliferation of disparate tools and techniques to carry out
              these  different tasks imposes barriers to problem integration by  fragmenting
              the system implementation and the solution process.   Dealing with integration
              requires a careful choice of problem-  solving paradigms, knowledge
              representation, search and reasoning  techniques so as not burden the
              individual tasks and at the same  time providing a unified framework.       In
              this research, the researchers will develop a new course  on computer
              integrated process operations that will address the  nature of these
              operational tasks, the character of integration,  the use of artificial
              intelligence, math programming and nonlinear  modeling techniques that are
              necessary and inevitable for achieving  this automation.  This course will
              bring state-of-the-art tools and  techniques and industrial case studies to the
              class room to educate  and prepare undergraduate and graduate students in
              current trends  in computer-integrated manufacturing in the chemical process 
              industries.
