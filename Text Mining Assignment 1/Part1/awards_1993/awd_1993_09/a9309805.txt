Abstract    :
              9309805  Holekamp    Drs. Holekamp and Smale will continue their field study of
              behavioral development in free-  living spotted hyenas.  Their goals are (1) to
              initiate study of the hormonal correlates of  aggressive and sexual behaviors
              in this species as these change at puberty and during adult  breeding cycles,
              and (2) to evaluate effects of social rank on reproduction.  The animals  being
              studied are members of one large hyena clan in the Masai Mara National Reserve,
               Kenya.  Age, sex, kin relations, and social status are known for all clan
              members, and  detailed social histories are known for all cubs and subadults
              currently present in the  population.    Using observational study, radio
              telemetry, and laboratory analyses of hormone levels in  various biological
              fluids produced by the study animals, Drs. Holekamp and Smale will  collect
              longitudinal behavioral and hormonal data from both pubertal and adult animals.
                Endocrine and behavioral data will be used together to test hypotheses about
              mechanisms by  which social rank influences reproductive performance.  While
              the study of reproduction is  being initiated, observational and telemetric
              data-collection will also continue germane to  understanding both male
              dispersal and reproductive success in both sexes.    This research project will
              generate useful information in at least four ways:  It will (1)  contribute
              importantly to elucidation of carnivore reproductive biology, (2) provide
              detailed  data on behavioral development and reproductive endocrinology of
              animals experiencing the  full complexity of their natural habitat, (3) enhance
              understanding of the relationship between  hormones and aggressive behavior in
              female mammals, and (4) yield valuable comparative  data revealing how
              physiological, developmental, functional, and phylogenetic factors interact  to
              shape mammalian social behavior.
