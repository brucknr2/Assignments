Abstract    :
              9309458  DeTar       Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be
               centered on two broad areas in quantum field theory.  The first  area is in
              computer studies of quantum chromodynamics, whose  equations are believed to
              describe strong forces among elementary  particles.  The second area is in the
              mathematical foundations of  certain quantum field theories.  These are
              relevant to a wide  class of phenomena, including superconductivity at high 
              temperatures.  The research is important in providing a better  understanding
              of fundamental forces among elementary particles.  ***
