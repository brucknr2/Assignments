              9309533 Selig The specific objectives of the research are:  1) critically
              examine current pipe installation practice, 2) evaluate the implications of
              installation practices on pipe performance to assess the benefits of new
              methods, 3) determine the basis for representing the influence of adjacent
              methods 3) determine the basis for representing the influence of adjacent
              undisturbed soil conditions, 4) define bedding alternatives and their effect on
              performance, and 5) develop improved compaction specifications for more
              efficient construction.  Because these subjects have a very important influence
              on pipe performance, and because the early work is out of date as a result of
              changes in engineering and construction technologies over the years, the
              proposed new research is critically needed.    Laboratory tests will be used to
              investigate compatibility of backfill soil, to study soil behavior in the
              important haunch zone and to investigate stresses and deflections induced
              during compaction of the backfill.  Field tests will be performed to
              investigate the nature of bedding and installation methods under realistic
              conditions.  Computer analyses will be used to interpret the experimental
              conditions and extend the applicability to conditions not tested.
