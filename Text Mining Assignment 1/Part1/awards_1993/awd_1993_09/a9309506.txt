Abstract    :
              Liu         The objective of this research is to develop efficient  signal
              processing algorithms and architectures based on a new  numerical matrix
              decomposition called the URV decomposition. The  major advantage of the URV
              decomposition is that it provides as  much information as the singular value
              decomposition but with  much less computational complexity. Using this new
              numerical  tool, signal processing algorithms that currently employ either  the
              singular value or QR decompositions can be reformulated,  leading to more
              efficient and robust implementations. Analysis  and development of efficient
              URV-based signal processing  algorithms will be conducted with applications to
              adaptive array  processing, reduced rank signal processing, signal compression,
               multi-dimensional filter design, and image processing. VLSI  architectures and
              parallel processor implementations will also be  considered for
              high-performance signal processing using the URV  decomposition.
