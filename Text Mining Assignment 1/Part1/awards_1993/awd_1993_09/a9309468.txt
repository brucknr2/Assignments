Abstract    :
              9309468 Boynton          Professor Boynton will conduct two null experiments to
              test the inverse square law of gravity in the critical range between 10 cm and
              100 meters with significantly higher precision than earlier work.  He has
              devised a new class of torsion pendulum detector designed specifically to
              provide high sensitivity to deviations from Newtonian gravity.  Special care
              has gone into the experimental design to measure and remove systematic error
              sources due to gravity gradients.  The experimental site on the Hanford DOE
              reservation will be constructed by Battelle Northwest Laboratories as an
              extension of their involvement with gravitation physics through the LIGO
              project.          Departure's from Newton's description of gravity are not
              expected to be seen.  Nevertheless, these experiments will set sensitive limits
              to the strengths and ranges of possible fundamental non gravitational forces
              which might act on electrically neutral matter. ***
