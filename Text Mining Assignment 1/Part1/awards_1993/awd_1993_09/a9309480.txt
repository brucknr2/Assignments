                        9309480 Oswald  The kainate receptor is a subtype of glutamate
              receptor and is one of the most prevalent neurotransmitter receptors in the
              vertebrate central nervous system.  A novel class of kainate receptors from
              nonmammalian vertebrate brain that has structural homologies to ion channels
              activated by glutamate and kainate but which interacts with GTP binding
              proteins (G proteins) is being studied.  Dr. Oswald's working hypothesis is
              that this receptor or class of receptors has a dual function.  That is, the
              signal transduction mechanism consists of both a rapid opening of an ion
              channel and a slower response mediated by G proteins.  The cDNAs coding for
              several kainate recept ors have been cloned and several additional partial
              sequences have been obtained using the polymerase chain reaction.  The purposes
              of the studies described in this proposal are to determine which kainate
              receptors and combination of kainate receptors can form functional ion channels
              and to investigate the structural basis of ion channel activity, kainate
              binding, and possibly G protein activation.  The results of these experiments
              should provide important information on the function and diversity of this
              abundant excitatory amino acid receptor family. ***
