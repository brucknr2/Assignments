Abstract    :
              9309286  Wang, Allen    This award supports collaboration between researchers at
              the  University of Wyoming and the Chinese Academy of Sciences'  Institute of
              Systems Science, Beijing, in development and  study (both theoretical and
              experimental) of methods and  techniques which allow computation of an
              approximation to  the solution of a differential equation in an efficient way. 
               The work proposed will draw on the complementary skills of  the Chinese group,
              headed by Professor Lin Qun, in numerical  analysis, particularly on finite
              element method, and the  skills of the Wyoming group in large scale computation
              and  mathematical modeling.    Mathematical models and scientific computations
              are playing  an increasingly important role in many applied fields such  as
              weather prediction, energy conversion analysis and  design, contaminant
              transport, etc. The proposed research  has important implications for
              contributing to practical  solution of such problems through advanced numerical
               methods.  The combination of theoretical strengths of the  Chinese
              participants and the practical experience of the US  participants should
              produce results which neither group  could accomplish without the
              collaboration.
