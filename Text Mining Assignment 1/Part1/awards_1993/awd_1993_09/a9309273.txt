Abstract    :
                   In a pilot study motivated by recent results on the lateral               
              connectivity and dynamic processes in the mammalian neocortex, a               
              new model of coritcal self-organization called LCSOFM (Laterally               
              Connected Self-Organizing Feature Map) was developed.  This                    
              research focuses on LCSOFM as a computational model of the primary             
              visual cortex.  The main hypothesis is that the lateral                        
              connectivity in the visual cortex mediates cooperation and                     
              competition necessary for the self-organization and low-level                  
              perceptual phenomena.  The hypothesis will be tested by building a             
              LCSOFM model of the visual cortex and analyzing its behavior                   
              through simulated neuroscience experiments.  The LCSOFM model                  
              permits computational study of the visual cortex at a new, more                
              fundamental level than earlier models, and allows us to test                   
              several new hypotheses about its structure and function.  Based on             
              the pilot study, there is reason to believe that the model can                 
              verify whether (1) self-organization can be based on cooperation               
              and competition among laterally connected neurons; (2) the observed            
              patterns of long-range lateral connections arise from correlations             
              in neural activity; (3) plasticity of the cortex results from                  
              reorganization of lateral connections; (4) tilt illusions arise                
              from competition of neural responses in laterally connected                    
              retinotopic maps; (5) gestalt principles can be extracted from                 
              visual experience and encoded into lateral connections; and (6)                
              cooperation and competition through lateral connection, combine                
              with binding by phase-locking, can be responsible for segmentation             
              of visual input into coherent wholes.//
