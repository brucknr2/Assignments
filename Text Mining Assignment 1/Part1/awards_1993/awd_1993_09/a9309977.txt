Abstract    :
                9309977  McCormick    The diverse and very large vertebrate group of bony
              fishes have an  inner ear used for hearing.  Behavioral studies show that
              species  have different capabilities for hearing underwater sound, sometimes 
              correlated with peripheral structural specializations such as an  acoustic
              connection from the swimbladder.  Recent work in  neuroanatomy has shown that
              there also are specializations in the  cellular populations, called nuclei, in
              auditory centers in the  brains of some fish species that hear very well;
              brains of some  fish considered to have more primitive auditory systems lack
              these  specializations.  This project uses neuroanatomical techniques to  trace
              the pathways of nerve fibers from the individual inner ear  sensory organs to
              these central nuclei, and to clarify the detailed  structure of these nuclei,
              in species chosen to represent  particular generalized versus specialized
              features of anatomy or  behavior.  The results will determine how the central
              nervous  system components for hearing are organized differently between 
              specialists and generalists.  This work provides important  groundwork
              influencing future physiological, behavioral, and  theoretical work on hearing
              in fish and on underwater sound  reception.  It has educational impact in
              strongly involving  undergraduate students directly in research.  In addition,
              it will  have impact on studies of biodiversity by directly addressing the 
              variation of vertebrate hearing mechanisms, and on studies of  evolution of
              hearing in the vertebrates.  ***
