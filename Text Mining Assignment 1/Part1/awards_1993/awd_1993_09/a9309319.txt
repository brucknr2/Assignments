Abstract    :
              Manolakos         The main goal of this project is the design and evaluation  of
              VLSI architectures for the efficient estimation of Higher  Order Statistics
              (HOS) from time-series data.  In addition  parallel algorithms to speed-up
              off-line HOS-based data analysis  and modeling in parallel processing systems
              are being developed.   Simulations are being performed on a Transputer-based 
              multiprocessor for validation purposes and proof-of-concept  prototypes will be
              designed using hardware description languages  for performance/area estimation.
               As a by-product of this  research, public domain parallel processing software
              will be  provided on various platforms (CM, Transputers, Monsoon dynamic 
              data-flow) to allow scientists who are not experts in signal  processing to
              experiment with the powerful HOS-based techniques  in the analysis and modeling
              of large amounts of statistical  data.
