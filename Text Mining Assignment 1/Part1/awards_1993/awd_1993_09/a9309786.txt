Abstract    :
              9309786  Weigend  The progress in the last decade in  predicting and
              understanding time  series has been remarkable.  Where  once time series
              analysis was  shaped by linear systems theory, it  is now possible to recognize
              when  an apparently complicated time  series has been produced by a low- 
              dimensional nonlinear system,  characterize its essential  properties, and
              build a model that  can be used for prediction.  At the  opposite extreme,
              there is now a  much richer framework for designing  algorithms such as neural
              networks  that can learn and adapt to the  structure in time series that do 
              not have a simple origin.  This  research addresses the following  three
              questions:  How to estimate  the accuracy in time series  prediction, how to
              deal with data  sets that are noisy and chaotic,   and how to characterize the
              system  that temporal sequence by analyzing  the predictive model.  The tools
              to  be developed in response to these  questions combine recent advances  from
              connectionism and dynamical  systems theory.  They will be  evaluated on
              real-world data,  submitted by various groups for  consideration at the Time
              Series  Prediction and Analysis Competition  that was held under the auspices
              of  the Santa Fe Institute.  ***
