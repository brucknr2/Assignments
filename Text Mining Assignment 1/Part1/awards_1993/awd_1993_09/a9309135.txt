Abstract    :
              9309135  Shvaytser  This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. 
              This  research will investigate what information can be extracted from 
              sequences of several frames taken from a scene with temporal  variations.  Most
              computer vision techniques use still images, or  pairs of still images, to
              analyze a scene.  Yet, video cameras  capable of providing dense video motion
              sequences are just as  affordable as still image cameras.  New Algorithms will
              be  developed for computing optical flow  and dense displacement  fields, 3D
              structure and motion, and for object recognition. The  emphasis will be on
              developing algorithms that can take advantage  of more than one or two image
              frames.  The approach to flow  computation involves investigating alternatives
              to the classical  view that image flow can be computed as a minimization
              problem,  defined in terms of multiple constraints.  While 3D structure and 
              motion can be computed from accurate flow, robustness requires  rigidity
              assumptions and segmentation.   Alternative approaches  will be investigated,
              based on avoiding flow computation, and  instead, fitting simple models to the
              structure and motion in small  patches.  The approach to object recognition
              will be to investigate  shape invariants that can be automatically extracted
              from the scene  by learning techniques.  ***
