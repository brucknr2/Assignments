Abstract    :
              9309008  McLaughlin  The Principal Investigator is analyzing and designing
              quantizers  for the compression and transmission of analog signals such as 
              speech, images, video and music across noisy channels such as  satellite links
              or telephone lines.  The research considers joint  source-channel codes, which
              are essentially source codes designed  so that their outputs can be transmitted
              directly across a noisy  channel without channel coding.  The investigator is
              developing  an asymptotic theory, giving insight and direction into the  design
              of locally and possibly globally optimum noisy channel  quantizers. 
              Source-channel codes then will be designed to  achieve or exceed the overall
              system performance of the  traditional approach of tandem source and channel
              coding.  The  award provides support for three years.
