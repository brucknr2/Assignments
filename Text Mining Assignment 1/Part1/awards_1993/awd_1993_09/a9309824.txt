Abstract    :
               The existing research is extended to include   logical-operational
              characterizations of computational complexity,    i.e., applicative calculi and
              proof formalisms.    Various  applications in computing theory and  programming
              methodology also is explored.   The PI introduced a new  approach to proof
              theoretic study of  computational complexity, which was  applied to feasible 
              complexity classes.  That approach is exo-algebraic, i.e.,  referring to free
              algebras within broader structures.  While  earlier work used  second-order
              logic to explicitly define  free algebras, recent work shows that  the
              exo-algebraic  approach can be easily applied also to first-order theories. 
              That approach has the advantages of being free of any  initial functions, of 
              permitting foundational delineations  of complexity classes, of allowing 
              explicit reference to all  computable functions without extending the logic to 
              partially-defined terms, and of having particularly  streamlined proof theory 
              and model theory.    This work (1) applies exo-algebraic formalisms as above 
              to obtain logic-based, machine-independent classifications  of computational 
              complexity classes, thereby relating  computational complexity to fundamental 
              parameters of  logical complexity; (2) uses these characterizations to obtain 
              new relations between computational complexity and    foundations of
              programming, program verification, type    theory, and computational
              mathematics; and (3) applies  the  logic-based characterizations to investigate
              computation  complexity  proper.
