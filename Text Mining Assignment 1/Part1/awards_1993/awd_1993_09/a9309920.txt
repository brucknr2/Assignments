Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides travel support for Dr. John                                
              Cheeseman and a graduate research assistant                                    
              from the Department of Plant Biology at the                                    
              University of Illinois to go to Australia in                                   
              order to conduct cooperative research with                                     
              Dr. Barry Clough of the Australian Institute of                                
              Marine Science (AIMS). The research                                            
              will focus on the control of photosynthesis in                                 
              mangroves under natural conditions. Mangrove                                   
              forests of tropical coasts and estuaries are                                   
              highly productive and essential to the                                         
              maintenance of associated ecosystems.                                          
              Mangroves, noted for their exceptional                                         
              tolerance to high temperatures and light                                       
              intensity as well as salinity, are also a                                      
              notable exception to the rule that plants                                      
              found in demanding environments would grow                                     
              better in less demanding ones but are excluded                                 
              by competition.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The research team will travel to the Daintree                                  
              River estuary in north Queensland where a                                      
              combination of biochemical and biophysical                                     
              approaches will be applied to the problem of                                   
              short term control of photosynthesis in                                        
              mangroves. Among the topics to be investigated                                 
              is the apparent lack of photoinhibitory                                        
              damage to leaves exposed to high light and high                                
              temperatures for prolonged periods with their                                  
              stomates closed.
