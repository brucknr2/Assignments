Abstract    :
              9309566  Fox  The objective of this research is to develop a multi-dimensional 
              creep model for soft soils based on definitive laboratory  experiments. 
              Laboratory creep tests will be performed on an  inorganic clay and a fibrous
              peat under oedometer, triaxial,  simple shear and cuboidal (true triaxial)
              shear conditions.  Data  from the experimental program will be analyzed to
              determine the  nonlinear mathematical relationship between effective stress, 
              strain and strain rate tensors during multiaxial creep  displacement.  The
              developed theory will account for soil cross  isotropy, coupled effects between
              axial, lateral and shear strain  rates and the dependence of creep rate on
              intermediate principal  stress.  Experimental data for the peat will be
              compared with  numerical simulations using a newly developed discrete element 
              model for organic soils.  ***
