Abstract    :
              9309172   Ciric      This project explores the steady state of multiplicity and 
               stability of exothermic reactive distillation columns via a   three part
              study.  The first part of the study unravels the  role   physical properties
              play in steady state multiplicity using a   multiparameter homotopic
              continuation technique.  The second   part of the study evaluates the stability
              of a reactive   distillation column,  This analysis is complicated by a 
              logical   relationship between the amount of liquid runoff and the rate  of  
              change of the liquid holdup on a distillation tray.  This   logical
              relationship creates discontinuities in the dynamic   model, and as a
              consequence, conventional eigenvalue analysis   techniques are inappropriate. 
              An alternative optimization  based   stability test is proposed that readily
              incorporates the   discontinuities.  this optimization based stability test
              will   also be used to find points of marginal stability for a   bifurcation
              diagram.  The third part of the research tests the    numerical predictions
              with physical experiments.   ***
