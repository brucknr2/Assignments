Abstract    :
              9309326  Guzman  The objective of this research is to  study and explore
              alternative  applications of metal chelate  interactions, and to develop 
              reversible and specific protein  separation methods.  Enzymes and  inhibitors
              (bioligands) are to be  coupled to soluble bifunctional  polymers previously
              modified with a  chelating compound at one of the  ends.  These modified 
              chelating-polymer-bioligands will  then be reversibly attached to a  previously
              fixed metal in a solid or  soluble support.  This approach will  allow the
              bioligands to be replaced  whenever their activity is lost by  simply removing
              the metal ion (and  subsequently the  chelate-polymer-bioligand) from the 
              system, leaving the initial chelate  matrix intact.  With this approach, 
              enzymes and specific inhibitors  bearing a chelating ligand for the  fixed
              metal can be attached in a  reversible manner.   ***
