Abstract    :
              9309587 Lee The objectives of this research are:  (i) To advance the current
              state of art numerical methods for modeling optical beam propagation in a
              nonlinear waveguide from two to three spatial dimensions; and, (ii) To explore
              the potential advantages of using the finite element method over the
              conventional finite difference methods.  The new nonlinear hybrid vector finite
              element method (NL HVFEM) proposed herein is a combination of edge elements and
              finite difference methods:  The former is applied to the waveguide cross
              section and the latter to the propagation direction.  In the current
              formulation, we consider three components of the electric field and also
              include the complete tensor description of the nonlinear Kerr medium. 
              Furthermore, we plan to combine the NL HVFEM with graphical pre  and post 
              processings and to implement it on massively parallel computers.  These efforts
              will lead us to a powerful and versatile simulation tool for studying many
              interesting and complex physical phenomena that are not possible to analyze
              presently.  It is believed that the proposed research is not only of scientific
              interests but is also useful for realizing all optical, integrated optics
              devices.   ***
