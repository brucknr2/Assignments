Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award (CAA) to Professor Grassian is                   
              for the investigation of fundamental photochemical reactions of                
              molecules adsorbed on single-crystal metal surfaces.  Pulsed                   
              laser, time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry and infrared                     
              spectrophotometry will be used to analyze the products from                    
              photodecomposition and photodesorption reactions occuring on                   
              the surface of metal particles.  In addition, the TOF                          
              instrumentation will allow the measurement of the angular and                  
              translational energy distributions of the proposed                             
              photooxidation and photohydrogenation reactions.  The goal is                  
              to improve our understanding of photo-induced chemical                         
              reactions which occur on the surface of metal catalysts.

              Career Advancement Awards allow female investigators to                        
              initiate research programs in new or innovative areas of                       
              investigation.  Professor Grassian will use this CAA to expand                 
              her research into the area of photochemistry on the surface of                 
              single-crystal metal particles.  The results will provide                      
              increased knowledge concerning photo-induced chemical reactions                
              observed on catalytic surfaces.
