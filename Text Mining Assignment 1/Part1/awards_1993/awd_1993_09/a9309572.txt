Abstract    :
              9309572  Evripidou  The Decoupled Data-Driven (D3) machine separates the 
              synchronization and computation portions of a program and  executes them
              asynchronously.  The compiler generates threads  that utilize the processor
              pipeline efficiently by reducing  pipeline stalls within a thread.  Priority is
              given to threads  which have their data in close proximity (i.e. in the cache
              or  registers).  Decoupling synchronization and computation ensures  the
              execution pipeline is not interrupted by long synchronization  events.    The
              overall goal of this project is the implementation of the  computation model
              into an abstract machine that will execute on  existing large scale shared
              memory multiprocessors.  Achieving  this goal requires the development of: a
              microtasking environment  that supports the abstract machine on commercial
              machines, a  multi-language compiler that generates code for the abstract 
              machine, and a hardware thread synchronization unit.  ***
