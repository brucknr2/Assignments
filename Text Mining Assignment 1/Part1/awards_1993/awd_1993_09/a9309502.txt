Abstract    :
              9309502  Reh    The development of the eye involves several different 
              interactions to organize the neural network of the retina and  the related
              non-neural pigment epithelium.  During early  developmental stages, cells
              called blastomeres have the  potential to later differentiate into progeny
              cells that can  become a variety of different types.  Later, the type of cell 
              which can arise from further cell divisions becomes more  restricted.  Work on
              transplanted cells from various stages  has shown that both intrinsic genetic
              factors and extrinsic  factors in the developing environment apparently
              influence  these cell fates to some degree.  This project uses an  innovative
              model of "transdifferentiation" and techniques of  immunocytochemistry and
              molecular biology.  The molecular  factors will be examined that determine the
              differences  arising during development between retinal neurons and retinal 
              pigment epithelial cells.  These studies involve the roles of  fibroblast
              growth factors (FGF) and their receptor molecules  as important extrinsic
              factors, and the role of a gene known  as CASH-1 which is expressed in retinal
              neural but not retinal  pigment epithelial cells, as an intrinsic factor in 
              developmental determination.  The results will have an impact  beyond
              developmental neuroscience alone, to understanding  formation of the visual
              system, and will have likely  health-related applications.   ***
