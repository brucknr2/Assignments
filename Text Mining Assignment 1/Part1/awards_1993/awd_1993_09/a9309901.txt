Abstract    :
              9309901  Lawrence       Digital, photometric images of line-of-sight solar
              magnetic  and velocity fields, obtained at high spatial resolution, will be 
              analyzed using modern fractal, wavelet transform and percolation  methods. 
              This study will develop a quantitative, non-  morphological, approach to the
              structural properties of solar  magnetic fields over a range of spatial scales.
               The results of the  analysis will be used to confront random dynamo models of
              the  generation of small-scale photospheric magentic fields, on the one  hand,
              with the observed field distributions, on the other.  ***
