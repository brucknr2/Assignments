Abstract    :
              9309759    Webster  When the hemoglobin gene (vgb) from the  bacterium,
              Vitreoscilla,  is present in recombinant E. coli carrying  the gene for alpha- 
              amylase from Bacillus stearothermophilus, the  production of this  enzyme is
              stimulated.  The main objective of  this project is to  obtain basic
              information about the mechanism  of this stimulation.   The role of the product
              of vgb expression,  Vitreoscilla  hemoglobin (VtHb), will be examined using 
              site-directed  mutagenesis to produce inactive and altered  proteins.  These 
              inactive and altered proteins will then be  tested for a change in  the
              stimulatory effect.  VtHb increases under  hypoxic conditions  and presumably
              functions by facilitating  respiration under these  conditions.  Other planned
              experiments  include extending the  basic findings to other products besides 
              alpha-amylase, and to  other bacterial systems.
