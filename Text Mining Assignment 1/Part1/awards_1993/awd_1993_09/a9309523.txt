Abstract    :
              9309523  Teel  The field of nonlinear control continues to see exciting 
              breakthroughs yet such developments often have a difficult time  finding their
              way into the realm of practical implementation.   The objective of this
              research program is to elaborate on the  theoretical power of nonlinear control
              while at the same time  providing a more solid foundation for the use of
              nonlinear  control tools in engineering applications.  The former will be 
              accomplished by furthering results on inherently nonlinear  control systems and
              control solutions.  The latter will be  achieved by concurrently putting a
              premium on developing  algorithms that are robust and efficient.    This
              research will include further investigation employing time-  varying feedback,
              saturation, hysteresis, dead-zones and  sublinear feedback.  Previous work with
              saturation functions has  already proved very fruitful for globally stabilizing
              critically  unstable linear systems with inputs subject to magnitude 
              constraints, as well as for stabilizing challenging nonlinear  systems. 
              Important progress has also been made in the  development of time-varying
              feedback for the stabilization of  nonholonomic systems.  This time the
              emphasis will be placed in  robustness and practicality by focusing on output
              feedback  solutions and by allowing for uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics.   A
              premium will also be placed on performance, employing computer  simulation at
              this stage to evaluate the design algorithms.  ***
