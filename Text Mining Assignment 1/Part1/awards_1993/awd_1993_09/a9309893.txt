Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There is evidence that malnutrition during childhood causes                    
              systematic dental hypoplasias or deformities of particular kinds.              
                                                                                             
              This is still controversial, because some scientists argue that                
              such hypoplasias are, or can be, the result of heredity, and are               
              "naturally" occurring in different populations.                                
                                                                                             
              This study will establish the rates of dental hypoplasias in                   
              a large series of living individuals who were children during one              
              of the worst and most widespread famines of  human memory - in                 
              China from 1959-1961.   In an examination of over 2,000                        
              individuals in a rural and urban community, it will establish                  
              what the changing rates of hypoplasias were before, during, and                
              after the famine, what the distinctions between urban and rural                
              populations were, and whether sex differences in effects are                   
              apparent.  As the graduate student involved in the project was a               
              "barefoot doctor" in both these areas, access to the populations               
              is assured.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This study will be very important in establishing baseline                     
              data for bioarchaeological reconstructions of human nutrition in               
              past populations, and for nutritional surveys in underdeveloped                
              countries with poor records.
