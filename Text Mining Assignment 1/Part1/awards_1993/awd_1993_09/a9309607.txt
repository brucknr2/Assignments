              proposal, the PI has described a method for transient simulation of
              optoelectronic devices and circuits. The semiconductor equations will be
              represented as equivalent circuit  components and solved using a public domain
              circuit simulator. Besides the inherent advantage of providing mixed mode
              device and circuit simulation capability embedded in a circuit  simulator, this
              technique can also be used for extracting the device  and circuit level model 
              parameters to match measured data through optimization.  The PI  will utilize
              this simulation  tool to develop ultrafast photodetectors and monolithic
              receivers.  There exists a growing consensus that the process, device, and
              circuit simulation tools used  as separate entities need to be integrated into
              a combined simulation environment for efficient  design and optimization of
              semiconductor devices and integrated circuits. The proposed research will
              incorporate the transient device simulation into a public domain circuit
              simulator  providing the researchers with an integrated simulation tool. Such
              integration will shorten  the development cycle for new technologies by
              providing accurate predictions of various physical phenomena on the device and
              circuit level and by allowing the investigation of detailed  device behavior
              within the circuit environment.  Optoelectronic devices are usually
              monolithically integrated with electronic circuits such  as amplifiers,
              especially for high speed applications. For better understanding of OEICs, a 
              simulation tool capable of transient analysis at device level which can be
              directly interfaced  with circuit level components will be invaluable. Besides
              its inherent advantages, mixed mode simulation technique can also be used for
              extracting circuit level model parameters  for new electronic and
              optoelectronic devices. This extraction technique will yield a very  fast
              method for model development for new devices.Using the capability of ac
              curately representing optoelectronic components we will design  novel
              structures. The design efforts will result in new optoelectronic devices and
              circuits  with operation bandwidths approaching 100 GHz. ***
