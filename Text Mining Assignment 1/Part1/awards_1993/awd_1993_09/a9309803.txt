              homogeneous population of cells.  The mechanisms responsible for developing
              these different cell types are still poorly understood.  A family of genes,
              achaete-scute homologues, have been identified whose protein products appear to
              be involved in this process.  Two new members of this family have recently been
              identified and will be further analyzed in this project.  These genes are
              expressed in very specific regions of the developing hindbra in.  These regions
              contain cell that will develop neurons shortly after these genes are first
              expressed.  This project will seek to identify the specific cells that express
              these genes and to determine whether expression of these genes is a
              prerequisite for development of the specific fates of  these cells.  This
              project should make significant inroads into understanding hindbrain
              development and will offer new insights into the more general question of how
              different cell types arise in the nervous system               $             $
