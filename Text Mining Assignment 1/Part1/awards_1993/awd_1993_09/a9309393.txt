Abstract    :
              9309393  Allman    One of the many mysteries of human perception is that after
              seeing  random contours linked together just a few times, observers cannot 
              help but see them as a whole, even when they are later unlinked.  These
              illusory contours have been called "cognitive" contours  because they exist
              only in the mind, not in the stimulus. With this  new three year grant from
              NSF, Dr. Allman will investigate the  neural basis of this phenomenon. In pilot
              work, he has found that  animals develop the ability to see these cognitive
              contours as  rapidly as humans. He has thus created a completely novel paradigm
               for the study of perceptual learning. He will now record in visual  cortex to
              search for the actual neuronal changes that occur during  the formation of the
              perceptual illusion. He will thus be able to  describe the neurobiological
              correlates of a perceptual phenomenon,  making this a first attempt to describe
              events at the mind/brain  interface.             ***
