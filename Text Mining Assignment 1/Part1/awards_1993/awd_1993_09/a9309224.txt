Abstract    :
              9309224  Liebeherr  The Principal Investigator is addressing the research issues
              in  providing deterministic performance guarantees in high speed  networks
              offering integrated services.  The investigator is  analyzing the following key
              components of the network:  service  interface, packet scheduling, admission
              control and service  classes.  The result of the research is an improved
              traffic  characterization, a systematic approach for the evaluation  ofpacket
              schedulers which also considers admission control  issues.  A new class of
              so-called hybrid packet schedulers is  being investigated.  And a novel network
              service which allows a  bounded degradation of quality-of-service is further 
              investigated.  The award provides support for three years.
