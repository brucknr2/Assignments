Abstract    :
              Abstract - Ray/9309055    Tailored particles are finding increasing applications
              in the manufacturing of advanced ceramic materials, electronic and photonic
              devices, catalysts, microencapsulated polymer particles for control release and
              thin film coating.  Some of these processes require monodisperse particles of
              specific size and composition or composite particles (for example layered
              particles), and recent electronic devices based on quantum dots require
              nano-size particles.  Of the current techniques for the production of small
              particles, reactions with aerosols is one of the simplest for the production of
              high purity particles of  a desired size.  Homogeneous, composite, hollow and
              layered particles of desired size can be generated by such techniques where
              composition and structure (along with the size) dictate the possible
              applications of the particles.  The objectives of this research are to
              understand the physical and chemical processes involved in the chemical and
              photochemical reactions in small particles, factors that control the morphology
              and mechanical strength of the final particles, and to develop techniques for
              the generation of tailored particles.    Experiments will be conducted on
              single droplets suspended in an electrodynamic balance and on highly
              monodisperse droplets generated by a vibrating orifice aerosol generator.  An
              elastic scattering technique, based on optical resonance, will be applied for
              the precise determination of the size and the refractive index of a homogeneous
              or a layered droplet during a reaction with the surrounding vapor.  This
              technique, in conjunction with Raman scattering a nd graviometric techniques,
              will provide information on the mass, composition, and porosity of a particle. 
              The pore size distribution in a final solid particle will be analyzed by
              adsorption and desorption of vapors.  To estimate the mechanical strength of an
              inorganic or a polymeric shell covering a core droplet generated by a reaction,
              a technique, based on the relations between the stress and strain for the shell
              and between the osmotic pressure and core composition for a surrounding vapor
              soluble in the core, will be used.  The theory of interaction of light with
              small droplets suggests an efficient way for the utilization of microdroplets
              as photochemical reaction media.  Photochemical reactions requiring high power
              light sources will be examined in microdroplets with low power sources. 
              Whether a photochemical reaction can be limited to region to form a shell of
              desired thickness will also be tested.  The formation of surfactant-free
              emulsions in microdroplets and their use for the generation of nano-size
              particles will also be examined.   / / /   / / / / / /   / /   / / / / / / /
