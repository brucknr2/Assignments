Abstract    :
              9309989  Davenport       This award in experimental elementary particle physics 
              will continue the principal investigator's long involvement  with a large,
              international group who do fixed-target  experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron. 
              Analysis will continue  on the data from E687 runs in 1990 and 1991 and
              preparations  will be made for a run of the follow-on E831, both of which  are
              studies of charm particles produced in hadronic  collisions.  ***
