Abstract    :
              9309371  TURVEY    This research will address how perception of the properties
              of  objects and surfaces can be achieved on the basis of touch and  without
              benefit of vision.  The focus will be on the dynamic touch  system, in which
              perception is tied to circumstances that affect  the muscle and tendon states
              (as when effort is expended in order  to heft an object or strike surrounding
              surfaces with a cane).  In  these experiments, people will wield an unseen
              object to perceive  its length, weight, shape, or orientation, use a cane to
              explore  occluded objects, apertures, and surfaces at a distance, or  oscillate
              a taut strand anchored at both ends to perceive objects  attached to the
              strand.  They will adjust movable surfaces or  visible pointers to quantify the
              perceived properties.  Distance,  length, orientation, and so on, will be
              manipulated.  The  experiments will be directed, first, at identifying the 
              capabilities of the dynamic touch system, i.e., what properties can  be
              perceived reliably, and, second, at the basis of that  perception.  The latter
              will highlight the physical constants that  relate the lawfully varying forces
              and motions; these constants are  assumed to govern perception of object and
              surface properties by  dynamic touch.  Identifying hand-related capabilities
              and the  physical properties that underwrite them will have implications for 
              the design of robotic limbs and prostheses, as well as for the  general theory
              of special purpose cognitive mechanisms.    ***
