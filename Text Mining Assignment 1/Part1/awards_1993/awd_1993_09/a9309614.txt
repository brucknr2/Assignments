Abstract    :
              930964  Fischer  This grant provides continued support for a series of annual   
                  conferences on macroeconomics.  Past conferences have made a  significant
              contribution to the testing of empirical implications  of new theories as well
              as the use of relevant theory to analyze  policy issues of current interest. 
              The conference series will  continue to encourage the writing of empirically
              oriented papers  by both established and promising young economists.  In
              addition,  the series will continue to serve as a forum for communication 
              among economists from the different schools of macroeconomic  thought.  The
              annual conference volume has become a widely cited  and influential research
              reference.  ***
