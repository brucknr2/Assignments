Abstract    :
              This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is                 
              made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Susan T. Graul of the                    
              Chemistry Department, Carnegie Mellon University.  Gas-phase                   
              reactions of oxygen atom radical ions with various organic and                 
              inorganic reagents will be studied in order to elucidate the                   
              mechanisms and dynamics of hydride ion and hydrogen atom                       
              transfer reactions.  Under the planning grant, Dr. Graul will                  
              construct a guided ion beam apparatus and develop theoretical                  
              methods for calculation of velocity distributions that would be                
              compared to experimental results.  The project is relevant to                  
              the study of planetary atmosphere and to combustion.
