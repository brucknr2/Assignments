Abstract    :
              9309850  Fabes    This Americas Program award will support a research 
              conference/workshop in Harmonic Analysis and Operator  Theory to be held in
              Caracas, Venezuela from January  4 through January 8, 1994.  The meeting,
              jointly  organized by Prof. Eugene Fabes of the University of  Minnesota and
              Prof. Wilfredo Urbina of the Universidad  Central de Venezuela, will serve to
              honor Prof. Mischa  Cotlar on his 80th birthday and provide an opportunity  for
              Venezuelan and other Latin American mathematicians  to establish contacts,
              exchange ideas, and develop  cooperative research activities in the subject
              area  with leading mathematicians from the U.S., Europe, and  other Latin
              American countries.    Professor Cotlar's career in Latin America has been 
              notable, not only for his outstanding research but  also for his role in
              educating many of the leading  mathematicians from the region.  The conference
              will  serve to give an overview of the current research  areas in which
              Professor Cotlar is active and will  encourage communication and cooperation
              between the  participants.  ***
