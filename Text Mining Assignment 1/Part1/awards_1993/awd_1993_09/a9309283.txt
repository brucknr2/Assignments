Abstract    :
              9309283  Overstreet    This is a three-year cooperative research project
              proposed by  Drs. Robin Overstreet and William Hawkins, Gulf Coast Research 
              Laboratory, and Professor Peter Lin Sun, Taiwan National Pingtung  Institute of
              Agriculture.  This proposal requests funds for  travel and graduate student
              support to carry out cooperative  research to determine if there are
              identifiable biomarkers in  tilapia for indication different levels of
              pollution.  If  successful and reliable biomarkers in fish for pollution 
              monitoring are found, they can be a quick indication of the  condition of
              aquatic environments.  The study plans to test a new  technique by adapting
              parasitological methods to the field of  biomonitoring.  Taiwan is important
              for this research since   there are relatively abundant accessible warmwater
              fish (tilapia)  living in the different levels of polluted environments.   Dr.
              Peter Sun has noted that the tilapia in the grossly affected  area are showing
              pathological alterations.  The project can  contribute significantly in human
              resource development by  inclusion of graduate student work in systems which
              are very  different from those in the U.S.  This project is jointly  supported
              by the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council  (NSC).
