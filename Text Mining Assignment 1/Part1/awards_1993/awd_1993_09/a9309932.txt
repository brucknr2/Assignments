Abstract    :
              9309932  Coulombe    The nervous system is a communications network made up of
              billions of individuals nerve cells.  Signals are passed between individual
              nerve cells within the nervous system and to other cells, such as muscle cells,
              by the release of  chemicals called neurotransmitters.  More than 40 different
              neurotransmitters have been identified and each of these chemicals has very
              distinct effects within the body.  In order to form a functional nervous system
              it is essential that each nerve cell contain and release only the specific
              neurotransmitters that are appropriate for it's particular function.  The goal
              of this project is to understand some of the ways that the body controls what
              neurotransmitter substances are made by developing nerve cells.  Earlier
              studies examined one set of nerve cells that normally make a neurotransmitter
              substance called somatostatin.  When grown in culture, these nerve cells only
              produce somatostatin when grown together with a specific type of muscle cells. 
              These particular muscle cells produce a substance called activin.  Activin
              released by cultured muscle cells appears to govern the nerve cell's production
              of the neurotransmitter somatostatin.  The experiments proposed here will
              further investigate the role of activin in controlling neurotransmitter
              production during normal development of the nervous system.  Results of  these
              experiments will allow a greater understanding of how cell-to-cell interactions
              are used to control neurotransmitter production in the developing nervous
              system and by extension will contribute to an understanding of the basic
              mechanisms which control dev elopment.  ***
