Abstract    :
              9309169  Dayhoff  This Career Advancement Award is made to Judith Dayhoff to
              study  neural computations on ensembles and intercellular signaling.  
              Extracellular multiunit signals contain significant temporal  structure, such
              as multiunit synchronies, and the PI plans to  extend and apply methods for
              identification of timing  relationships in multiunit recordings.  On
              identification of  timing relationships in multiunit recording, the PI plans to
               implement and characterize a new analysis technique that detects  synchronous
              activity in ensembles of neurons.  This will focus on  nerve impulse trains and
              the temporal placement of nerve impulses  with respect to one another.  The
              time relationships to be  identified are important because synchronously firing
              groups are  candidate mechanisms for neural coding, representation, and 
              processing.  The project includes the implementation of a new  fast calculation
              method for the detection of synchronous firing  in simultaneous nerve impulse
              trains, and validation of the new  computation methods and characterization of
              its sensitivity to  temporal structure in simulated data.  The techniques will
              then  be exported to laboratories actively engaged in mulitunit neural 
              recording.  As follow-on work, this project will stimulate  collaborations
              between the PI and experimental laboratories where  mulitunit recording is
              taking place.  ***
