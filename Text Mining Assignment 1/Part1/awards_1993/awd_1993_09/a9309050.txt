Abstract    :
              9309050  Mayer  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which is
              to formulate and  validate mechanistic relationships for  physical
              nonequilibrium movement of  contaminants in groundwater as a function of  the
              physical properties of the media through  which flow occurs in the unsaturated
              zone  above the water table.  The project involves  experiments with four
              different porous media  derived from a silica sand obtained from  Michigan's
              Keweenaw peninsula containing  little or no organic matter and exhibiting 
              little or no micro-porosity.  The sand will  be separated into four fractions
              based on  particle sizing to obtain the requisite  variations in pore-size
              characteristics  necessary to validate the mathematical models  of flow.    The
              proposal leading to this award was  submitted in response to NSF 92-122,
              Research  Initiation Awards Program Announcement and  Guidelines.  Results are
              expected to improve  the predictive capabilities for transport of  solutes in
              the unsaturated zone.  This in  turn is expected to provide improvement in  the
              ability to predict the movement  characteristics of groundwater pollutants and 
              contaminants for potential use in engineering  design of remediation systems
              for groundwater  polluted by seepage from ponds, surface and  subsurface
              storage tanks and landfills.
