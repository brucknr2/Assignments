Abstract    :
              9309750   Ealick   We propose to implement modern computer hardware in
              combination  with the new X-ray detectors and synchrotron radiation in order 
              to greatly improve the quality and efficiency of X-ray  crystallography data
              obtained from biological macromolecules.   The major task in this
              implementation will be to develop new  computer altorithms for rapid analysis o
              the X-ray diffraction  data.  Not only will these algorithms allow the
              experimenter to  rapidly evaluate the quality of each individual data set, it
              will  also form the basis by which the experimenter can interactiely  evaluate
              the structural results and consequently make more use of  experimental
              resources.
