Abstract    :
              This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is                 
              made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Sandra L. Laursen of the                 
              Department of Chemistry, Kalamazoo College.  The spin triplet                  
              state of the NH (imidogen) radical and its reactivity with                     
              small hydrocarbon molecules in rare-gas matricies of varying                   
              atomic number will be studied.  The use of various rare gases                  
              will control the efficiency of the spin-forbidden dissociation                 
              to the triplet state, and hence the ratio of singlet to triplet                
              concentrations in the initial electronic state.  The goal of                   
              the project is to clarify the role of spin multiplicity in the                 
              dynamics of these and other excited-state reactions.  The                      
              planning grant will support purchase of a tunable light source                 
              crucial to the project and initial studies to define suitable                  
              energy regimes.
