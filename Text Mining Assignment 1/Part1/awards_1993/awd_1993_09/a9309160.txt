Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award for Women is made in the                         
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program                  
              to Dr. Claire A. Tessier of the Chemistry Department,                          
              University of Akron.  Due to impurities, commercially available                
              main-group metal silicides have not proved to be useful                        
              starting materials for further functionalization.  Dr. Tessier                 
              will prepare pure silicides by low temperature routes, study                   
              their reactivity and functionalization, and determine which                    
              impurities in commercially available materials impede or                       
              accelerate reactions.  Solid state NMR and X-ray diffraction                   
              will be used in characterization.  The long term goal of the                   
              research is to synthesize novel polysilanes and metal-silicon                  
              compounds which might serve as precursors to silicon carbide                   
              and solid state transition-metal silicides.  The work                          
              undertaken here will enable Dr. Tessier to expand research                     
              areas in her laboratory and establish an independent research                  
              program.
