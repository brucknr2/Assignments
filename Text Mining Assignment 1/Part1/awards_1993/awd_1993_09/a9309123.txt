Abstract    :
              9309123  Bamieh  The design of robust controllers has progressed significantly
              in  the past decade, resulting in sophisticated design theories and  algorithms
              that produce high performance controllers in the  presence of uncertainty, and
              enabling the designer to probe the  fundamental limits of performance of
              control systems  configurations.  However, theoretical design problems ignore
              some  important implementations issues and constraints, and thus robust 
              control designs tend to be currently used for investigating  limits of
              performance rather than actually producing the  controllers.  The proposed
              research is centered around the idea of  incorporating general implementation
              constraints and requirements  in the theory of robust controller design.  An
              example is the  design of sampled-data controllers with continuous-time 
              performance objectives, which arise from the consideration that  sampled-data
              controllers.  Controller design with implementation  constraints give rise to
              theoretically challenging problems, and  their solution will greatly enhance
              the applicability of robust  control theory to control practice.  ***
