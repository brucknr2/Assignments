              Witanachchi A novel dual laser ablation deposition of technique is proposed for
              the growth of optical films, towards the fabrication of low loss waveguide
              lasers. The proposed vapor phase deposition technique will facilitate the
              formation of epitaxial ND:YAG films on GaAs substrates, that would lead to the
              integrated opto electronic elements, such as diode pumped blue green lasers and
              amplifiers.  The two lasers employed for the deposition process, a long pulse
              (100ns 1us)         ?       CO   2    laser and a short pulse (15ns) excimer
              laser, will interact with the target of the material to be deposited, and
              subsequently, with the laser generated plasma is obtained, complete evaporation
              of the microscopic particulates in the plume leading to the formation of a
              defect free films is expected.  Extensive optical and ion probe diagnostics of
              the laser generated plasma plume will be performed to aid the optimization of
              the particulate free film growth process, and provide a fundamental
              understanding of the dual laser ablation technique.
