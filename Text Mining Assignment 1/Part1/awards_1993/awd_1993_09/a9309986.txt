Abstract    :
              9309986  Hooper    This proposal outlines a combination of electrophysiological 
              experiments and computer simulations on a small, well described  invertebrate
              distributed neural network (the lobster pyloric  network) aimed at elucidating
              these design principles.  The pyloric  network contains neurons with long
              lasting active properties, can  assume multiple functional configurations, and
              produces a rhythmic  multiphase output.  The network has a remarkable dynamic
              property  that may be analogous to the ability to process inputs over a wide 
              temporal range:  it maintains constant phase and duty cycle  relationships
              within the pattern as pattern cycle frequency  changes.  The experimental
              advantages of this preparation allow all  the network's neurons to be
              individually characterized, and the  network to be simulated on the level of
              the individual conductances  of its neurons.  It is thus a excellent
              preparation in which to  study the questions outlined above.  This work will
              show how  cellular and synaptic properties lead to emergent network  functional
              properties, and elucidate fundamental mechanisms of  dynamic regulation in
              distributed neural networks.***
