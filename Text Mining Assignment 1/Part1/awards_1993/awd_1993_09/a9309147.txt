Abstract    :
              9309147  Cote  The general aim of this research is to determine if a 
              multispectral optical method can be used to develop a sensor for  glucose
              concentrations.  The proposed technique will allow the  measurements to be made
              noninvasively from the anterior chamber  of the eye.  Since the measurements
              are noninvasive, this  technique could replace the invasive techniques
              presently used  and thus allow more frequent monitoring than is presently done.
                 This research is important since it should enable glucose  concentrations to
              be controlled better in patients with diabetes  mellitus and thus help to
              prevent complications that arise from  this chronic disease.  ***
