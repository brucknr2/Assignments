Abstract    :
              9309871  ARLEN  This project will conduct the first economic analysis of the
              impact  of criminal sanctions on corporations' expenditures on crime 
              prevention and detection ("enforcement").  Corporate enforcement  costs warrant
              consideration because a central goal of corporate  criminal sanctions is to
              deter criminal activity by inducing  corporations to spend resources on
              preventing employee crime.  The  first section of the project will consider the
              current trend in  sentencing reform towards increased criminal fines for
              corporate  offenders, and the validity of the conventional wisdom that higher 
              criminal fines increase corporations' willingness to spend  resources to
              prevent their employees from committing crimes.  The  project then will
              determine what magnitude of corporate criminal  fine induces corporations to
              spend the efficient amount of  resources on crime prevention and detection
              under the current  regime of strict vicarious corporate liability.      This
              project can be expected to yield important insights because  its focus on
              corporate enforcement expenditures forces recognition,  for the first time, of
              corporations' conflicting incentives.  On  the one hand, criminal liability
              increases a corporation's  incentives to spend resources on crime detection
              because these  expenditures deter employees from committing crimes; on the
              other  hand, corporations recognize that their enforcement efforts may 
              increase the probability that their agents' crimes will be  detected, thereby
              increasing the probability that the corporation  itself will be subject to
              criminal liability.  The Principal  Investigator will employ mathematical
              modelling techniques.  ***
