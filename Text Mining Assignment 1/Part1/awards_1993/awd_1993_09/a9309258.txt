Abstract    :
              9309258   Tsuchitani     Hearing with two ears (binaural) is much better than
              with just one  (monaural) for detecting and locating sound sources, and 
              understanding speech in a noisy background.  Within the mammalian  brain, in
              the brainstem, there is a structure called the superior  olivary complex that
              is the first place in the auditory pathway  directly involved in the neural
              processing that underlies binaural  hearing.  This complex contains nerve cells
              formed into groups  called nuclei.  Two of these are the lateral superior olive
              nucleus  (LSO), and the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body.  Both are part 
              of  a neural network, the LSO network, that is specifically  involved in
              binaural processing of mid- to high-frequency sounds,  those above 1.5kHz. 
              This work is a collaboration between a sensory  neurophysiologist and a
              signal-processing theorist using an  interdisciplinary approach.  Responses of
              neurons in the LSO  network are recorded for controlled acoustic stimuli which 
              approximate normal "free-field" binaural conditions, and  computational models
              describe how these responses devleop the  neural representation of binaural
              signals.  Signal array processing  techniques also will be used to determine
              the consequent  contributions of the LSO network to binaural perception.  This
              work  will have impact beyond auditory neuroscience to sensory processing  in
              general, to computational modelling of networks, and to devices  for aiding or
              enhancing hearing capabilities.  ***
