Abstract    :
              9309044  Paris  The Principal Investigator is addressing the estimation of the 
              most likely state sequence of a discrete-time finite-state Markov  process with
              unknown parameters observed in independent noise.  A  maximum likelihood
              criterion over both the input sequence and the  parameters is introduced for
              estimating the state sequence  without using an embedded training sequence. 
              Asymptotically,  this estimator is expected to be close to the
              maximum-likelihood  sequence estimator with completely known parameters.  To 
              facilitate the search for the most likely state sequence, the  investigator is
              introducing computationally simple algorithms  which are guaranteed to
              converge.  Besides developing the  underlying theory and algorithms, the
              research is focussing on  applications to digital mobile radio communication
              systems.  The  award provides support for three years.
