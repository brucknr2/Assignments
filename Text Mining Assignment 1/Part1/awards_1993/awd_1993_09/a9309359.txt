Abstract    :
              9309359  Brooks  The objective of this Research  Initiation Award is to develop 
              improved methods to extract maximal  information about cardiac electrical 
              activity from non-invasive  measurements on the torso surface.   Both
              time-domain and frequency  domain characterizations will be  used to develop
              realistic  constraints for a refined inverse  solution.    This research is
              important since it  has the potential to substantially  improve noninvasive
              diagnosis of  cardiovascular disease.  The  research may also have applications
               in solving other inverse problems in  other areas that are ill-  conditioned.
