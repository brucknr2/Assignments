Abstract    :
              9309270 Runger          The objective of this work is a comprehensive, optimal
              solution to the design of an adaptive statistical process control (SPC)
              algorithm.  The work will develop adaptive algorithms for SPC that optimize the
              fundamental design parameters of an SPC algorithm.  The system is adaptive in
              the sense that it has the capability to dynamically vary elements, such as
              sampling intervals and sample sizes, based on the deviations of the measured
              variable from its target value.  One phase of the research will use a semi
              economic model to relate total system cost to system design parameters.        
               This research will optimize adaptive SPC systems.  Process control in
              manufacturing operations will be improved by these techniques.  The result is
              the ability to identify a process which is off target much faster, without
              additional false alarms, and without additional samples.  This translates to a
              more powerful process control system, which results in lower manufacturing
              costs and better quality.  A software system which will provide guidance in
              designing an adaptive SPC system will provide a means of quickly transferring a
              significant, new technology to industry.
