Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to examine the effect of                     
              some important soil variables under controlled laboratory                      
              conditions on supercritical extraction of polychlorinated                      
              biphenyls (PCBs) from soils. Furthermore, it is also                           
              proposed to evaluate the properties of soils before and                        
              after supercritical extraction is performed. Numerous                          
              sites in this country are contaminated with  PCBs. The                         
              remediation of PCB contaminated sites requires the                             
              excavation and treatment of the contaminated soil. This                        
              information this research will provide is required before                      
              treated soil can be safely returned to its original site.
