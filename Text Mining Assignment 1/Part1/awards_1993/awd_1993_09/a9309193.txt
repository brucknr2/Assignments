Abstract    :
                   The project increases the quality of mechanical products                  
              through the development of methodologies to evaluate and improve               
              the diagnosability (a measure of the ability to isolate system                 
              faults) of these products concurrent with the conceptual and                   
              embodiment phases of the design process.  The increase in quality              
              results from reduced loss of functionality and lower life cycle                
              costs for products designed using these methodologies.                         
                   The methodologies are developed through the functional                    
              decomposition and form to function mapping of existing test bed                
              products, and through the redesign of those products for increased             
              diagnosability.  The procedures are similar to and integrated with             
              the other aspects of the concurrent engineering process.
