Abstract    :
                   The research activities proposed entail studies in                        
              reparameterization of statistical models. Progress in this                     
              direction is expected to lead to efficiency in applying                        
              techniques of numerical optimization and integration algorithms                
              to asymptotic normal approximation methods used in statistical                 
              analysis.
