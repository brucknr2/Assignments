Abstract    :
              9309298 Stiling          The gall fly,    Asphondylia        borrichiae,   
              develops internally in galls which form at the apical meristems of sea oxeye
              daisy,    Borrichia       frutescens.     Larvae feed on an obligate fungus
              which they initiate in the gall cavity.  Along the west central coast of
              Florida, local populations of    B.       frutescens    are found only on small
              barrier islands and small "spoil" islands and adjacent to the intracoastal
              waterway. Gall densities between islands vary by as much as 2 3 orders of
              magnitude.  This could be because: (1) some patches of sea oxeye are unsuitable
              for galls (i.e of poor quality or genetically resistant), (2) some sites fail
              to be discovered by the files, (3) some sites encourage high levels of attack
              by natural enemies or (4) on some islands, gall files have become locally
              adapted to existing host patches (i.e. deme formation).                    
              Three sets of experiments will assess the importance of plant clone, attack
              levels of natural enemies and gall fly dispersal and local adaptation on gall
              midge population dynamics: (1) reciprocal transplants of gall free plants
              between sites, (2) reciprocal transplant of galled plants between sites and (3)
              reciprocal transplant of plants that have been maintained in a common garden
              for one year to remove maternal effects. %%% This system will allow research
              that has rarely been possible in the past  understand the factors controlling a
              four trophic level system.  On a more practical level, this project may
              identify the reasons why some patches or genotypes of sea oxeye are resistant
              to damaging herbivorous insects while others are not.  This is important
              because this plant and several  other coastal and dune plants suffer high rates
              of attack by galling insects.  Understanding the reasons behind their different
              rates of attack may greatly aid in selecting the most insect resistant species
              and genotypes for marsh and beach restoration projects.
