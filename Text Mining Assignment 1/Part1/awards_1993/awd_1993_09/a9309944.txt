Abstract    :
              This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is                 
              made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Martha Reynolds of the                   
              Chemistry Department, Colgate University.  Multinuclear NMR and                
              IR spectroscopies will be used to probe metal-catalyzed                        
              oxidative brominations.  During the planning period, Dr.                       
              Reynolds will spend an extended period in the laboratories of                  
              Dr. Alison Butler of the University of California at Santa                     
              Barbara learning the needed instrumental techniques and                        
              assessing the feasibility of these mthods for studying the                     
              oxidation of bromide by peroxometal complexes.  This research                  
              will form the basis for subsequent work on synthetic analogues                 
              of the enzyme vanadium bromoperoxidase.  The project is                        
              relevant to halogenation reactions widely used for organic                     
              synthesis by the pharaceutical industry and to studies of                      
              atmospheric bromoform.
