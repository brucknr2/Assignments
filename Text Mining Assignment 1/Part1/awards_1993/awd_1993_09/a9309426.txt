Abstract    :
              9309426  Lutchen  The goal of this study is to develop a unified approach for 
              applying linear and nonlinear systems identification techniques  to study
              physiological systems at low frequencies.  Nonlinear  procedures, including
              kernel and block structure identification  techniques, will be used.  The
              investigators will also develop  statistical and sensitivity analyses
              procedures to determine the  reliability of the approaches.  The proposed study
              is an  extension of the previously supported research that found  limitations
              in use of standard ventilator waveforms for studying  the respiratory system.  
               This research is important in order to advance the understanding  of nonlinear
              systems that operate at low frequencies; namely, the  respiratory and the
              cardiovascular systems.  The research could  potentially lead to the
              development of noninvasive methods to  evaluate the mechanics of respiration of
              ventilator dependent  patients.  ***
