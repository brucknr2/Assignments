Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This proposal, from the American Astronomical                                  
              Society ?AAS!, for "Astrophysical Research in the                              
              Countries of the Former Soviet Union ?FSU!, led                                
              by principal investigators Dr. S.E. Woosley, Dr.                               
              S. Wolff, Dr. J. Bahcall, and Dr. P. Boyce,                                    
              follows up on a collaborative program of support                               
              for the beleaguered astronomy community in the                                 
              FSU which began in 1991.  This program consisted                               
              of small, $100 grants which eventually were                                    
              awarded to 377 individuals, and astronomical                                   
              journal subscriptions sent to 30 institutions.                                 
              The 1992 program was supported entirely by AAS                                 
              member contributions of $55,000.  During 1993,                                 
              the AAS proposes to continue this program -- and                               
              possibly for several years thereafter -- at an                                 
              expanded level.  Approximately the same number of                              
              journal subscriptions would be provided, but                                   
              grants would be, on the average, four times                                    
              larger.  The AAS would also provide 25 to 30                                   
              personal computers of the PC-486 class.                                        
              Donations from AAS members alone would be                                      
              inadequate to support such a program in 1993.                                  
                                                                                             
              The goal of this AAS program is to keep a core of                              
              young, productive research astronomers and                                     
              astrophysicists functioning within the FSU, and                                
              fulfills the NSF program objectives of advancing                               
              science by preserving the opportunity for leading                              
              experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine                                      
              complementary talents and pool research resources                              
              in areas of strong mutual interest and                                         
              competence.
