Abstract    :
              Adaptive strategies for the optimal trace-and-replay                           
              debugging of parallel and sequential programs will be                          
              developed.  As parallel machines become larger and                             
              processors become faster, the increasing tracing bottleneck                    
              is preventing the development of sophisticated trace-based                     
              tools necessary for debugging.  Our objectives to alleviate                    
              this problem are twofold.  First, we will explore the                          
              theoretical lower bounds on what must be traced to provide                     
              execution replay.  We will investigate which messages,                         
              shared-memory references, or local variable accesses need be                   
              traced to replay any part of the execution in a bounded                        
              amount of time.  By bounding replay time, we provide a fixed                   
              response time to debugging queries, even for large-scale or                    
              long-running programs.  Second, we will develop optimal or                     
              near-optimal strategies that adapt to the execution being                      
              debugged.  Our algorithms make run-time tracing decisions to                   
              adapt to what the execution will be doing next, and keep                       
              traces optimally small. ***
