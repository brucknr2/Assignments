Abstract    :
                Optimization problems that arise in computational    and other related areas
              are investigated in this  project.    Special emphasis  is placed on
              bi-criteria  optimization problems and geometric   problems.  In a 
              communication network, the two important   criteria that are of  great
              practical implications are the communication delay and    total cost.  In  path
              planning routing, the two important  criteria are the   total length and the 
              number of bends.   Optimization problems concerning two   criteria either 
              simultaneously or in lexicographical order are studied.     Among those to be 
              studied are weighted  farthest neighbor Voronoi diagram   construction for a 
              set of  point sites, a new class of geometric problems,   called the 
              capacitated  path problem, in which the obstacles have  capacities and the  
              cost of a path  avoiding these obstacles is  a function of the length of the  
              path and the  capacities of the  obstacles visited by the path, and routing  
              problems with  multiple source-destination pairs such that these paths do   not
               cross and yet  their total length is to be minimized.  The  goals of this  
              research are to apply  geometric techniques to  tackle these new classes of  
              optimization problems, and  to  identify problems that can (or cannot) benefit
              from the    geometric properties.
