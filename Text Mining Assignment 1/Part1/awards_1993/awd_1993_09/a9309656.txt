Abstract    :
              Galton         This research is evaluating the viability of and will  further
              develop a novel technique for simultaneously performing  the previously
              separate operations of phase-tracking and A/D  conversion. The technique gives
              rise to a family of systems  referred to as Sigma-Delta Frequency-to-Digital
              Converters  (SDFDCs), and offers the potential of significant reductions in 
              analog circuit requirements for a variety of applications. Each  system uses
              coarse analog phase measurements, quantization noise  shaping, and decimation
              filtering to perform instantaneous  frequency-to-digital conversion. Because
              they operate on  instantaneous frequency in the manner that SD modulators
              operate  on amplitude, they share many of the benefits enjoyed by SD 
              modulator-based A/D converters such as reduced analog circuit  requirements and
              amenability to VLSI implementation. The research  is developing rigorous
              theoretical results supported by  simulations with the goal of characterizing
              SDFDC performance. A  VLSI prototype targeted to a specific application will
              also be  developed.
