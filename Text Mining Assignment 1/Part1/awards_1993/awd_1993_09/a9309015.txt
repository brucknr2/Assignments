Abstract    :
              9309015 Eberhardt  This is a standard award for Research Initiation to
              investigate several mechanisms for haptic transmission of graphical computer
              interface features, using four specially modified pointing devices.  The haptic
              sensory channel, which includes tactile and kinesthetic components, is capable
              of receiving high information rates, as demonstrated by skills such as haptic
              only speech reception and fine textural discrimination.  Studies are
              determining whether four haptic displays conveying (selectable) object position
              are capable of improving computer productivity (such as overcoming limitations
              in positioning the cursor) as measured with metrics for object acquisition and
              text manipulation speeds, as well as with subjective measures.  The first
              pointing device considered is a mouse with onset or offset of vibro tactile
              stimulation signaling whether the cursor is or not over a selected object.  The
              second is also a mouse but in this case its surface may be raised or not by the
              computer for display of the contour of the object to which we point.  The third
              is a trackball with force feedback implemented via x  and y directional
              friction brakes, for haptic guidance towards selectable features.  Finally, the
              fourth device is a contour display mouse mounted on an x y table allowing user
              controlled movements and force feedback via servo motors.  This research sheds
              light on whether force feedback aids or hinders manipulation speed, haptic 
              receptive capabilities, and effects of bimodal perception.  The devices may be
              useful also to facilitate the use of computers by individuals with impaired
              vision and with neuro muscular disorders.
