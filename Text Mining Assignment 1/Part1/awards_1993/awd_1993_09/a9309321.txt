Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded under a Research Initiation Award, research on unsteady                 
              turbulent jets will be carried out. The investigation will be                  
              experimental. Various acceleration and decelaration rates of                   
              the jet flow rate will be explored to determine the effect of                  
              various types of flow pulsations of mixing, spreading and                      
              turbulence characteristics within the jet.                                     
                                                                                             
              Relevance of the research is to intermittent burners, ejector                  
              type thrusters, and unsteady pollution dispersal.
