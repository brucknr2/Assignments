Abstract    :
              This is a Career Advancement Award which will support the                      
              Sabbatical research of the PI.  This grant will allow the PI to                
              extend her research into the digital hardware/software area.  She              
              will work at IIT on the design of low-power, battery-operated,                 
              limited-memory devices for implantable debribillators.  Her                    
              present area of expertise is in the area of signal processing                  
              algorithms to detect cardiac arrhythmia and therefore this                     
              project will allow her to implement some of the algorithms in                  
              hardware and gain practical experience in this field.
