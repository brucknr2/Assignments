Abstract    :
              9309181  Henriquez  The objectives of the research initiation grant is to
              develop a  mathematical model of cardiac tissue for evaluating the  sensitivity
              of various types of electrogram recordings at the  surface to changes in the
              underlying spread of electrical  activation.  Both unipolar and monophasic
              action potential  electrograms will be modeled and two and three dimensional 
              bidomain models of cardiac tissue will be used.  This study will  include
              complex activation fronts including reentry.    This research is important
              since it could lead to the improvement  of the utility of extracellular
              measurements for a variety of  electrophysiological procedures.  ***
