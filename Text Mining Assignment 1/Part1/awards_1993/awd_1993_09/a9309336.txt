Abstract    :
              9309336  Shor  The design of dynamical systems, modelling for control design, 
              and the design of effective controllers are inter-related.  Yet  generally
              system design is completed before control modelling and  controller design are
              begun.  Design choices upstream will affect  both the achievability of
              desirable controlled system properties  and the simplicity of the final overall
              design.  The integration  of these stages of design is necessary to remedy the
              current  situation.  The research deals with control problems that assist  in
              the understanding of how dynamical system design affects the  achievability of
              certain control objectives.  The solution of  these problems may lead to the
              development of CAD tools for  design engineers to employ to evaluate the
              effects of their  design on the achievability of those objectives.     ***
