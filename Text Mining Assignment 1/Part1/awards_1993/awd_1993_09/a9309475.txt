Abstract    :
              9309475  Lam       This research will carry out queuing and delay analysis when 
              a number of traffic streams are multiplexed in several stages.  The  first step
              will be to model the output process from a single first  stage asynchronous
              transfer mode (ATM) multiplexer.  Various models  will be considered.  Based on
              these models, performance measures  will be investigated including cell loss
              probability, delay and  delay jitter experienced in multistage multiplexing. 
              The aim is to  derive algorithms and deterministic or stochastic bounds for
              these  performance measures.  Both exact and asymptotic methods will be  used. 
                     The performance of  multiplexing traffic streams in several  stages will
              be compared to the results obtained using a single  giant (one stage)
              multiplexer.  This research is of considerable  importance in the formulation
              of requirements for Broadband  Integrated Digital Networks (BISDN) equipment
              since cell loss or  cell delay must be at a level acceptable from network
              performance  and service perspectives.
