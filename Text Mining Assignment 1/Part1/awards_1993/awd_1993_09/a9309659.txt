Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Models of chemical processing systems may be affected by                       
              varying degrees of error.  In many substances reasonable                       
              bounds on the extent of the errors can be determined                           
              quantitatively.  In particular, ellipsoidal confidence                         
              regions-- certainty models-- can be generated as a by product                  
              of efforts to model process plants.  This project addresses                    
              the design of robust controllers capable of satisfying                         
              performance and stability specifications for a normal plant as                 
              well as for all plants belonging to a neighboring ellipsoidal                  
              uncertainty region.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this research are to (1) develop a                           
              comprehensive methodology for analyzing the robustness of                      
              systems with ellipsoidally uncertain plants, (2) produce tools                 
              for synthesizing robust controllers for such plants, and test                  
              and evaluate the resulting control strategies via simulation                   
              studies.  The analysis of robustness will be carried out by                    
              extending the results of a frequency-domain technique which                    
              leads to a simple necessary and sufficient condition for                       
              robust stability.  New synthesis methods are planned using                     
              generic control structures as well as specialized designs such                 
              as pole-placement.  Computer simulation studies of chemical                    
              engineering systems will be used to critically evaluate the                    
              new control strategies using systems of relevance to the                       
              chemical processing industry.
