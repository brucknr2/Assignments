                9309870 Freschi  The purpose of Dr. Freschi's research is to learn how the
              brain produces simple forms of behavior.  In these studies, a simplified
              "brain" or ganglion, which controls the heartbeat in invertebrates will be
              used.  This cardiac ganglion contains only 9 nerve cells (or neurons), so it is
              relatively easy to study.  The cardiac ganglion must receive input from other
              parts of the nervous system, from circulating hormones, and from the heart
              muscle its elf, and then integrate this information to finally produce an
              output that regulates the heartbeat in a way appropriate to the animal's needs.
               How can such a simple neural network produce a behavioral output that is
              capable of changing to suit the animal's needs?  Even though the wiring of the
              circuit is fixed, its output is not.  One of the ways output from the network
              can be changed is by altering the properties of one of the component cells in
              the network.  A chemical that changes the properties of a part of the network
              is called a neuromodulator.  In this research, Dr. Freschi will learn how
              certain neuromodulators (acetylcholine and proctolin) cause changes in
              component neurons of the cardiac ganglion.  He will study how the electrical
              properties of neurons are changed and what biochemical processes are
              responsible for those changes.  He will use electrophysiological techniques to
              measure the electrical changes in nerve cells, biochemical techniques to
              measure intracellular chemical changes caused by neuromodulators, and
              histochemical techniques to measure the location of various neuromodulators or
              neurotransmitter chemicals that are affected by neuromodulators. ***
