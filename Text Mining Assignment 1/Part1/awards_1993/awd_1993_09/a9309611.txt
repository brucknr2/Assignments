Abstract    :
              9309611  Oberdick    The cerebellum is a brain region that is critical for the
              coordination of movement. Much is known about the structure and function of the
              cerebellum.  One striking characteristic of the cerebellum is that it is
              divided into a series of modules.  Each module has a unique set of input and
              output connections with other brain regions. Each module appears to subserve a
              specific movement function for a discrete part of the body. This project will
              seek to understand how the different modules become delineated during
              development. Specific genes will be identified that are responsible for this
              process in the cerebellum. The results of this study will offer new insights
              into how regional differences develop in the brain.  ***    tspool  NETWORK
