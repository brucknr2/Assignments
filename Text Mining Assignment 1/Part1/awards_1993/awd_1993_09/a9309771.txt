Abstract    :
              9309771  Margoliash    One of the most exciting and fruitful model systems in 
              neuroethology is learned bird song.  Adult male songbirds have  unique song
              repertoires which they use to defend territories and  attract mates. 
              Production of these songs is under the control of  an elaborate system of brain
              nuclei whose development parallels the  emergence of crystalized (nonplastic)
              song.  These developmental  processes are influenced by auditory feedback and
              steroid hormones.   This NSF grant will enable Dr. Margoliash to purchase
              equipment to  set up a novel method of tracing the connections between these 
              brain nuclei.  Using these novel techniques he will be able to  determine how
              auditory information is transmitted from the sensory  nuclei to the executive
              system that patterns song.  This  information will be important for our
              understanding of the  development of complex behaviors, sexual differentiation
              and the  design of feedback controlled neural networks and robotics 
              systems.***
