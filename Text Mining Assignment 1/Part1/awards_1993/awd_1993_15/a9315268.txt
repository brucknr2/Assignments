Abstract    :
              9315268  Herbig    Studies of the Diffuse Interstellar Bands.    The enigma of
              the Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) remains one of the  outstanding problems
              of astronomical spectroscopy.  Clearly their carriers  are fairly common
              constituents of the interstellar medium yet remain  unidentified despite some
              60 years of effort.  Dr. Herbig, at the University  of Hawaii, will continue
              his research into the nature of DIBs.  Specifically  he will investigate
              whether polycarbon or chlorin molecules may be  responsible for some DIBs. 
              Efforts will also be made to determine if  sodium atoms trapped in carbon 60
              cages produce a DIB near 1.03  micrometers wavelength, whether DIBs can be
              detected in the ejected  envelopes of carbon stars by spectroscopy of their
              companions, and  whether there is a detectable enhancement of the DIBs in light
              scattered  off the dust of reflection nebulae.
