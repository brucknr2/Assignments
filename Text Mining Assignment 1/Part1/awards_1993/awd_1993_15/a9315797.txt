Abstract    :
              9315797  San  This project is on research to  redirect, by a genetic
              perturbation,  the cellular carbon fluxes in E.  coli in order to reduce
              acetate  production.  Decreased acetate  formation is intended to reduce 
              product inhibition and thereby  increase both recombinant protein  production
              and cell growth.  The  decrease in acetate is caused by the  introduction of a
              Bacillus  acetolactate synthesis gene (ALS)  which causes an increase in the 
              formation of acetoin.  This research  will be an example of the use of 
              metabolic engineering to increase  product yields.  The effect of the  added
              ALS gene on the redistribution  of various reaction fluxes,  especially those
              associated with the  pyruvate branch point, will be the  focal point of this
              research.  In  addition, the modeling and analysis  of these flux changes will
              be  performed by adapting established  pathway analysis methodologies.  ***
