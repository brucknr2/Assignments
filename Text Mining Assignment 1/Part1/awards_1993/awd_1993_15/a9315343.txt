Abstract    :
              9315343  Graham  This project will determine grain boundary diffusivities in 
              enstatite, olivine, and diopside polycrystals as a function  of temperature,
              oxygen fugacity (using CO/CO2 mixtures), and  iron (and calcium in diopside)
              content.  The effects of  water (and hydrogen) fugacity on grain boundary
              diffusivity  will be investigated by performing experiments using H2/H2O  gas
              mixtures to control the oxygen fugacity.  The research  will elucidate the role
              of grain boundaries as conduits for  ionic and electronic transport, which are
              important  phenomena in both geosciences and materials sciences.
