Abstract    :
              9315684  Hudlicky  The focus of this research will be fourfold.  New aromatic 
              substrates will be screened for oxidation by Pseudomonas Putida  39/D to
              broaden the applicability of this method.  Potassium  permanganate oxidation of
              dienes will be investigated as an  alternative to ozonolysis.  Syntheses of
              sugars, cyclitols,  sphingolipids and alkaloids will demonstrate the efficiency
              of  the biocatalytic strategy and fourth, mass balance of reagents  and waste
              output will be assessed for each preparation in order  to minimize organic
              byproducts produced during manufacture.    With this Environmentally Benign
              Chemical Synthesis and  Processing award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting  the research of Dr. Tomas Hudlicky of the Department of  Chemistry
              at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State  University.  Professor
              Hudlicky, collaborating with Genencor  International, will focus his work on
              developing a new strategy  for the reduction of pollution at its source.  The
              strategy  rests on the assumption that, instead of incineration or other  means
              of disposal, homogeneous waste or solvents would be  subjected to microbial
              oxidation by Pseudomonas Putida 39/D to  produce arene cis-diols which are
              ideally suited for short and  environmentaly benign conversions to useful
              organic compounds.  ***
