Abstract    :
              9315903  Bigio       This is investigate the feasibility of developing global 
              measures of mixing to be used in the evaluation of mixer designs  and to
              compare the performance of various mixing configurations  based on mixing
              performance.  The quantitative evaluation of mixing  extent is a critical
              problem in polymer and elastomer processing  and the proposed approach, which
              attempts to develop a quantitative  relationship between the global details of
              mixing and chaos theory,  is a novel one.       If an easily evaluated, global
              measure of mixing can be  developed, the selection and optimization of the
              mixing aspects  polymer and elastomer processing can be quantitatively
              evaluated.   At present, materials are typically "overmixed" because of 
              uncertainty in the mixing efficiency.  Such practices are both time  and energy
              inefficient.
