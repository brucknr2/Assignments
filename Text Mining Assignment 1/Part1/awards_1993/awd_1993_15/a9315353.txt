Abstract    :
              9315353    Taylor    This award supports a paleobotanical study of Permian and
              Triassic   sedimentary rocks in the Shackleton Glacier portion of the  Central 
              Transantarctic Mountains.  This project represents a  continuation  of research
              to elucidate the paleobiology and  biostratigraphy of  the late Paleozoic and
              early Mesozoic of  Antarctic.  The  Shackleton Glacier region is known to have 
              abundant fossil plants  but there has never been an attempt to  systematically
              collect and  describe the flora in detail.  Fossils  that have been reported 
              include fossil forests, permineralized  peat deposits,  compression/impression
              floras, and palynomorphs  (pollen).  This  award provides support for
              collection,  description, and  paleoenvironmental interpretation of these 
              Permian and Triassic  plant fossils.  These fossils, including  analysis of
              tree rings,  is an essential component of  paleoenvironmental reconstructions 
              for the Permo-Triassic and  provides an important method of testing 
              paleoclimatic models for  the region.     ***
