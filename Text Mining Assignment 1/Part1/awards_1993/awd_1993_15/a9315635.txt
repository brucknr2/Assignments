Abstract    :
              9315635  Wudl    We will prepare and investigate a broad class of conjugated 
              polymers which should exhibit improved environmental stability in  the doped
              and undoped states and will be easily n-dopable.  Some of  these polymers, when
              processed, will have high strength while  retaining the unusual electronic
              character of the conjugated  polymers.  Other members of the class will be
              polyelectrolytes  based on stable carbanions.  Still other polymers will be
              n-self-  doped polymers.  This group of polymers lends itself to the 
              development of the concept of base-doping of conducting polymers  concept which
              is complementary to acid doping of polyaniline  emeraldine base.  Two
              approaches will be pursued:  (a) preparation  of polymers where a number of
              cyanides are directly attached to the  backbone and (b) preparation of polymers
              where a Huckel driving  force is the principle for n-doping of the backbone. 
              Once  prepared, in collaboration with Professor Heeger's group in our 
              Institute, the new polymeric materials will have their optical and  electronic
              properties determined.    These polymeric materials have potential applications
              as structural  materials, as nonlinear optics substrates, as organic light 
              emitting diode components, as all polymer p-n junction diodes, and  as battery
              electrodes for all-polymer batteries and high-energy  density batteries.  ***
