Abstract    :
              9315370  Granados    This award support the participation of 10 U.S.  scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Molecular  Biology and Genetic Engineering of 
              Biopesticides for Insect Control, scheduled for  November 1994 in Kyoto, Japan.
               The co-  organizers are Professor Robert Granados, Boyce  Thompson Institute
              for Plant Research, Cornell  University, and Professor Tsuguo Matsumoto,  Kyoto
              Institute of Technology.  The seminar  will focus on the genetic engineering of
              insect  pathogens used as biopesticides, development of  a greater
              understanding of the molecular  interactions between pathogenic microbes and 
              their insect hosts, and improvement of  biological control tactics for insect
              pests and  vectors using these new agents and knowledge.    The seminar will
              bring together leading  scientists from the two countries who  specialize in
              the area of biological control to  address novel molecular approaches for the 
              genetic manipulation of microorganisms for  insect control.  The seminar has a 
              multidisciplinary character of contemporary  research on insect pathogens and
              will impact  the areas of biological, environmental,  agricultural, and medical
              sciences.  In  particular, the exchange of information will  accelerate the
              development of new strategies  and tactics for controlling harmful insects 
              that account for agricultural, medical, and  veterinary problems.  ***
