Abstract    :
              9315857  Poliakoff  In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry
              Program  of the Chemistry Division, Erwin Poliakoff of Louisiana State 
              University will pursue highly resolved studies of resonant  photoionization
              using synchrotron radiation as the excitation  source.  The deposition and
              partitioning of energy in the  product ions will be determined from dispersed
              fluorescence.  Highly resolved data are thus accessible over a broad electron 
              energy range to help elucidate the photoejection dynamics.  These data will be
              applied to systems which are vibrationally  resolved for polyatomic targets and
              rotationally resolved for  diatomic molecules.  %%%  In the experiments
              performed in this project, the motions that  electrons make when molecules
              dissociate under the influence of  high energy light will be correlated with
              the motions of the  nuclei.  The light used in these studies will come in part
              from  a synchrotron radiation source at Louisiana State University.  The data
              acquired in these studies is inaccessible by other  techniques and will be used
              to guide and shape theoretical  models for these processes.  ***
