Abstract    :
                9315060  Shearer    This research is a continuation of the investigation of
              the velocity structure of the earth by  means of stacking seismograms from the
              global seismic networks.  Current versions of these  stacks have successfully
              imaged dozens of seismic phases including many reflections from upper  mantle
              discontinuities.  Analyses of these phases have provided new evidence for a
              discontinuity  at 520-km depth and maps of the topography of the 410 and 660-km
              discontinuities.  This work  will improve the stacking techniques to
              accommodate both higher and lower frequency data, and  apply these methods to
              the broadband data from the IRIS network.  The goals are to obtain  improved
              maps of the structure of internal discontinuities in the mantle, begin
              experimenting  with automatic waveform inversion techniques on the stacked
              images, and to search for  anomalous or unexplained features in the data.  ***
