Abstract    :
                9315108  Richards  In some short-period Algol binary star systems, a stream of
               material falls from the secondary onto the primary star.  This  effect is
              observable as emission in various spectral lines.  The  investigator will
              continue investigating this effect using profiles  of the H-alpha line obtained
              at the National Solar Observatory.   The observations indicate the existence of
              a rapidly rotating  component, a high temperature accretion region, a high
              density  region between the stars and an accretion disk around the primary.
