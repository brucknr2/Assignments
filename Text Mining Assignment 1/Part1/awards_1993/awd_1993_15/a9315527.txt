Abstract    :
              9315527  Crawford  This project supports the participation of Dr.  Tadesse
              Mesfin of Addis Ababa University,  Ethiopia, in an ongoing study in plant 
              molecular phylogenetics, led by Dr. Daniel  Crawford of Ohio State University,
              (NSF Grant  INT-9025030), of the systematics and evolution  of the genus
              Coreopsis (Asteraceae).  Both  South America and Eastern Africa represent 
              centers of diversity for Coreopsis that equal  or surpass that found in North
              America.  This  collaborative component will expand the work  beyond North and
              South American taxa to  investigate the relationship of North American 
              Coreopsis to African plants that have been  variously assigned to Bidens or
              Coreopsis.    It is hoped that the visiting scientist can  obtain morphological
              characters useful in a  cladistic analysis of Coreopsis and selected 
              representatives of the large genus Bidens and  several related genera.  The
              visitor will  examine the holdings in several herbaria in the  U.S., and will
              be introduced to some basic  molecular techniques being used in the host 
              scientist's laboratory to apply to the problem.   These include allozymes,
              restriction site  analysis of chloroplast DNA, and RAPDs.  The  cooperation
              will improve understanding of  Coreopsis in each of the geographical areas 
              where it occurs, and also on a worldwide basis,  including its origin,
              evolution and  biogeography.  Improved understanding of this  large, widespread
              genus is consistent with the  Africa Initiative emphasis on biodiversity 
              research cooperation, and promises benefits to  both partners and to their
              parent institutions.   Moreover, this project will contribute to the 
              establishment of a longterm research network  linking scientists on three
              continents, Africa,  North America, and South America.  ***
