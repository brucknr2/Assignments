Abstract    :
              9315085  Lyle    This award will support a marine geological and geophysical
              study  of the California Current system and is a cooperative project  between
              scientists at Boise State University and the University of  Southern
              California. The main objectives of the project are to  acquire an extensive
              base of seismic reflection data and a suite of  large diameter piston cores and
              to use this new data to examine  changes in the current system over the last
              glacial cycle. the  results of the study will be correlated with similar work
              on land.  Additionally, the data to be acquired will be used in planning 
              drilling as part of the Ocean Drilling Program which will examine  the
              long-term evolution of the California Current in response to  changing Neogene
              climate conditions. The investigators on this  study are highly qualified and
              the project will take advantage of  close cooperation with a number of other
              groups engaged in studies  of the California Current.  ***
