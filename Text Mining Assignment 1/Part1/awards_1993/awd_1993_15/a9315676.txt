Abstract    :
              9315676  Spontak    The resolution of a conventional optical microscope, limited
              by  diffraction in the "far-field," is dictated by the wavelength of  the
              electromagnetic radiation employed.  Recent studies have  successfully
              demonstrated that a microscope based on a drawn  optical fiber and operated
              within very close proximity to a  specimen (in the "near-field") is limited by
              the size of the probe  (to ca. 20 nm) and not by considerations.  In this work,
              we will  carry out an exploratory program in which polarization near-field 
              scanning optical microscopy (PNSOM) is developed and applied as a  novel
              characterization technique to determine the spatial  distribution of local
              molecular organization (through  birefringence) in a variety of ordered
              polymeric materials.   Several systems will be targeted for initial studies in
              this  program.  Local birefringence in a liquid crystal/polymer emulsion  (for
              electro-optical applications) would provide information  regarding molecular
              organization at the crystal/polymer interface.   In-situ studies of
              thermotropic and lyotropic polymers will permit  determination of local
              supramolecular organization preceding  mesophase formation and reorganization
              accompanying thermal  treatment.    While these systems will be the focus of
              our initial studies, we  foresee PNSOM as a high-resolution imaging technique
              promising to  prove beneficial in studies involving crystallization, surface 
              orientation, localized stress, and phase compatibilization.  This  technique is
              non-destructive and does not require the capital,  maintenance, and high-vacuum
              needed by several high-resolution  imaging techniques.  ***
