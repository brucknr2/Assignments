Abstract    :
              9315029  Smith  The annual expansion and retreat of pack ice in the Southern 
              Ocean are the largest seasonal processes in the World Ocean. This  seasonal
              migration of the ice cover has a profound impact on the  pelagic community in
              the upper 100 m of the oceanic water column  where the interactions between ice
              cover and apex predators, such  as seabirds and mammals, are most intense. 
              This unique pelagic  community has been mainly studied with ship-based
              operations.  However, there are well recognized problems associated with 
              shipboard sampling of the epipelagic community under pack ice and  the need to
              monitor this community on long-time scales sufficient  to examine the extreme
              temporal variability of this environment.   To examine continuous temporal
              variability, the project will  develop a vertically-profiling pump sampler for
              the collections  of zooplankton and micronekton over programmable depth
              intervals  under pack ice in the Weddell Sea.  Once developed and field 
              tested, this instrument will be deployed concurrently with  previously
              developed upward-looking, vertically-profiling  acoustic arrays for a period of
              one year. The combined mooring  project will monitor the vertical distribution,
              abundance and  size frequency of acoustically detectable zooplankton and 
              micronekton in the upper 100 m of the water column in an area  that experiences
              ice cover during 7-8 months of the year.  This  project will also include
              seasonal shipboard sampling on three  cruises over the course of the one year
              field study.  A  successful deployment of these long-term mooring arrays and 
              retrieval of data from the field will contribute to a greater  understanding of
              how epipelagic communities function under pack  ice in the Southern Ocean. 
              This is a jointly sponsored project  of the Office of Polar Programs and the
              Division of Ocean  Sciences.  ***
