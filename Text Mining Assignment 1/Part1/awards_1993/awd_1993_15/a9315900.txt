Abstract    :
              9315900  Walker  This is a project to examine, in detail, the Re-Os  systematics
              of two suites of ultramafic rocks, the ca. 2.0  Ga Pechenga ferropicrites and
              the ca. 150 Ma Gorgona Island  komatiites.  Both whole rocks and mineral
              separates will be  analyzed from each location.  The resulting information 
              should lead to: 1) a better  understanding of where Re and  Os are sited in
              these types of rocks and what phases or  combination of phases provide useful
              information about  initial isotopic compositions, and  2) a characterization of
               the long-term Re-Os histories of the mantle reservoirs from  which the rocks
              were derived.  The Pechenga ferropicrites  are associated with extensive Ni
              mineralization.  The Re-Os  systematics of these ores will also be utilized as
              a tracer  for determining the sources of noble metals contained in the  ores
              and how they were affected by subsequent metamorphism.
