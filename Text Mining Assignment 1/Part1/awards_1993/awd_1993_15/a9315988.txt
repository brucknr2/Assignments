Abstract    :
              9315988  Van der Voo       Major curves or bends in orogenic belts occur in most
              orogens,  however their origin is complex and not well understood.  
              Paleomagentic data, for example, indicate that some rotations  appear to
              pre-date the development of major folds and thrusts,  while others clearly
              post-date the folds.  This study will combine  paleomagnetic and magnetic
              fabric study of three representative  oroclines to help define the temporal
              relations between folding,  remagnetization, rotation and strain.  Results
              should provide  important kinematic constraints on the evolution of curved fold
              and  thrust belts.
