Abstract    :
              9315340  Gates    The objectives of this effort are to prepare uniform supported
               metal clusters (close to molecular size), characterize their  structures, and
              test them as catalysts.  Iridium and platinum  clusters of systematically
              varied sizes on metal-oxide (magnesia or  alumina) supports are made from
              polynuclear organometallic  precursors on the supports; the carbonyl-cluster
              precursors are  treated under conditions that yield, as nearly as possible, 
              decarbonylated metal clusters with the same numbers of metal atoms  and the
              same metal framework structures as the precursors.  The  structures of the
              decarbonylated clusters, such as tetrairidium or  hexairidium, are determined
              using extended X-ray absorption fine  structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, hydrogen
              chemisorption, electron  microscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), and
              atomic force  microscopy (AFM).  The samples are tested as catalysts for 
              hydrogenation of cyclohexene, hydrogenation of benzene,  hydrogenolysis of
              n-butane, and dehydrocyclization of   n-hexane.  Relationships between
              catalytic properties and cluster  structures are attempted.    Very small (less
              than a nanometer) particles (clusters) of metal on  supports offer high
              reproducibility and very efficient use of  expensive precious metals; they may
              also provide unique catalytic  properties.  This is a continuation of the
              seminal and pioneering  effort in this area and offers the promise of improved
              performance  and higher efficiency in a variety of chemical, petrochemical, and
               fuel refining operations.         ***
