Abstract    :
              9315117  Mischaikow    This awards supports a two-year cooperative  research
              project between Professor Konstantin  Mischaikow, Center for Dynamical Systems
              and  Nonlinear Studies, Georgia Institute of  Technology, and Professor
              Yasumasa Nishiura,  Department of Mathematics, Hiroshima  University,
              Hiroshima, Japan.  The objective of  the project is to develop theoretical 
              techniques for use in dynamical systems by  integrating analytical and
              topological methods,  and then to apply them to several problems  arising from
              systems of reaction diffusion  equations.  Two other Japanese researchers -- 
              Hiroshi Kokubu of Kyoto University and Hiroe  Oka of Ryukoku University -- will
              also  participate in the project.    During his visits to Japan, Professor 
              Mischaikow will attempt to combine two  viewpoints of dynamics and bifurcation
              theory:   an algebraic-topologic approach, based  primarily on the Conley
              index, which is his  expertise, and an analytic approach based on  singular
              perturbation theory represented by the  three Japanese researchers.  The
              long-range  goal of the project is to use the information  to understand the
              appearance of complicated,  possibly chaotic, dynamics in specified  dynamical
              systems generated by partial  differential equations.  Some prototype models, 
              new approaches, and preliminary results have  already been achieved through
              prior  collaboration of the U.S. and Japanese research  groups.  ***
