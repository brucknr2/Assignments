Abstract    :
              9315926  Hodges       This award provides funding for one-half the cost of
              upgrade  modifications to the noble gas mass spectrometry laboratory in the 
              Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at the  Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology. MIT is committed to  providing the remaining funds
              needed for the upgrade to the  laboratory.       The modifications include
              augmentation of automation to permit  unattended laser mapping and
              pre-programmed incremental heating  studies of samples, a new gas purification
              line for the laser  sampling source, and improvements in data reduction and
              data  archiving capabilities. The MIT noble gas mass spectrometer is used  to
              obtain argon/argon dates of geological samples.  ***
