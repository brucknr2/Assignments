Abstract    :
              CTS-9315591  Columbia University  Alan C. West          ABSTRACT      Spatial
              and temporal variation of electrodeposition for two specific cathode geometries
              in the presence of laminar, tangential, periodic flow will be investigated. 
              Current distributions are to be determined for a cathode at the base of a
              recessed insulating cavity and for a set of three closely spaced cathodes. 
              Experimental measurements of the codeposition of copper with trace amounts of
              silver will be compared to results from numerical simulations with the
              transport equations.    Improved electrodeposition has the potential for higher
              quality products in a broad range of industries from plating to
              microelectronics.
