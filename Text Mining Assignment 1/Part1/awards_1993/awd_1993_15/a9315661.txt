Abstract    :
                      9315661  Ricles  The Structural Stability Research Council (SSRC) will
              conduct its  50th anniversary technical program in 1994.  The emphasis of the 
              program will be on the state-of-the-art and future developments of  the major
              stability topics.  A vision of stability design practice  ten to twenty years
              in the future is required to establish research  goals and to consider how
              research results and new technology can  be implemented in design practice. 
              With this in mind, the theme of  the entire conference is "SSRC-LINK BETWEEN
              RESEARCH PRACTICE."
