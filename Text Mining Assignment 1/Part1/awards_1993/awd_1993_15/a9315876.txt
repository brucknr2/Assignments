Abstract    :
              9315876  Balantekin      This award will support the airfare and lodging
              expenses for  Dr. A. B. Balantekin, of the University of Wisconsin Department 
              of Physics, to enable him to make one visit each year over the  next three
              years, to conduct cooperative research with   Dr. Serdar Kuyucak of the
              Department of Theoretical Physics at   the Australian National University
              (ANU). The proposed  collaborative research is in the area of theoretical
              nuclear  physics with an emphasis on fusion reactions involving heavy ions  at
              energies below the Coulomb barrier.    Balantekin and his collaborators have
              developed a model for  subbarrier fusion which incorporates the interacting
              boson model  to describe the structure of target nuclei. Kuyucak at ANU, along 
              with investigators from the University of Melbourne, developed an 
              approximation scheme to study proton scattering. In November 1992  the
              Australian Department of Industry, Technology and Regional  Development
              (DITARD), under the U.S. - Australia Cooperative  Science Program, provided
              support for Dr. Kuyucak to come to the  U.S. to begin work on bringing together
              the expertise of the  respective groups. This award will enable the
              continuation of  this newly established collaboration.
