Abstract    :
                9315375  Wasserman  Research on the physics of compact stars will be continued
              by a  team of researchers with many years of experience in this field.   Topics
              to be addressed include a Bayesian analysis of   ray burst  statistics, the
              production of cyclotron lines from relativistic  flows, baryonic matter in the
              galactic halo, x-ray emission from  slowly accreting neutron stars, explosions
              of neutron stars near  minimum mass and the formation of brown low mass dwarfs
              by slow  accretion.     ***
