Abstract    :
              9315738  Doyle  This project is on research to  extract modeling and control 
              strategies from biological control  systems.  The specific biological  system
              chosen for this study is the  baroreceptor vagal reflex, which is  responsible
              for the regulation of  blood pressure. The mechanisms of  this system have both
              a practical  engineering interest and a medical  interest.  The more immediate
              goal  of this research is to develop  synthesis tools for engineering  systems
              modeling and control.  The  longer term goal is to develop new  understanding
              of biological control  systems to enable advancement of  therapeutic techniques
              for  correcting malfunctioning control  mechanisms.  ***
