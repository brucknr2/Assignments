Abstract    :
                9315578  Bodenheimer    The PI will continue his studies of the role of disks
              in the  formation of stars and planetary systems.  With this grant, the PI 
              will investigate whether convection plays an important role in the  long
              standing problem of viscosity in disks surrounding stars and  will study the
              effect of density waves induced in a protostellar  disk by the tides from a
              companion star.  The generation, structure  and evolution of a disk surrounding
              a protoplanetary core will be  explored.  ***
