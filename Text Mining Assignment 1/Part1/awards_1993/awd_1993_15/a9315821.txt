Abstract    :
              9315821  MOPPER      Light-initiated reactions play important roles in chemical
              and  biological processes in the sea, including redox reactions, carbon 
              cycling and photoinhibition.  Despite the importance of  photochemical
              processes, almost nothing is known about  photochemical pathways and reaction
              sites within marine DOM that  are responsible for production of reactive sites
              within Marine DOM  that are responsible for production of reactive transients
              at the  sea surface.  The focus will be shifted from oceanic carbon cycling  to
              the study of precursors and mechanisms involved in the  photochemical formation
              of LMW carbonyl compounds and OH radicals  form marine DOM and DOM isolates,
              e.g., humic substances.  Some of  the key questions are: Are LMW carbonyl
              compounds and OH radicals  formed mainly by primary or by secondary
              photoprocesses? What is  the role of oxidants, e.g., O2, superoxide peroxides,
              in the  photoproduction of these species in seawater?  Is photobleaching of 
              DOM fluorescence (and absorbance) in seawater accompanied by an  actual loss of
              humic substances or only of chromophoric moieties?  Can the marine DOM pool be
              physically fractionated into  photoreactive (humic) and photo-unreactive
              fractions? What is the  nature of the chromophoric sites within marine DOM?
              This study will  provide new basic information on the photochemical, chemical,
              and  spectroscopic properties of marine DOM.
