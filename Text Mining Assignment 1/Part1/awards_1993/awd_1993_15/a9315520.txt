              education institutions to  the Internet over 56 kbps lines.  They are:        
              Clovis Community College           Clovis       New Mexico Junior College      
                 Hobbs       New Mexico Military Institute      Roswell       Eastern New
              Mexico University      Roswell       Ruidoso Instructional Center       Ruidoso
                 Eastern New Mexico University at Portales has an existing  connection to the
              NSFNET, and is serving as coordinator for the  connection project.  Faculty and
              students at the new sites will  benefit from access to the resources of the
              Internet, including  libraries and supercomputers.  In addition, they will be
              able to  communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions  in
              pursuit of research and educational projects.  The award  provides partial
              support of the project for two years.
