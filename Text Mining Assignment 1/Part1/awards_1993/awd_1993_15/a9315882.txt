Abstract    :
              9315882  Iwasa    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor Yuki-Kazu  Iwasa, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and  Professor Kaoru Yamafuji,
              Department of  Electronics, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.   The project
              was begun in 1992 an involves other  U.S. investigators from the Brookhaven
              National  Laboratory, Florida State University, the  University of Illinois,
              and Iowa State  University.  Other Japanese investigators are  from Yokohama
              National University, Iwate  University, Seikei University, and Waseda 
              University.    The specific issues to be covered in this phase  of the
              collaborative effort are:  (1) improvement  in critical currents in high-Tc
              superconductors,  (2) conductor issues other than critical  currents, and (3)
              magnet issues.  The United  States and Japan are the leaders and rivals in 
              superconducting magnet technology and are the  nations most intensely engaged
              in high-Tc  superconductor research and development.  At  present, since the
              R&D effort in Japan on high-Tc  superconductivity, both in university and 
              industry, is substantially grater than it is in  the United States, it is
              likely that this  exchange program will benefit the United States  researchers.
