Abstract    :
              Landry  9315432     Most of the organic production in the oligotrophic open 
              oceans is created by or passed through bacterioplankton and  consequently made
              available for consumption by small  flagellated protozoa which feed by direct
              interception.   At  spatial scales relevant to such organisms, predator-prey 
              interactions are likely to be controlled by the balance of  molecular and
              hydrodynamic forces acting or small particles  moving relative to one another
              in a liquid media, rather  than by complex hunting or avoidance behaviors. 
              Thus, it  may be possible to understand clearance rates and selectives  of
              bacterivorous flagellates from physical and chemical  first principles.  The
              present research focuses on the  influences of bacterial motility and
              physiochemical surface  properties (hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge) on
               zooflagellate bacterivory.  In an ecological context,  increased motility and
              hydrophobicity may provide survival  advantages to bacterioplankton in
              oligotrophic environments.  However, such characteristics would also increase
              the  frequency of random contacts with predators and would be a  likely
              disadvantage in terms of mortality rate.  Dr. Landry  will use  an integrated
              descriptive, experimental, and  theoretical  approach to:  1) characterize
              size, abundance,  motility, and  surface properties of natural microbial 
              communities in  waters of Hawaii; 2) test the effects of  prey motility and 
              surface properties on feeding rates of  zoofagellates; 3)  determine the
              selective advantages of  motility and  hydrophobicity as a function of
              nutritional  environment and  zooflagellate predation; and 4) continue 
              development of a  Force-Balance model of direct contact  feeding.       ***
