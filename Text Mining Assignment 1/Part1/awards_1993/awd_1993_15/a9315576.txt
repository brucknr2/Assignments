Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   program
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Delaware acquire a
              400 MHz spectrometer which will be used in the   following research
              investigations: Structure Determination of Synthetic   Peptide Analogs of
              G-Proteins; Peptide Model for B-sheet Formation; NMR   Studies of Substrate
              Binding Sites of NAD-Dependent Isocitrate   Dehydrogenase; Peptide Models of
              Small Tertiary Structures;   Intramolecular Diene Cyclozirconation; Xe-129 NMR
              Spectroscopy  of the   Gas Sorbed in Zeolites; and Substituted Phosphonate
              Syntheses.      Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool   available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure
              of   molecules.  It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize  
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the   dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to   state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are   carrying out frontier research.
               The results from these NMR studies are   useful in areas such as polymers and
              catalysis, and in biology.
