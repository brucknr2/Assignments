Abstract    :
              9315057  Bhaduri    The ultimate objective of the proposal is to produce
              zirconia  toughened titanium diboride matrix composites by the novel 
              "Combustion Synthesis" or "High Temperature Self Propagating  Synthesis" route.
               The project seeks to achieve one step  densification by carrying out carefully
              planned experiments  incorporating transformable zirconia in elemental blends
              of  powders.  Zirconia plays two important roles; 1) control the  exothermic
              reaction, 2) impart enhanced toughness to the  brittle titanium diboride matrix
              by the process of transformation  toughening.  Thermodynamic analyses will also
              be carried out in  order to analyze the effect of the addition of zirconia.   
              %%%    The aim of the proposed research is to produce toughened titanium 
              diboride matrix composite materials to retain the beneficial  hardness
              properties of titanium diboride while reducing its  brittleness and increasing
              numerous applications such as coatings  for cutting tools will benefit from the
              research proposed.  ***
