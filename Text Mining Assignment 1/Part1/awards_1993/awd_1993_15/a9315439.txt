Abstract    :
              9315439  Sachs    This award supports a two-year cooperative  science project
              between Dr. Matthew Sachs,  Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry, 
              Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology, Oregon  Graduate Institute of Science and
              Technology,  and Professor Hirokazu Inoue, Department of  Regulation Biology,
              Saitama University, Urawa,  Japan.  The goal of the collaborative effort is  to
              obtain cDNA clones for Neurospora crassa  genes that are induced in response to
               ultraviolet light damage.  The investigators  will use sensitive differential
              hybridization  techniques to identify these clones in cDNA  libraries prepared
              from UV-induced cultures.   They will also prepare libraries using this  cDNA
              to enable expression in yeast and  bacteria, providing additional powerful 
              approaches to understand gene functions.    This collaboration will provide the
              basis for  an increased understanding by the scientists in  the U.S. and
              Japanese laboratories about the  functions of genes induced by mutagenic events
               as well as the mechanisms that control the  expression of these genes.  ***
