Abstract    :
              9315831  Woodburne  This award supports a study of terrestrial vertebrates from 
              lower Cenozoic sediments on Seymour Island in the Antarctic  Peninsula. 
              Seymour Island contains rich and well preserved  faunal and floral assemblages
              in a thick stratigraphic section  that encompasses the Cretaceous-Tertiary
              boundary.  Previous work  has yielded marsupial and placental mammal fossils. 
              The lower  Cenozoic Sobral Formation contains terrestrial sediments that are 
              likely to yield substantially more fossil material and this  material would
              represent the earliest Tertiary vertebrates known  from Antarctica.  The
              objectives of this proposal are to  understand the role of high latitude
              locations in biological  evolution and dispersal of vertebrates in the early
              Tertiary.   This work is likely to lead to a better understanding of  migration
              patterns and evolutionary relationships between  Australian and South American
              vertebrates.  ***
