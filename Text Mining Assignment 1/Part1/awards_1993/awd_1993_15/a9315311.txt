Abstract    :
              9315311  Bidigare      This project provides core measurments of algal pigments 
              (chlorophylls, carotenoids, phycoerythrin and phaeopigments) for  the Hawaii
              Ocean Time-series (HOT) Program. Analytical methods  employ QA/QC procedures to
              insure highly accurate and precise, as  well as "comparable" data.  Pigment
              data are being used to document  depth-dependent, seasonal and interannual
              variations in  phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) an composition (accessory 
              pigments) at Station ALOHA. Accessory pigments provide class-  specific
              differentiation, allowing the recognition of bomass  contributions by
              cyanobacteria (phycoerythrin); prochlorophytes  (divinyl chlorophyll a);
              prasinophytes (prasinoxanthin);  chlorophytes (lutein); prymnesiophytes (19'- 
              hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin); chrysophytes (19'-  butanoyloxyfucoxanthin);
              cryptohytes (alloxanthin); dinoflagellates  (peridinin); and diatoms
              (fucoxanthin). Relative biomass  contributions (i.e., as a percentage of total
              chlorophyll a  biomass) by these algal groups are estimated from
              HPLC-determined  pigment concentrations and accessory pigment-to-chlorophyll
              ratios  (cf. Hooks et al., 1988; Letelier et al., in revision).
