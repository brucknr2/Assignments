Abstract    :
                9315112  Dappen    Although stellar interior models have generally been in 
              satisfactory agreement with observation, the results of helio- and 
              astero-seismology are beginning to demonstrate their deficiencies.   A major
              contributor to these deficiencies is uncertainty in the  equation of state used
              in constructing the models.  Improved  calculations of the equation of state
              will be performed to remedy  this situation.  The new equation of state
              formulation will be  valid over a wide range of conditions and will be useful
              for  studies of the interiors of planets as well as stars.  ***
