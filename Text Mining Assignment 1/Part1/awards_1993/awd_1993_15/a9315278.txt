Abstract    :
              9315278  Cane    This award supports the participation of 14  U.S. scientists
              and engineers in a U.S.-Japan  Seminar on Biosynthesis of Natural Products -- 
              From Pathways to Genes to Products, scheduled  for June 1994 in Hakone, Japan. 
              The co-  organizers are Professor David Cane, Department  of Chemistry, Brown
              University, and Professor  Katsumi Kakinuma, Department of Chemistry,  Tokyo
              Institute of Technology, Japan.  In  addition to senior scientist, the seminar
              will  bring together promising junior investigators  and graduate students from
              both countries.    This is the fourth is a series of seminars on  this topic. 
              Previous seminars have had a  profound impact of the development of research 
              on biosynthesis in the two countries.  The  broadening interdisciplinary scope
              of the field  of natural product biosynthesis has made these  seminars
              increasingly important as a means of  bringing together scientists from
              different  disciplines, particularly bioorganic chemists,  enzymologists, and
              molecular biologists.   Participants have been selected from a wide  range of
              academic laboratories and research  institutes, national laboratories, and 
              pharmaceutical and biotechnology research  laboratories in both countries.  The
               interactions between senior investigators and  the next generation of
              scientists will ensure  the continued vitality of this field.  This  seminar is
              also being supported by the National  Science Foundation's Division of
              Molecular and  Cellular Biosciences and the Division of  Chemistry.  ***
