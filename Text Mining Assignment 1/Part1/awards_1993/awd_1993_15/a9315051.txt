Abstract    :
              9315051  Cherniak  This research planning grant requests support to investigate 
              silicon self-diffusion in minerals, with initial  concentration on the study of
              feldspar.  Silicon diffusion  will be measured directly with the use of a 30Si
              tracer and  Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) for depth  profiling
              of  the tracer distribution.  Results from the  experiments can be applied in
              better understanding of Al-Si  ordering, CaAl-NaSi interdiffusion, and chemical
              diffusion  involving elements of geochemical and geochronologic  interest.
