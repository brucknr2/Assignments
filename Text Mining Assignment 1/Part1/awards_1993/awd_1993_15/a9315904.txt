Abstract    :
              9315904  Garden    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will fund
              (i)  initial laboratory characterization tests of a recently developed  128 x
              128 mid-infrared (4 to 30 microns) detector array, and (ii)  the construction
              of a small test dewar/camera to permit  measurements of the array's performance
              on real astronomical  sources using the Lick 1-m telescope.  When mounted on
              the 1-m  telescope, the prototype camera is expected to achieve 2 arcsec 
              resolution images over a 16 arcmin2 field with a signal-to-noise of  10 on a 30
              mJy (7.8 mag) source in a 1 hour integration at 10  microns through a 1 micron
              bandwidth filter.  The astronomical  capabilities of the new detector array
              will be demonstrated by  using it to conduct one of the most sensitive surveys
              yet made of  the mid-infrared continuum emission from young star-forming 
              molecular clouds, such as Rho Oph and Orion.    This project is particularly
              suited to the SGER program as the  proposed work is at the forefront of
              contemporary detector array  development, yet is relatively inexpensive, and
              can be performed in  the course of only one year.  The knowledge and experience
              to be  gained during both the initial laboratory characterization and 
              subsequent observing phases of the proposed program will be of  immense value
              for the development of future mid-infrared imaging  systems for the new
              generation of very-large telescopes, such as  the recently constructed Keck and
              the soon-to-be-built Gemini  observatories.  Furthermore, a large portion of
              the requested funds  will be used to employ a graduate student who will assist
              with the  testing of the array and the development of the prototype camera.  
              Finally, if this project is funded, and we succeed in  demonstrating the power
              of the new array through observations with  the Lick 1-m telescope, we probably
              stand a good chance of being  awarded a more substantial NSF grant next year to
              build a more  sophisticated camera, based on a larger 256 x 256 mid-infrared 
              array.  ***
