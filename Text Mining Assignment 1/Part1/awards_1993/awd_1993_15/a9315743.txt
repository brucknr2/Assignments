Abstract    :
              9315743  Zahalak      This award will partially support travel costs associated
              with  the visit by Professor George Zahalak of the Department of  Mechanical
              Engineering at Washington University, St. Louis, to   conduct collaborative
              research with Dr. Peter Hunter of the   School of Engineering at the University
              of Auckland in New  Zealand. The research will focus on the modification of an 
              existing biophysically-based model of skeletal muscle for   application to 
              cardiac mechanics.    The Distribution-Moment (DM) Model will be modified in
              order to  account for the specialized mechanics of cardiac muscle. Success 
              will result in a mathematically tractable model based on  biophysical
              cross-bridge theory, and should lead to integration  with current information
              on fiber architecture resulting in a  model for cardiac function including
              features of activation,  mechanics, energetics and metabolism. Dr. Hunter's
              extensive  experience in cardiac biomechanics will complement Dr. Zahalak's 
              background in the modelling of contraction dynamics.
