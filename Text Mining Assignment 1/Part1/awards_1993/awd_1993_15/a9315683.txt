Abstract    :
              9315683  Webster  This project will elucidate the behavior of Cl in magmatic 
              systems.  The results will find application in  processes  involving exsolution
              of Cl-bearing fluids/melts, in  speciation and transport of Cl-complexed ore
              metals in  hydrothermal fluids, or in discharge of Cl to the atmosphere  from
              erupting magma.  The research program involves a series  of experiments to
              determine:  (1) the solubility of chloride  melts (NaCl-, KCl-, and
              AlCl3-bearing) in granitic melts,  (2) the distribution of chlorine between
              granite melt and  coexisting aqueous phases, and (3) the effects of P, T, and 
              melt composition on both of these objectives.   The  experiments will be
              conducted at pressures of 0.001 to 1.5  kbar and temperatures of 700o  to 1000o
              C.   Melt  compositions will include peralkaline, subaluminous, and 
              peraluminous haplogranites and  Fe-, Ca-, Li-, B-, F-, and  CO2-bearing
              granites; the experiments will be conducted with  a range of Cl concentrations.
