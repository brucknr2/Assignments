              supports a project to search for terrestrial vertebrate fossils of Middle
              Triassic to Jurassic age in the Shackleton Glacier region of the Transantarctic
              Mountains.  Several sites are known to contain Triassic vertebrates but, based
              on occurrences in the Beardmore Glacier region to the north, the Shackleton
              Glacier area is expected to yield a diverse assemblage of both Triassic and
              Jurassic mammals and reptiles (including dinosaurs).  In addition to collecting
              fossils, field studies will result in interpretations of the taphonomic and
              depositional settings at the fossil sites.  Preparation, description,
              classification, and interpretation of the material, including interpretation of
              paleoenvironmental conditions, will follow the field work.  This research will
              contribute to a better understanding of both vertebrate evolution at high
              latitudes and climatic conditions at high latitudes during Triassic and
              Jurassic time. ***   #    x   \        P    C     wX P#
