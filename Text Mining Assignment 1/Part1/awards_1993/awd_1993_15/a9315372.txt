Abstract    :
                9315372  Leggett  Low mass, very cool stars and cool white dwarf stars are
              extremely  common but are poorly understood.  With the support of this 
              Planning Grant, spectral and photometric observations of such stars  will be
              made.  These data will improve our understanding of the  physics of the
              atmospheres of these stars.  ***
