Abstract    :
              9315256  Hardin    This award will support further development of the Mosaic
              software and related activities such as workshops, documentation development,
              and internet standards activities.  Mosaic was developed by the National Center
              for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana/Champaign,
              building on the World Wide Web software kernal.  Mosaic is client/server
              software which enables dynamic browsing, retrieval, and display of multimedia
              data over the Internet using Unix, Macintosh, or PC computers, using hypertext
              to allow English documents to contain words or images as direct links to
              additional information.  Clicking on linked words or images retrieves and
              displays new files and information transparently.  Retrieved files in turn
              contain links to other databanks, creating a global web of information.  Mosaic
              has rapidly grown to be very popular; over 300,000 copies of the software have
              been distributed to date, with thousands more every month.
