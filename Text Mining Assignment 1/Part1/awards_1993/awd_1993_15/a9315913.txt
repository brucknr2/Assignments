Abstract    :
              9315913     Van der Voo    The Pis will document the mode of occurrence of the
              magnetic mineral that carry primary  magnetizations as well as the habitat of
              secondary magnetic mineral that carry remagnetizations  in a variety of rock
              types.  This is of importance for models of rock-fluid interaction, hypotheses 
              of large-scale versus local fluid flow and tectonic interpretations of
              paleomagnetic results.
