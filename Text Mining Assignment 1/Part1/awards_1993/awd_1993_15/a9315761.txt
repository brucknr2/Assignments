Abstract    :
              9315761  Moon  This award of $190,000 is for curriculum development in adding
              new  approaches in nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear controls into 
              undergraduate engineering education.  Current analysis tools taught  in
              undergraduate engineering curriculum center upon linear dynamics  and control. 
              However, mechanical and electromechanical design  based solely on linear models
              fail to analyze properly many  important physical effects that are inherently
              non-linear.   This  proposal will develop teaching, software and experimental
              modules  to introduce methods in nonlinear analysis, with specific 
              applications that include design of a flexible robot arm,  structural design
              with nonlinear materials, nonlinear control of  smart machines, and the use of
              chaos theory to avoid machine noise.
