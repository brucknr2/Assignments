Abstract    :
              9315625  Patchett       This project will measure Nd isotopes, REE and other
              trace  elements in sandstone from the miogeocline of the Canadian Rocky 
              Mountains in order to quantify the amount of continental material  supplied
              during the lifetime of the Canadian Cordillera.  Detrital  zircon data will
              also be used to determine the relative amounts of  far-traveled versus
              near-travelled detritus.  The results will give  a useful baseline for future
              provenance studies in the region.   Results will also have implications for the
              existence of a large,  340 Ma terrane in the region and the movement of
              individual  terranes within the orogen.  These findings will have broad 
              application to the study of tectonic terranes in other orogenic  belts.
