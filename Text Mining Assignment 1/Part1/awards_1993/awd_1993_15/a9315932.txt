Abstract    :
              9315932  Anderson      The Pis will investigate a unique set of high-quality
              seismic data from the TERRAscope array  that was obtained in the near-field
              (and pode) of the Landers earthquake.  They will also analyze  the effects of
              asphericity, heterogeneity, anisotropy, rotation, and non-pure source
              components  on the near-field seismograms and spectra, and will refine the
              P-wave velocity structure of the  mantle and core by waveform modelling
              techniques in order to complement published S-wave  models and travel-time
              P-wave models.  In this way, an attempt will be made to detect lateral 
              heterogeneity at the top of the core.
