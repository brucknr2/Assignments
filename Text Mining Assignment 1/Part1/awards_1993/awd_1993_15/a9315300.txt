Abstract    :
              9315300  Janes    Although some stars in our galaxy may have formed soon after
              the  origin of the universe, the galaxy itself probably coalesced only 
              gradually with the galactic disk forming several billion years  later.  Old
              open star clusters which formed early in the history of  the disk will be
              studied.  An improved understanding of the  relation between the ages,
              compositions and velocities of these  objects will be sought.  This information
              is essential to  constructing a comprehensive model for the formation and
              evolution  of the galactic disk.  ***
