Abstract    :
              9315601  Block    This award supports the participation of eleven  U.S.
              participants in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on  the Molecular and Cellular Basis of
              Circadian  Clocks, to be held in July 1994 in Honolulu,  Hawaii.  The
              co-organizers of the seminar are  Gene Block, Director of the NSF Center for 
              Biological Timing, University of Virginia, and  Kenji Hasegawa, Department of
              Physiology,  School of Medicine, Kitasato University, Japan.   In addition to
              scientists from U.S.  universities, two U.S. high school biology  teachers will
              participate in the seminar.    The research topic is timely and important 
              given the very rapid advances in this area of  biological timing.  Laboratories
              in both  countries have yielded significant new  information.  For example, the
              development of  three new model systems for the molecular study  of circadian
              timing will provide new  opportunities for the application of molecular 
              genetics to the study of biological timing.  In  addition, recent success with
              organotypic  hypothalamic brain slice in mammals and with  fully isolated
              pacemaker neurons in mollusks  will provide new and exciting opportunities for 
              the in vitro study of biological clocks.  The  seminar will be videotaped and
              will be  available through the NSF Center's videotape  program.  ***
