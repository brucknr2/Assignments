Abstract    :
              9315099  D'Hoker    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor Eric D'Hoker,  Department of Physics, University of
              California,  Los Angeles, and Professor Norisuke Sakai,  Department of Physics,
              Tokyo Institute of  Technology, Tokyo, Japan.  The objective of the  joint
              research is to investigate five projects--  four in non-critical string theory
              and one on  non-decoupling effects in four dimensional  particle theory.  The
              collaboration has been in  progress since 1988 and has produced numerous 
              publications to date.      The first four projects on non-critical strings  are
              closely related and require experience in  supergeometry, superstrings,
              topological quantum  field theory, and matrix models.  Both  investigators have
              worked on non-decoupling  effects and continue to do so.  The joint  research
              is a natural extension of the  investigators' respective studies and will 
              benefit from the fact that they have worked on  different sides of the problem.
