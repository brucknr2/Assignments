              This research project is in response to a critical need to  validate the
              mathematical models and computer codes that are  used to calculate the dynamic
              response of important  structures for those cases in which significant
              interaction  occurs between the structure and the surrounding soil: In  this
              case through the "blind" prediction of the dynamic  response of the Hualien,
              Taiwan, large-scale model nuclear  reactor power plant containment structure
              during forced  vibration tests.  (A blind prediction is one in which the 
              prediction is made without knowing in advance what the  result should be.) 
              These tests are being conducted by a  consortium of organizations, including
              the Electric Power  Research Institute (EPRI), the Nuclear Regulatory 
              Commission, and institutions from Taiwan, Japan, Korea and  France.    The
              three tasks are:    (1) Comparisons of observed data with earlier predictions 
              for the response of the containment model, prior to backfill  of the soil
              surrounding the foundation, are used to test the  computer programs employed,
              and to improve the mathematical  models for the structure and the soil.  (2)
              Blind predictions are made for the response of the  structure during forced
              vibration tests, after backfill of  the soil surrounding the foundation.  (3)
              The prediction are compared with observations (which are  to be released by
              EPRI only after the blind predictions have  been properly recorded) for an
              overall assessment of the  current capability to model the dynamic response of 
              structures partially embedded in medium strength soils and  subjected to
              external forces.    Funding for this project is a collaboration between the 
              Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the National Science  Foundation.  ***
