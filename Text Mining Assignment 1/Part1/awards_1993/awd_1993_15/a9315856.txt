Abstract    :
              9315856  Goldfinger  This award will fund a project to investigate a fundamental
               problem in neuroscience: information propagation in branched  axons. 
              Anatomical and physiological data suggest that  axonal arborizations are
              efficient regions for neuronal  signal propagation; however, theoretical
              studies have found  that low safety factors for impulse conduction occur in 
              these regions.  This study will reexamine the theoretical  studies and use a
              new approach to solve the impulse  propagation problem.    This proposal was
              submitted to the Biosystems Analysis and  Control Initiative which encouraged
              the submission of  proposals that through the study of neurophysiological 
              systems could advance engineering science and advance the  knowledge of
              biological systems through the use of  engineering analysis techniques.  The
              research being funded  by this award has the potential to further the
              understanding  of a basic  neurophysiological phenomena and advance the  field
              of engineering in the area of computational methods.  ***
