Abstract    :
                    9315646  Lester         This grant will provide a two-year program to
              develop and  apply a new method for measuring kinematics of galactic nuclei.  
              This information will lead to robust mass estimates, and allow  critical
              investigation of the star forming history of heavily  obscured nuclear regions.
               It will also provide insight into the  dynamics of collisions and mergers and
              their role in starbursts.   Newly available instrumentation at the Infrared
              Telescope Facility  in Hawaii allows a large number of interesting galactic
              nuclei to  be observed.  Since the Kinematics of stars, instead of gas, is 
              measured, the derived gravitational potential is insensitive to  dissipative
              forces and large scale flows.  The long wavelength  minimizes extinction in
              heavily obscured regions, yet is short  enough that the continuum is relatively
              undiluted by thermal  emission. A new instrument, now under development at the
              McDonald  Observatory of the University of Texas, will provide complimentary 
              measurements of the most massive, compact nuclei with large  velocity
              dispersions.
