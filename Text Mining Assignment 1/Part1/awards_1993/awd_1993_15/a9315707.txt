Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Toreki's                      
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry. The research                    
              will deal with the synthesis of rigid polymeric solid-state                    
              organometallic and inorganic frameworks.  Specifically,                        
              functionalized tetraarylsilanes will be reacted with various                   
              metal complexes to form three-dimensional polymeric networks                   
              containing alternating metal- and silicon-centered units. A                    
              specific example of such a polymer will be the product formed                  
              by the reaction of four equivalents of iron pentacarbonyl with                 
              a phosphine-substituted tetraarylsilane. Morphological control                 
              of cavity, pore and channel formation will be achieved by the                  
              selection of metal complexes and the nature of the linking                     
              functionalities.  It is expected that these materials will                     
              afford efficient heterogeneous catalysts for processes such as                 
              hydrogenation and hydroformylation.

              The inherent rational design of these supramolecular                           
              architectures permits the facile tailoring of their specific                   
              properties, pore dimensions and topologies and defines a                       
              fundamental new class of innovative materials.
