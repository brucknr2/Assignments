Abstract    :
              9315757  Quinn       A Conference on Prospects in Topology will be held at 
              Princeton University on March 16-19, 1994.  Sixteen hour-talks  are scheduled
              from important figures in the field from the U.S.  and Europe.  The focus will
              be on new problems and techniques in  topology arising in recent applications. 
              The objective is to  foster communication between those applying topology and
              those  involved in internal development, to avoid fragmentation and  isolation
              of parts of the subject.  Graduate students will be  involved, and an attempt
              will be made to publish the  ideas presented at a level accessible to general
              mathematical  audiences.  ***
