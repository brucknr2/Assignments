Abstract    :
              9315320  Kuperstein  This award partially supports a workshop on
              self-determination in  developing and evolving systems.  The workshop will take
              place in  Boston, MA, January 6-9, 1994, and is being co-supported by AFOSR 
              and ONR.  Living systems at different scales appear to share  similar
              principles of adaptation and growth towards self-  determination. 
              Self-determination in these systems is their  ability to create new and
              increasingly more complex interactions  with their environment and other
              systems.  There are two goals of  this workshop:  First, consolidate principles
              and mechanisms of  self-determination that cut across scales which range from 
              biological to neural to psychological to social systems; second,  discuss the
              applications of these principles to understanding  natural systems and creating
              innovative computing systems.  ***
