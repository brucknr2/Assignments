Abstract    :
              9315691  Robinson    Technical abstract:  The kinetics of '2+lD' growth relates
              to the  evolution of the external shape of a surface.  A universal behavior  of
              this kinetics has been predicted by a recent theory due to  Kardar, Parisi and
              Zhang.  It is proposed to capitalize on the  recent advances in surface x-ray
              diffraction using synchrotron  radiation which now permit the exploration of
              surfaces and  interfaces in the time domain.  The primary aim is to seek out 
              model systems which provide a test of the universal behavior and to  understand
              the underlying physics.  The kinetics of a simple  monolayer on a metal
              substrate will be studied using the Pb/Cu(100)  system.  The Pd2Si/Si (lll)
              system will be used to study the  complex interface formed by the reaction
              between metals and silicon  in the formation of thin films of crystalline
              silicides.    Non-technical abstract:  This proposal supports an experimental 
              program that will be based at the National Synchrotron Light Source  in
              Brookhaven, N.Y.  The beamline to be used was designed for  state-of-the-art
              diffraction experiments on surfaces.  The proposed  experiments are aimed at
              understanding the details of how a surface  grows on an atomic scale and on a
              time scale of 0.00l seconds.  In  addition, the work will have direct
              application to understanding  the formation of thin films of crystalline
              silicides.  Such  materials are increasingly important for semiconductor 
              interconnects, especially for electronic devices with ultrasmall  dimensions.
