Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Jon Marks, Ken Kidd, Amos Dienard   SBR-9315871    Recent
              advances in the field of molecular genetics are being used to investigate the
              evolutionary  relationships between humans and apes and other primates. 
              However, most such phylogenetic analyses have used single individuals of ape
              species to represent the entire species, and the resulting phyolgenies, given
              the genetic closeness of the different species, could be seriously distorted by
              specific variation within any of the species involved.  Genetic variation
              within species is more extensive than formerly imagined, and is the focus of
              much developing work in this area.    This dissertation research will directly
              address the question of both population variation and phylogeny by a direct
              analysis of variation at five selected genes in the nuclear genome.  It will
              yield us a very good idea of the extent of genetic variation within and among
              chimpanzee species, and offer a comparison with the variation in humans (there
              are some indicaitons that more variety exists among a single chimp species of
              small numbers and occupying a small area than among all humans - if true, a
              remarkable finding on the homogeneity of humans).    Also, the work will
              provide a useful base from which to plan future breeding of  captive  
              colonies.  ***  P\anthro\jfried\9315871.abs
