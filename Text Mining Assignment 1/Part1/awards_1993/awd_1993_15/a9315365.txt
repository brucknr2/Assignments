Abstract    :
              9315365  Guinan    There are several special classes of eclipsing binary stars
              whose orbital and  physical properties are well suited for them to serve as
              astrophysical  laboratories, both for the study of the stars themselves and the
              galaxies in  which they reside.  The aim of this project is to provide
              essential information  from binary star systems concerning: the internal
              structure of the component  stars, the helium abundance, the effect of
              overshooting in the convective  cores, the General Relativistic component to
              apsidial motion, and the  properties of stars and the distance moduli to the
              Large and the Small  Magellanic Clouds.  This award is made under the auspices
              of the Research  in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program at the NSF.
