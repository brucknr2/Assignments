Abstract    :
              9315689 Wolfe This award will provide partial support for a symposium entitled 
              Modeling and Control in Biomedical Systems.   The meeting is under the auspices
              of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC).  The symposium
              will focus on the utilization of systems and control principles and techniques
              in the interdisciplinary area involving engineering, biology, life science and
              medicine.  The meeting will bring together international experts in discussions
              of the application of system and control principles to significant biomedical
              problems under three themes: 1-modeling and control concepts from the
              molecular/cellular to the organ system level; 2-modeling techniques ranging
              from conventional to current and sometimes controversial concepts; and
              3-discussions on the integration of engineering and biological concepts. 
              Proceedings of the symposium are to be published, thereby making results of the
              meeting available to a large audience. ***
