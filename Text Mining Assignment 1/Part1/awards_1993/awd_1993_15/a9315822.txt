              Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant proposal will seek to develop a
              research project to determine the extent technology such as PCs is used to help
              introduce, reinforce, practice or facilitate the learning of school topics?  In
              addition, this study will seek to determine the extent technology is used for
              entertainment purposes versus supporting extracurricular activities such as
              musical training programs. There is a dearth of information regarding the
              affect technology has on early childhood development.  Demographics are
              available which show a positive correlation between income, ownership of a home
              personal computer (PC), and the eduction of parents, among other traits, and
              children's school performance.  Yet, very little is known regarding how home
              technology such as PCs or video cassette recorders (VCR) or even television
              (TV) is used to promote learning.  This study seeks to explore the present
              usage of technology in American homes with children.
