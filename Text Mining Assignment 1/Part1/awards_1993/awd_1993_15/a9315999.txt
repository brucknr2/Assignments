Abstract    :
              9315999  Fu  This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Fu's  Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships in Chemistry award. The focus  of the research deals with
              the use of indenyl-metal complexes  to direct catalytic processes.
              Specifically, ring slippage of  the metal-bound indenyl ligand will be
              exploited to open up  coordination sites on metal systems to provide the
              necessary  coordinatively-unsaturated reactive intermediates for  catalysis. An
              important feature of this mechanism is enhanced  stereocontrol of the reaction
              due to the high level of  organization in the transition state. Initial studies
              will  explore indenylrhodium complexes in catalytic olefin  hydrogenation,
              hydroboration and hydroformylation.  %%%  This research on directed catalytic
              reactions will provide  fundamental insights into reactivity as well as new
              methods for  synthetic organic chemistry.  ***
