Abstract    :
              9315118  Ebtisam S. Wilkins  The purpose of this project is to develop an
              implantable  glucose sensor for continuous in vivo monitoring of glucose 
              concentration in blood or in other body fluids, and without  the need for
              withdrawal of body fluids.  This should lead  both to a marked improvement in
              the clinical management and  scientific understanding of diabetes.    The broad
              objective of this project is to test in animals an  implantable glucose sensor
              capable of continuously  monitoring blood glucose levels.  Specific aims of the
               research include the determination of sensor lifetime in  vivo, the sensor
              response time, the characterization of the  sensor behavior, and the
              biocompatibility of the sensor and  attendant telemetry system in the body
              fluid environment.  Finally, the sensor would be miniaturized and modified as 
              indicated for a final design to be used in human trials.  ***
