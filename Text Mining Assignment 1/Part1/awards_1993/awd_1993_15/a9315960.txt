Abstract    :
              9315960  Gill  The PIs propose an integrated four year study of:  (1) the 
              partition coefficients of  Th, U, and Ra; (2) numerical  models of the behavior
              of radionuclides during partial  melting; and (3)  Th, U, Ra, and Pa activities
              in volcanic  rocks from mid-ocean ridge segments (Siqueros transform,  36oN and
              33oS on the Mid Atlantic Ridge, and a propogating  tip of the Galapagos
              Spreading Center at 86oW), two  continental margin arcs (Japan and Kamchatka)
              and two  oceanic arc-backarcs (tholeiites in central Izu and  shoshonites in
              the northern Marianas), and two chemically-  zoned continental felsic systems
              (Inyo-Mono in California  and Baitoushan in China).  The objective is to
              distinguish  the effect of time from the effect of an open system in each 
              case.  The key to reaching this objective, apart from  overcoming the difficult
              analytical problems, is choosing  rock suites well-suited to thematic questions
              and for which  abundant other geological and geochemical information will  be
              available.  Consequently, this proposal focuses on #3  above.
