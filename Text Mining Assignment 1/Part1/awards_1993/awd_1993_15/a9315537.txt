Abstract    :
              9315537  Morari  This award of $200,000 is for curriculum development in control
               systems.  Traditional introductory undergraduate courses in control  theory do
              not capture the recent developments in research and still  tend to be a
              collection of tricks without a coherent theme.   Moreover, control theory has
              become very interdisciplinary and now  has no natural home within the
              traditional engineering disciplines.   Yet because of the increasingly
              important role that the design of  control into engineered devices and
              processes that modern advances  in computers and communications is making
              possible, it is now very  important to introduce modern control theory and
              techniques to  undergraduates.  This proposal will develop modular curricula
              for  two control courses at the senior level, involving both theory and 
              experimentation.  Two experiments that can be run remotely will be  developed
              for the courses, control in buildings and control of a  ducted fan engine.
