Abstract    :
              9315986  Hart  This project is to carry out osmium isotope studies of  laurites
              from a number of well-characterized chromitites in  an attempt to constrain the
              arguments regarding the source  and accumulation processes of PGMs in the
              Bushveld Complex.  The PI will look for systematic changes in 187/186 Os with 
              stratigraphic level of the chromitites, he will evaluate  along-strike changes
              in both the Merensky and UG-2  chromitites, and will investigate the variations
              in 187/186  Os in both the UG-2 and LG-6 chromitites in relation to  defined
              hydrothermal alteration features.  Currently more  than 60 samples are in hand,
              with identified and marked  laurites; these are derived from the active,
              on-going  research projects of several South African collaborators.
