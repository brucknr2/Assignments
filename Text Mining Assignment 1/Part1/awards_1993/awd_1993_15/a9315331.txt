Abstract    :
              9315331  Flemings    This awards supports the participation of seven  U.S.
              scientists and engineers in a U.s.-Japan  Seminar on Solidification Processing
              for the 21st  Century, scheduled for July 1994 in Lenox, MA.   The seminar is
              co-organized by Professor Merton  Flemings, Department of Materials Science and
               Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, and Professor Itsuo
              Ohnaka,  Department of Materials Science and Processing,  Osaka University. 
              This is the fourth in a series  of U.S.-Japan seminars that have been held 
              approximately every five years since 1977.      Discussions at the seminar will
              range from  solidification fundamentals to industrial  practice.  Fundamentals
              will include heat flow,  mass flow, interface kinetics, nucleation and  growth,
              morphological development, and  fundamentals of structure-property relations.  
              These relate in part to advanced materials  including superconducting oxides,
              fiber  reinforced metals, and intermetallic compounds.   Process design and
              innovations, and process  scale-up for environmentally sound, competitive 
              manufacturing will be a central topic.  Recent  and developing processes
              including strip casting,  electro-magnetic casting, counter-gravity  casting,
              and spray forming will be discussed.   This meeting is the fourth in a series
              of U.S.-  Japan meetings in this field that have been held  approximately every
              five years since 1977.   Because of recent strong advances in both the  United
              States and Japan, it is timely to hold  another seminar in this field, which is
              of  critical importance to national competitiveness.  ***
