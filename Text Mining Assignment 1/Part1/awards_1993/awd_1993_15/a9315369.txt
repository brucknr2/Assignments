Abstract    :
              9315369  Terasawa    This award supports the participation of 13  U.S.
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on  Cellular and Molecular Action of Steroid
               Hormones in the Brain, to be held in April 1994  in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The
              co-organizers of the  seminar are Professor Ei Terasawa, Wisconsin  Regional
              Primate Research Center, University of  Wisconsin-Madison, and Professor
              Seiichiro  Kawashima, Institute of Zoology, University of  Tokyo.  In addition
              to the scientists from the  United States and Japan, there will also be 
              participants from Canada and France.    The research topic is very important
              and  timely.  The focus of the meeting is on recent  progress in understanding
              the mechanism of  action of gonadal steroids.  Gonadal steroids  influence
              neuronal cell differentiation,  migration, and survival during the prenatal and
               perinatal period and therefore affect various  brain functions, including
              cognitive function  in later life.  Gonadal steroids are also  essential for
              maintenance of reproductive  function and reproductive behavior.  The  seminar
              participants represent a broad range of  expertise using a number of model
              systems and  approaches.  There has been no recent meeting  that addresses this
              issue in  neuroendocrinology.  Thus, the seminar brings  together a diverse set
              of outstanding  researchers to present an update on an exciting  and important
              area in neuroscience.  ***
