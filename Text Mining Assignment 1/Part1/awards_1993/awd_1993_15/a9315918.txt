Abstract    :
              9315918  Zhang  This project proposes to explore further the potential of 
              applying homogenous reaction kinetics to geospeedometry.  The kinetics of
              different homogeneous reactions for various  thermal histories will be examined
              systematically and  quantitatively with theoretical analysis and numerical 
              simulations.  The effect of parameters such as activation  energies of forward
              and backward reactions, pre-exponential  factors, cooling rates, and diffusion
              on the kinetics of  different reactions during cooling will be quantitatively 
              evaluated.  The kinetics of the interconversion of hydrous  species in
              rhyolitic glasses will be characterized  experimentally.   The variation of
              speciation with time will  be used to extract reaction rate coefficients  and
              reaction  mechanisms, which will enable scientists to constrain the  thermal
              history of volcanic glasses and understand more  completely volcanic processes.
