Abstract    :
              9315747  Ricker    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor George  Ricker, Center for Space Research,  Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology, and Dr.  Masaru Matsuoka, Cosmic Radiation Laboratory,
               Institute of Physical and Chemical Research  (RIKEN), Saitama, Japan.  The
              joint research  project focuses on scientific preparations for  the High Energy
              Transient Experiment (HETE), a  dedicated, international, multiwavelength 
              astrophysics satellite scheduled for launch in  December 1994.  In the United
              States, HETE is  supported by NASA.  The partner nations are  France, Italy,
              and Japan.      This award supports the non-hardware tasks  associated with the
              experiment, which will be  carried out with scientists at established  optical
              and radio facilities throughout Japan,  as well as with scientists at RIKEN
              working on  satellite data analysis.  In the pre-launch  period, discussions
              and collaborative planning  will take place with theoretical  astrophysicists
              at various universities.  In  the post-launch period, discussions will be  held
              with Japanese astronomers interested in  transient sources.  Joint data
              analyses and  joint papers will also be prepared.  In  addition to the
              principal investigator, two  postdoctoral research associates from MIT will 
              spend time in Japan conducting data analysis.  ***
