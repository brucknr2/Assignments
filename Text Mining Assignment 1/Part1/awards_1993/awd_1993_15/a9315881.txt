Abstract    :
              9315881  Hankin      This award will provide partial support for the travel of  
              Dr. David Hankin from the Department of Fisheries at Humboldt  State University
              to spend five months at the National Institute  of Water and Atmospheric
              Research in Christchurch, New Zealand  conducting collaborative research with
              Dr. Robert McDowall and  Martin John Unwin on reproduction in chinook salmon
              populations.    In 1904, chinook salmon eggs from the upper Sacramento River in
               California were shipped to New Zealand where reproducing  populations
              successfully became established throughout   New Zealand's South Island, all
              traceable to this single egg  shipment.  No other attempts to produce
              self-sustaining   transplanted populations of these fish have proved successful
               elsewhere in the world. The study will focus on variation in  reproductive
              attributes of chinook salmon which are central to  the fitness of the
              population. This collaborative research brings  together the American and New
              Zealand experts concerned with the  reproductive traits of chinook salmon.
