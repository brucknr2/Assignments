Abstract    :
              9315508  Lawley  The goal of this project is to convert the research conducted
              over  the past two decades by the participating faculty into two junior  level
              courses aimed at students majoring in materials.  The  specific topics to be
              included in these courses are:  Clean Metals  Technology, Gas Injection
              Processes, Melt Atomization, Spray  Coating and Powder Processing.  About 10 to
              15% of the courses will  be taught by industrial partners who will bring into
              the classroom  the practice of the identified technologies.  The lecture
              materials  will be published and disseminated to other schools and 
              institutions.
