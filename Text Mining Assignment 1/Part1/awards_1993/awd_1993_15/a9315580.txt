Abstract    :
              9315580  Flynn  This Planning Grant award will enable the investigators to 
              perform a feasibility study to determine if an alternate  technology could be
              developed to replace the medical  radiograph film system.  Current-regulated
              field emission  arrays used in conjunction with thin phosphors will be 
              evaluated to determine if an electronic display for digital  radiographic data
              with image quality essentially equal to  that of a film with backlit
              illumination can be achieved.  The study will be restricted to the
              investigation of a  technology for static displays.    This research is
              important since it is estimated that the  cost of using film for radiographic
              procedures is  substantial.  A filmless system should not only decrease the 
              costs associated with film but also should improve the  overall productivity
              associated with clinical care.  ***
