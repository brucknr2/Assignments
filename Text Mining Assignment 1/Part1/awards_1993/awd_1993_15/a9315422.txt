Abstract    :
              9315422  Sulkin    Western Washington University proposes to renew their
              Minorities  in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) at the Shannon 
              Point Marine Center.  The objective of MIMSUP is to increase the 
              representation of targeted rachial/ethnic minority students in  marine science
              professions. This program recruits minority  undergraduates for two quarters of
              their junior year.  Eight minority students will participate in an educational
              program  that combines an initial phase of specialized instruction, followed 
              by formal courses in an integrated setting. The Winter Quarter  provides
              fundamental training in the physical, chemical and  biological processes basic
              to marine science; workshops on use of  sophisticated analytical
              instrumentation; participation in  monitoring and research projects; a journal
              club; and field trips.   The Spring Quarter includes three marine science
              courses. Students  will receive 30 credits for these two quarters. WWU has
              allocated  a faculty position to Shannon Point to supervise the program.
