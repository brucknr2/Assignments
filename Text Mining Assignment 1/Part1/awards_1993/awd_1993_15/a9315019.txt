Abstract    :
              9315019  Muench  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program 
              ("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the
              eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B.
              Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here concerns how
              regional-scale circulation features  affect the smaller-scale turbulence
              features.    This project consists of two spatially nested experiments.   A
              small scale experiment will use the ship's Acoustic Doppler  Current profiler
              (ADCP) to measure the fluctuating current  structure at one meter depth
              intervals in the upper layers of the  ocean.  A mesoscale experiment will make
              use of current,  temperature, and salinity observations to define
              regional-scale  features and to observe their feedback effects.    These
              measurements, in conjunction with other concurrent  experiments to quantify the
              energy brought to the underside of the  ice, will form the basis of a regional
              study of the processes  responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer
              and thin ice  cover.  It is believed that these conditions are only marginally 
              stable, and are maintained by a relatively high upward heat flux,  which, if
              interrupted, could lead to deep vertical convection, and  a significant change
              in the oceanic climate.  ***
