Abstract    :
              9315536  Schowalter  This award of $190,000 is for curriculum development in 
              computational science and engineering.  The focus is on to develop  new
              computational science and engineering courses and to transform  prototype
              applications into instructional tools.  The curriculum to  be developed as a
              part of this effort includes both an application-  independent course and a set
              of application-specific courses.  The  new application-independent course will
              contain material that is  common to the use of computational methods in science
              and  engineering which includes  architectures of high-performance  computers,
              programming paradigm, and interactive visualization.   For application-specific
              course will include characterization of  the application, numerical and
              symbolic methods, and performance  measurement for application code.
