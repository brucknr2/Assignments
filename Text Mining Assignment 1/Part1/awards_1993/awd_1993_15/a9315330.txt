Abstract    :
              9315330  Latanision    This award supports the participation of 12  U.S.
              scientists and engineers in a U.S.-Japan  Seminar on Development and
              Environmental  Characteristics of New Materials, to be held in  June 1994 in
              Mount Hood, Oregon.  The seminar  is co-organized by Professor Ronald
              Latanision,  Department of Materials Science and  Engineering, Massachusetts
              Institute of  Technology, and Professor Koji Hashimoto,  Institute for
              Materials Research, Tohoku  University, Sendai, Japan.  Several new and 
              advanced materials will be discussed at the  meeting, including amorphous
              alloys,  composites, coatings, electronic materials, and  intermetallic alloys.
               The speakers will focus  on the environmental degradation of such  materials. 
                The objective of the seminar is to understand  the present status of new
              materials known to  have high resistance against environmental  attack, and the
              environmental characteristics  of other new materials that have attractive 
              physical and chemical properties but whose  chemical behavior must be
              determined before  such materials may be used in service.  The  seminar brings
              together leaders in the  corrosion science and engineering communities 
              (university, industry, and national  laboratories) from both countries to
              establish  a shared research agenda that will lead to more  timely and
              effective introduction of new  materials into engineering systems that serve 
              society throughout the world.  ***
