Abstract    :
              9315935  Wanamaker      The PI will perform an experimental laboratory
              investigation of the electrical conductivity of polycrystalline olivine plus
              silicate melt rocks to elucidate the variables important in controlling
              conductivity in partially molten rocks and to constrain extrapolation of
              conductivity measurements to the deep earth.  Synthetic analogues of simplified
              partially molten mantle rocks will be used to study systematically the
              dependence of electrical conductivity on melt distribution as a function of
              temperature, oxygen fugacity, and a.c. frequency.  The sensitivity of melt
              distribution, and thus conductivity, to changes in volume of melt and the
              interfacial energies of the melt-solid system will be assessed by independently
              varying both the melt fraction and melt composition at fixed temperature and
              oxygen activity.  By subsequently investigating the effect of changes in
              temperature and oxygen fugacity on the frequency response, electrical
              conductivity will also be used to measure the kinetics of melt migration,
              equilibration, and ionic diffusion.  Electron microscopy observations will link
              the electrical results with structural changes in the samples.  ****
