Abstract    :
                 Program checking is a new approach to software fault-tolerance.  For a
              program that computes a function, a checker  tests whether the  program's
              output is correct for a specific  input.  Even when the program makes 
              mistakes, the checker  uses the program itself to perform the test by applying 
              the  program to several inputs related to the original one.  The  checker 
              provides a probabilistic guarantee of correctness on  a particular input on 
              which the program is executed, whereas  formal program verification establishes
               correctness on all  inputs prior to execution.    In this project, traditional
               fault-tolerance techniques are combined with program checking to produce  new
              kinds of  program checkers that are effective for programs of  practical size.
              In particular, program checking is  combined with  certification trails and
              with algorithm-based  fault-tolerance, a technique for  concurrent error
              detection.  Further, program checking is applied to  operating  system
              algorithms that ensure the truth of predicates such  as mutual  exclusion,
              deadlock avoidance, and serializability  of concurrent transactions.
