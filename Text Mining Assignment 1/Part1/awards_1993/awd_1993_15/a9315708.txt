Abstract    :
              9315708  Lomatch  A new design component, the multi-layered tunnel junction,
              consists of a vertically stacked array (a one dimensional superlattice) of
              Josephson tunnel junctions will be studied both theoretically and
              experimentally in consideration for application in superconducting electronic
              circuitry.    The proposed research includes the computer modeling of circuit
              designs employing multilayered junction technology, and the use of this
              information or the engineering fabrication and testing of multi-layered
              junction circuits.  The application to superconducting logic and memory
              circuitry, such as single flux quantum and Josephson transmission line devices,
              will be focus.  ***
