Abstract    :
              9315239  Smith  The Sixth Biology Symposium, sponsored by the Scientific
              Committee  for Antarctic Research, will convene in Venice, Italy in late May, 
              1994. This meeting, held every six years, will emphasize the  species,
              structure and survival of Antarcic communities. Topics to  be emphasized
              include Antarctic Biodiversity, Life History  Strategies, and Environmental
              Change and Human Impact. Over the  years, this symposium has become an
              excellent forum for the  international community of researchers to share data
              and new ideas  coming from their research. This award is a Group Travel Award, 
              which will provide partial travel support to researchers at United  States
              institutions. The ability for these scientists to  participate in the symposium
              will lead to increased scientific  knowledge and should result in further
              international cooperation in  Antarctic research.  ***
