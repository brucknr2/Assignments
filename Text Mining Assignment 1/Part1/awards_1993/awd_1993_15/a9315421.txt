Abstract    :
              9315421  Berlyn  This award provides continued support for the operation of the
              Escherichia coli  Genetic Stock Center located at Yale University.  The Stock
              Center maintains a  collection of around 7,000 genetically defined stock
              cultures of E. coli strain  K-12.  The Stock Center distributes these strains
              to the world-wide  community of scientists.  Requests come from investigators
              and teachers in  the fields of microbial genetics, molecular biology,
              biochemistry, biophysics,  medical research, biotechnology and related fields
              who are working in  academic and governmental laboratories, non-profit research
              institutes,  industrial laboratories and biotechnology firms.  In addition to
              the cultures  themselves, the Stock Center provides information on the
              histories,  derivations, and genotypes of mutant derivatives of E. coli K-12
              and on the  identification and genetic mapping of genes on the chromosome of E.
              coli.  The  Stock Center also serves as a point of coordination for the
              assignment of gene  symbols, allele numbers and strain designations.  During
              the last granting  period, many of the information functions have been
              computerized and much  of the information is now available on-line to the
              public.  During the next five  years, the Stock Center will continue its
              service to the scientific community  and will make its operation more efficient
              by expanding the electronic  databases so that investigators can not only
              access the information but also  use it to advance their research at their own
              terminals.  In addition, the  retiring Director, Dr. Barbara Bachmann will
              publish one final genetic map of  E. coli during the next award period.
