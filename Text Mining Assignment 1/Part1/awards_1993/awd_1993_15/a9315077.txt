Abstract    :
              9315077  Hawkridge    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research
              project between Professor Fred  Hawkridge, Department of Chemistry, Virginia 
              Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, and  Professor Isao Taniguchi,
              Department of Applied  Chemistry, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto,  Japan.  The
              joint research involves studies of  the interfacial characteristics of
              electrode  surfaces and the properties of metalloproteins  that control
              electron transfer reactions of  proteins in general at electrode surfaces.     
              Although much has been established in this  field in many different research
              groups, work  to be done in this project would bring together  electrochemical,
              spectroelectrochemical, and  surface characterization methods to probe these 
              interfacial reactions.  These investigations  should strengthen the
              investigators' efforts to  elucidate heterogeneous ET kinetics of proteins  and
              enzymes at electrode surfaces.  Professor  Taniguchi's expertise in 
              spectroelectrochemistry will be invaluable to  the identification of the
              ligated species at  the electrode surface and will prove the  underpinning to
              Professor Hawkridge's  assessment of the effects of ligand binding on  the
              electrochemical properties of biomolecules.  ***
