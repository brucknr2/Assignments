Abstract    :
              9315844  Carmichael  The Jalisco Block has geological properties that are in 
              stark contrast to the neighboring regions of western Mexico,  such as the
              geological succession, volcanism, grade of  metamorphism, faulting and relief;
              it is an exciting but  largely unknown area.  We propose to:  (1) document
              geologic  and tectonic aspects of the Jalisco Block that distinguish  it from
              its surroundings and define it as a tectonically-  independent block.  We will
              also determine whether extensive  eruptions of plateau basalt characterize
              extension along the  Block's northern margin and whether the sources of these 
              voluminous basalts are in the aesthenosphere or the  lithosphere; (2) determine
              the uplift/exhumation history of  the Jalisco Block using the stratigraphy of
              the volcanic  cover and mineral assemblages of exposed plutons and their 
              metamorphic envelopes; (3) determine the direction of  relative motion between
              the Jalisco Block and the North  American plate (for the last 10Ma), by
              examining datable  faults that frequent the bounding rift zones of the Block.
