Abstract    :
              9315323  Mourou    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in physics between the University of Michigan's Science and 
              Technology Center for Ultrafast Optical Science directed by  Gerard A. Mourou
              and the Laboratory for the Application of  Intense Lasers, Ecole Polytechnique,
              led by Denis Pesme. The  award principally supports an exchange of advanced
              graduate  students and postdoctoral researchers.  The objective of their 
              research is to test some of the fundamental concepts of the so-  called
              wakefield acceleration.  Specifically, they propose to  develop laser
              amplifiers with the aim of producing ultrashort and  high-energy pulses, and to
              investigate laser-plasma interactions  in the relativistic regime.    The U.S.
              investigators are world leaders in the field of  ultrashort, high-energy
              pulses.  Most techniques developed by  this group are used worldwide. This is
              complemented by the French  group's vast experience in the general field of
              laser-plasma  interactions; for example, in the ionization of gas by 
              multiphoton absorption and in laser-plasma interaction at the  nanosecond
              regime.  The project will advance understanding of  outstanding problems in
              condensed matter physics (e.g., high  temperature superconductors) through the
              application of new  technology in ultrashort optical pulse generation.  ***
