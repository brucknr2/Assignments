Abstract    :
              Ortiz-Leduc  9415446  Molecular chaperones are involved in the translocation,
              folding,  and assembly of polypeptides in chloroplasts and mitochondria.   This
              proposal is based on the premise that a novel 60,000 Mr  polypeptide that
              accumulates in chloroplasts of temperature-  stressed Euglena gracilis is a
              chaperone of the conserved cpn60  family.  In this regard, the 60,000 Mr
              species appears to be a  functional chaperone at the normal growth temperature
              (23 C) but  nonfunctional at elevated temperatures.  Thus, a failed chaperone 
              response could be at the rootcause for the irreversible loss of  chlorophyll
              (and photosynthesis) observed at the moderately  elevated temperature of 33
              C--a phenomenon known as heat bleaching.   Western blot analysis will be used
              to confirm the identity of the  novel 60,000 Mr species in bleaching Euglena
              using commercial  antibodies to bacterial and mitochondrial cpn60.  We will
              carry in  vivo and in organello pulse-labeling experiments to study the 
              ability of chloroplast cpn60 to associate with newly synthesized  polypeptides
              at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures.  We will  also isolate cpn60 from
              Euglena chloroplast extracts using size-  exclusion chromatography and
              density-gradient centrifiguration.   Finally, we will attempt to show that
              isolated Euglena cpn60 can  mediate the in vitro reactivation of chemically
              denatured  dihydrofolate reductase at normal and heat-shock temperatures.  If, 
              as expected, cpn60 fails to perform as a chaperone at high  temperatures,
              future works will focus on the molecular basis of  Euglena cpn60 dysfunction
              using recombinant DNA technology.  %%%  The proposed research focuses on a
              group of proteins--the  chaperones--that play a vital and fundamental role in
              the cells of  living organisms from bacteria to plants to humans.  Chaperones 
              normally assist other proteins during folding, during transport  across
              biological membranes, and during assembly of large  multiprotein structures. 
              In addition, chaperones appear to protec t  cellular structures against damage
              from heat stress when organisms  experience potentially lethal temperatures. 
              The process of photosynthesis in plants is notoriously sensitive to  high
              temperatures.  The unicellular alga Euglena gracilis, in  particular, appears
              to be unusually sensitive to temperature  because the algo loses chlorophyll
              and chloroplast function when  cultures are grown at the moderately elevated
              temperature of 33 C.   Unfortunately, research on plant chaperones and their
              role during  periods of heat-stress has received proportionately less attention
               than chaperones in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian systems.  Advances in
              agriculture are intimately tied to the ability of  plants to harvest light
              energy and convert it to biomass.  In this  regard, cereals, an important crop
              in Plain States, are also  sensitive to heat stress and fail to develop
              functional  chloroplasts when seedlings are grown at 33 C.  Using Euglena as a 
              simple model system, we want to investigate why chloroplasts are  sensitive to
              high temperatures.   The failure of chloroplast  chaperones to function
              properly at 33C could explain why  photosynthetic structures are not adequately
              protected from heat-  stress.
