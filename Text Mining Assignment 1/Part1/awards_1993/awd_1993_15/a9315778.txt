Abstract    :
              9315778  Kodama       Recent paleomagnetic studies have indicated that sediment 
              compaction may result in inclination shallowing.  As paleomagnetic  inclination
              is used to determine paleolatitude, unrecognized  compaction-caused inclination
              shallowing would result in under  estimation of paleolatitude.  This study will
              involve rock  magnetic, paleomagnetic and experimental compaction work to 
              determine a method of recognizing and correcting for compaction-  caused
              inclination shallowing in sediments and sedimentary rocks.   Results will be
              applicable to platetectonic reconstructions in  which paleomagnetic
              inclinations from sediments are used.
