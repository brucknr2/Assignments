Abstract    :
              This project is an investigation into a new generation of  hierarchical
              partitioning methods motivated by the need to 1) cope  with high circuit
              complexity, 2) improve a system's performance  under I/O pin count constraints,
              and 3) control intermodule delay  in order to optimize system performance.  The
              principal  investigator proposes to extend previous partitioning research by 
              adopting different circuit models including petri nets, data flows,  and state
              machines, by improving the efficiency and effectiveness  of the methods, and by
              deriving theoretical results on variations  of partitioning formulations.  He
              plans to apply partitioning  methods to netlist mappings for various hardware
              emulation machines  and to find potential applications of these methods to VLSI
              design  problems
