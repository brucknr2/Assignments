Abstract    :
              9315649  Deierl    This award supports a two-year collaborative  research
              project between Gregory Deierlein,  Assistant Professor, School of Civil and 
              Environmental Engineering, Cornell University,  and two researchers in Japan:
              Dr. Ryoichi  Kanno, Steel Research Laboratories, Nippon  Steel Corporation,
              Tokyo and Dr. Isao  Nishiyama, Building Research Institute,  Ministry of
              Construction, Tsukuba.  During two  research visits to Japan, Dr. Deierlein
              will  collaborate with the Japanese researchers on  issues of seismic design
              and analysis of steel  and composite structures.  The project focuses  on the
              physical testing of building connections  and subassemblages, computational
              research  using nonlinear analysis of building systems,  and current design
              practice.      Japanese researchers have been devoting  considerable attention
              to the development of  new types of structural systems based on  composite and
              hybrid construction.  This work  suggests that many changes in construction 
              techniques may be possible to improve  reliability and economy.  In particular,
              Nippon  Steel is a world leader in the development of  improved steel materials
              and products for the  building construction industry and has state of  the art
              research laboratories and production  facilities.  ***
