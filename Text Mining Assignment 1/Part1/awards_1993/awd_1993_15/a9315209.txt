Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Murphy's                      
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry. The research                    
              deals with the synthesis of colloidal semiconductors and their                 
              application to molecular recognition by DNA, open framework                    
              structures and tuneable nonlinear optical materials. In the                    
              molecular recognition studies, colloidal CdS and CdSe will be                  
              used as an inorganic mimic of the globular protein histones                    
              about which DNA strands wrap themselves. The luminescence                      
              spectrum of the semiconductor cores upon irradiation will                      
              provide insights into the nature and mechanism of DNA wrapping                 
              and unraveling that accompanies DNA replication and                            
              transcription. Hollow spheres of CdS and CdSe, which may                       
              exhibit unusual photoluminescence, will also be prepared and                   
              embedded in polymer films and sol-gel glasses. These materials                 
              should be attractive for nonlinear optical applications. Since                 
              the luminescence of CdS and CdSe is sensitive to surface                       
              adsorbates, nonlinear optical properties can be tuned by                       
              adsorption of molecules on the encapsulated colloids.

              Quantum-sized colloidal semiconductors have size and surface                   
              properties which lend themselves to a variety of diagnostic and                
              optical applications of academic and technological significance.
