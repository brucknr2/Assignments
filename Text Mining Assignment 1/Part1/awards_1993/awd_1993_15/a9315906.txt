Abstract    :
              9315906  Rotello  This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Rotello's 
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry award. The focus  of the research
              will be on molecular processes in non-Newtonian  fluids. Solution organization
              will be used to model the  ordered, yet dynamical environment created by
              protein and  nucleic acid structures. The dynamic pockets formed in these 
              solutions will provide many of the features present in  enzymatic catalysis
              such as local concentration of reactants  and conformational "pressure". The
              magnitude of these effects  can be monitored by NMR and varied by modifying
              physical  conditions such as spin rate and sample tube size. Molecular 
              recognition and catalysis will also be studied in non-Newtonian  solutions. 
              %%%  Non-Newtonian fluids are widespread in nature including blood,  the
              interior of globular proteins and protoplasm. These  typically aqueous polymer
              solutions vary their viscosity as a  function of the applied stress. This
              research will address the  fundamental nature of biological and synthetic
              polymers under  non-Newtonian conditions.  ***
