                          This award supports the participation of 11 U.S. scientists in a
              U.S. Japan Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Seminar on Photoinduced Electron
              Transfer at Semiconductor Interfaces    Fundamamentals and Applications.  The
              seminar, which will be held March 12 14, 1995 in San Diego, CA, is being co
              organized by Professor Thomas Mallouk, Department of Chemistry, Pennsylvania
              State University, and Professor Kohei Uosaki, Department of Chemistry, Hokkaido
              University, Sapporo, Japan.  The seminar will focus on recent advances in the
              fundamental science of light dirven electron transfer at semiconductor
              surfaces, and new applications of semiconductor photochemistry.  Seminar
              sessions will be organized around themes of fundamental studies of charge
              transfer, photoelectrochemistry, photosensitization and photocatalysis, new
              materials and devices, and novel applications of semiconductors.  Understanding
              electron transfer and chemical reactivity at the interface between
              semiconductors and solutions is key not only to emerging energy conversion
              technologies, but also to a variety of newer applications including
              environmental remediation, microlithography, optical computing, and information
              storage.  Both the fundamental and applied sides of the problem are now the
              subject of intense research and development efforts in both countries.  The
              seminar will bring together U.S. and Japanese specialists from strong research
              programs to exchange information o n new developments in this field.
