Abstract    :
              Buss  9315082    This  Accomplishment-Based Award will allow Dr. Buss to 
              continue work on colony integration in the clonal marine  benthos.  The primary
              objective in recent years  has been an  attempt to understand the causal basis
              of the correlation  between growth morphology and life history in clonal 
              organisms.  Dr. Buss has (1) demonstrated that hydroid  gastrovascular
              circulation is controlled by the spatial  distribution of polyps, which act as
              pumps, and stolons,  which conduct gastrovascular fluid between polyps, (2) 
              developed techniques that permit automated collection of  data on
              gastrovascular dynamics and (3) demonstrated that  perturbation of
              gastrovascular circulation generates  predictable alterations in growth
              morphology and life  history.  Dr. Buss  will develop a computer model that
              will  predict the growth morphology and life history  characteristics of model
              colonies and will validate this  model experimentally.  Together with work on
              establishing  that expression of pattern-forming genes is elicited by 
              transduction of hydrodynamic signals, he will expect to  unambiguously
              establish the causal basis of the relationship  between growth morphology and
              life history.  ****
