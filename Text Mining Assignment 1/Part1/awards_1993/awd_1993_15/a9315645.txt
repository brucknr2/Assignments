Abstract    :
              9315645  MIX    This study has two primary goals: 1) To test two recent
              hypotheses  that seek to explain the apparent disequilibrium of Delta-13C (and 
              possibly Delta-18 O) in calcitic shells of symbiotic and asymbiotic  planktic
              foraminifers. The first of these theories arises from  laboratory culture work
              on Orbulina universa and states that  photosynthesis by algal symbionts creates
              a light-dependent, but  temperature-independent, Delta-13C enrichment in the
              shells of  symbiotic species such as O. universa, G. sacculifer, and G. ruber, 
              which issuperimposed on the combined host-symbiont respiratory  Delta 13C
              depletion.  The second theory, based on coral data and  abiotic laboratory
              studies but which may apply to planktic  foraminifers, postulates a linked
              kinetic disequilibrium in both  Delta-13C and Delta-18 O that depends on
              calcification rate.  2) To  evaluate the importance of deep calcification on
              the isotopic  composition of foraminiferal tests.  There is considerable
              evidence  from sediment trap and plankton two studies to suggest that much of 
              the isotopic composition of planktic foraminifers arises from  equilibrium
              calcification at depths well below the euphotic zone -  between 100m and 1000m
              depending on the species in question. It is  important to consider both these
              research topics when attempting to  evaluate the factors that control the
              isotopic composition of  planktic foraminifers. It is possible for example,
              that the  apparent observations of deep equilibrium calcification noted above 
              are in fact due to disequilibrium calcification in the euphotic  zone. 
              Alternatively, deep equilibrium calcification superimposed  on euphotic zone
              disequilibrium calcification could greatly obscure  climatic information
              recorded in the foraminiferal test.  Answers  to these questions will have a
              profound effect on the climatic  interpretation we place on isotopic results
              from planktic  foraminifers.
