Abstract    :
              9315322  Hockberger  The goal of this project is to  build a bridge between
              advanced  concepts of neurocontrol from  neuroengineering, and substantial 
              experimental evidence on control  systems in higher organisms.  Past 
              collaborations between biologist  and experts in neurocontrol have  been
              relatively few and theoretical   in nature (Madhavan et al., 1993).   On
              theoretical grounds, they have  suggested that the inferior olive  in the
              mammalian brain is an  example of what is called an  "adaptive critic" network
              in  neuroengineering.  The purpose of  this project is to provide the  first
              serious experimental  evaluation of the theory, and if  possible, some
              empirical  understanding of the learning  mechanisms used to adapt that 
              network.  If successful, this  project should open the door to  much better
              two-way communication  between theory and experiment, to  the benefit of both;
              thus learning  mechanisms in the brain once   identified might in engineering, 
              and ideas from engineering might be  used to develop a more mathematical 
              understanding of these circuits.   The results form this project will  be
              incorporated into ongoing  theoretical collaborations between  biologist and
              engineers.  ***
