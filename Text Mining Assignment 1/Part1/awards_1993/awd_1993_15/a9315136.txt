Abstract    :
                9315136  Peterson    In various globular clusters, stars are distributed along
              the  horizontal branch in quite different ways.  Although mass loss on  the red
              giant branch is widely thought to be responsible for this  distribution, the
              underlying parameter which controls the mass loss  has not been established. 
              The PI will measure rotation velocities,  oxygen abundances and helium
              abundances for horizontal branch stars  in clusters with a range of properties.
               This will help to  establish whether any of these parameters play an important
              role in  horizontal branch evolution.  ***
