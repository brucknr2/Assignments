Abstract    :
              9315941  Graham       A joint Stanford-Mongolia team will:  1) study Mongolia's 
              Mesozoic tectonics through comprehensive basin analysis studies;  and 2)
              investigate Mesozoic climate as recorded in extensive  accumulations of
              nonmarine Mesozoic strata, comparing results with  published global climatic
              models of Mesozoic Asia.
