Abstract    :
              9315954  Ahrens      The PIs will extend their measurements of shock wave
              pressure-density measurements for molten silicates and magmas from the present
              range of available data to the entire pressure and temperature range of the
              present and primordial mantle.  They will also conduct shock wave experiments
              in the same regime on liquid, glass, and single crystals of MgSiO3,
              (Mg0.9Fe0.1)SiO3, and CaMgSi2O6.  These data can be used to calculate shock
              temperatures, and more importantly, isentropic temperature changes in a
              convecting magma ocean or upon ascent of magmas from depths in the Earth.  They
              will systematically study the equation of state of molten fayalite to 40 GPa in
              order to understand the effects of Fe2+ on the equation of state of molten
              mantle silicates.  In addition, they will investigate a high pressure phase
              transition in serpentine in order to further understanding of the effect of
              water on the high pressure elasticity of mantle silicates.  ****
