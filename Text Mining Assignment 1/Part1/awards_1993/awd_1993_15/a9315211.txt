Abstract    :
              9315211  Conti  The major objective of this project is to develop and test 
              strategies for reducing costs of the delivery of  PET  services, i.e., to lower
              the cost of diagnosis, while  maintaining  both the quality of, and access to,
              PET  services.  A detailed cost analysis of the cost of PET  services at
              current levels of efficiency, and for newly-  proposed alternative operational
              and organizational  configurations, will be prepared, as will paradigms which 
              optimize the utilization of the equipment and supplies.  The  cost analysis is
              to be prepared using financial data from  several institutions and will be
              compared to the actual  experience at the University of Southern California.
