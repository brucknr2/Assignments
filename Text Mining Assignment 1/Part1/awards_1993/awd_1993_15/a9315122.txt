Abstract    :
              9315122  French    This award supports the participation of nine  U.S.
              scientists and engineers in a U.S.-Japan  Seminar on Structural Performance of
              High-  Strength Concrete in Seismic Regions, scheduled  for November 1994 in
              Honolulu, Hawaii.  The  seminar is co-organized by Professor Catherine  French,
              Department of Civil and Mineral  Engineering, University of Minnesota, and 
              Professor Fumio Watanabe, Department of  Architectural Engineering, Kyoto
              University.  In  addition to the U.S. and Japanese participants,  scientists
              from Australia, Canada, and New  Zealand, are expected to attend.    A large
              quantity and variety of test data on  high-strength reinforced concrete has
              become  available through recent test programs conducted  in the United States,
              Japan, Canada, New Zealand,  and Norway.  These data include information on 
              material development, structural performance, and  construction procedures. 
              The seminar will focus  on the design and performance of high-strength 
              reinforced concrete structures located in seismic  regions.  Participants will
              exchange recently  acquired data, evaluate the data, and develop  rational
              design recommendations.  In the process,  deficiencies in the database and
              future research  needs may be identified.
