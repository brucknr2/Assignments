Abstract    :
              9315506  Crawford       The sunflower family of plants, the Compositae or
              Asteraceae,  is one of the largest in the world, with ca. 20,000 species, and 
              has attracted a large proportion of scientists in taxonomic and  evolutionary
              biology.  Since the last international meeting where  a synthesis of
              information was attempted on the family, in 1975,  the Compositae have been the
              subjects of new molecular methods of  DNA analysis and of numerous other
              studies on morphology, life  histories, natural products, and ethnobotanical
              uses.  Dr. Daniel  Crawford of Ohio State University is coordinating travel
              grants for  several U.S. participants to attend an international conference on 
              the systematics and evolution of the Compositae, to be held at the  Royal
              Botanic Gardens in Kew, England.  Graduate students and  faculty researchers
              are eligible for travel supplements to attend  this two-week conference. 
              Recent studies of phylogeny, genome  organization and change, hybridization,
              diploid-level speciation,  natural products chemistry, pollination and
              dispersal, life history  evolution, and ethnobotany will be highlighted.  The
              conference  anticipates attendees from many countries in America, Europe, 
              Africa, Asia, and Australia.       The first international conference on the
              Compositae, held in  1975, led to publication of a synthesis volume with wide
              and  lasting impact on studies of systematics and evolution of the  sunflower
              family of plants.  The second conference at Kew is likely  to achieve similar
              distinction, and in particular will highlight  recent findings from new
              molecular technologies applied to DNA and  genome organization in these plants.
