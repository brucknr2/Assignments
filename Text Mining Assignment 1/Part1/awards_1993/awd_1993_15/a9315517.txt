Abstract    :
              9315257  Allen  This award of $200,000 is for curriculum development in Machine 
              Vision.  The goal is to create hands-on laboratory modules that  effectively
              describe and explain new algorithms in machine vision  in interactive, live
              image environment.  These modules will be  implemented on standard UNIX-based
              graphics workstations using  public domain toolkits based on X-windows.  They
              will be entirely  portable and usable in any classroom at any university.  The 
              modules will be developed by leveraging off of two important and  current
              developments: a common software environment for image  understanding being
              developed by ARPA, and recent progress in  multimedia authoring tools for
              creating interactive computer  tutorials.  The proposed work entails designing
              the components,  interface, and layout of the modules; evaluating different
              toolkits  and interface construction kits; testing and distributing a number 
              of modules to other sites; and evaluating the use of the module  format and
              authoring facilities by other researchers.
