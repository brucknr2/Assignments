Abstract    :
              9315312  Winn    Work is underway on a time-series study of the inorganic carbon
               cycle in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.  The work is part of  the US
              JGOFS Time-series study at Hawaii (Hawaii Ocean Time-series,  HOT). 
              Measurements are being made of all four carbon system  parameters including
              dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity,  pH, and pCO2.  Samples are
              collected approximately monthly on the  HOT cruises to Station ALOHA.  Ongoing
              intercalibration work is  continuing with other laboratories to insure the
              accuracy of the  data.  The time series record of the carbon system is to be
              used to  assess the direction and magnitude of air-sea carbon system 
              parameters within the main thermocline. The ultimate goal is to  improve our
              ability to predict the oceanic response to the oceanic  role in, future climate
              change.
