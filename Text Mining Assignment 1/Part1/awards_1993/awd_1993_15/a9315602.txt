Abstract    :
              Mehta  9315602  The Wind Engineering Research Center (WERC) and the Institute
              for  Disaster Research at texas Tech University have pursued intensive 
              wind-related research for over twenty-three years.  Besides  extensive
              wind-storm-induced damage documentation and research  regarding wind effects on
              buildings and structures, these research  centers have excelled through
              accomplishments such as development  of a full scale building field test
              facility, a missile impact test  facility, and a wind engineering library
              containing close to 3,000  wind-related documents.  The WERC is currently
              involved in an NSF  sponsored cooperative wind engineering project with
              Colorado State  University that involves faculty and students from the
              departments  of Civil, Chemical and Mechanical Engineering, as well as 
              atmospheric sciences.  In the present grant, the results of these  research
              accomplishments will be transferred to the curriculum of  these and other
              departments.  Visual aids such as instructional  video modules, color slide
              sets and detailed notes on pertinent  topics will be prepared.  These materials
              will then be integrated  into different courses offered in the courses both in
              the  undergraduate and graduate levels.  These instructional aids can  also be
              used by other universities offering similar courses.   ***
