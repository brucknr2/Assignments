Abstract    :
                9315321  Garinther    The Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics and Biomechanics 
              (CHABA) is a standing committee of the National Research  Council of the
              National Academy of Sciences.  This committee  provides scientific expertise
              and advice to the Federal  government agencies on issues related to human
              hearing,  posture, and vibration sensitivity.  The committee responds  to
              Federal and other requests for information, and selects  working groups from
              among experts in the field to address  particular issues.  The written reports
              receive further  review before publication by the National Research Council, 
              to ensure high scientific credibility for the information to  be used in
              further decisions.  This project is to maintain  an NSF contribution to share
              with other agencies the ongoing  support of this unique activity that provides
              scientific  advice for national needs.  ***
