Abstract    :
              9315914  Kaner    In this research, metathesis reactions are used to prepare 
              refractory and electronically and magnetically important  materials. These
              reactions are effective for the rapid synthesis  (< 2 s) of a large variety of
              materials. Targeted systems include  refractory main group borides, carbides,
              nitrides and phosphides  and conductive refractory transition metal nitrides
              and  phosphides and magnetic rare earth phosphides. Additionally,  special
              efforts will be made to refine methods for the  preparation of metastable high
              temperature compounds. Further  studies will examine the processing of ceramic
              materials,  specifically studying the effects of varying crystallinity and 
              particle size on the densification and mechanical properties of  hot-pressed
              samples.  % % %  Direct solid-state reactions often are complicated by the need
               for long reaction times at elevated temperatures. Metathesis  reactions allow
              the preparation of materials in seconds. In this  research, metathesis
              reactions are used to prepare refractory and  electronically and magnetically
              important materials. The effects  of varying crystallinity and particle size on
              the densification  and mechanical properties of hot-pressed samples will be 
              explored.  ***
