Abstract    :
              9315110   FROELICH    Recent advances in our understanding of minor biological 
              fractionation of Ge/Si by oceanic diatoms suggest that Ge/Si)opal  variations
              measured in late Pleistocene piston cores and Cenozoic  drill cores are
              recording whole ocean (Ge/Si)seawater variations  driven by rapid and large
              glacial to interglacial changes in  continental weathering intensity and river
              fluxes to the sea. If  so, then it is clearly important to produce high
              resolution records  of (Ge/Si)opal in cores with well-established  18 O and 14C
               stratigraphies across transitions to establish the shape and timing  of the
              oceanic Ge/Si response relative to other climate and  weathering indicators. 
              In addition, in order to resolve whole  ocean changes in the face of small
              biological fractionation  effects, it is necessary to carefully evaluate and
              remove the  effects of Ge/Si fractionation in local records.  With the 
              development of a rapid and highly-sensitive HG-ICP-MS Ge-method,  these
              problems can be addressed and unraveling the causes and  timing and ocean
              chemical variations can begin.  As a result, this  is aimed at accomplishing
              two major goals: (1) Produce high  resolution late Pleistocene (Ge/Si)opal
              records in cores that  contain abundant diatoms and forams in collaboration
              with others'  measurements of the appropriate paleogeochemical tracers in the 
              same cores (e.g. 87Sr/86Sr); and (2) Provide tests to refine the  effects of
              Ge/Si biological fractionation with diatom cultures,  hydrographic and core top
              transects, and runs of the Hamburg ocean  Ge/Si model.  In addition, opal
              paleoproductivity work in the  Antarctic (expanding into the North and South
              Pacific Oceans), and  other ancillary programs will be continued.
