Abstract    :
              9315830  Hammer  This award supports continued research on Triassic and Jurassic
              age  vertebrate material collected in the Beardmore Glacier region of  the
              Transantarctic Mountains.  The fossils include Triassic  synapsids and the
              first Jurassic dinosaurs from Antarctica.  This  continued funding is required
              because of the large amount of  material that was collected during the previous
              field work and  because of the time consuming nature of fossil preparation
              work.   The collection to date has produced at least five taxa of Jurassic 
              age, including a new large crested carnivorous dinosaur.  Other  dinosaur
              material includes portions of a prosauropod and teeth of  a scavenging
              carnivore.  In addition to the dinosaur material,  other Jurassic animals
              identified include a pterosaur and a  tritylodont synapsid.  Early Jurassic
              fauna under study is one of  only a few high latitude faunas known and so has
              considerable  paleoclimatic significance.  In addition, because Early Jurassic 
              terrestrial vertebrate faunas are relatively rare, these fossils  could provide
              significant information about the evolution of  lineages between the Late
              Triassic and the Middle to Late Jurassic.   Preparation of the Triassic
              material will follow the completion of  the Jurassic material.   ***
