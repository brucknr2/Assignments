Abstract    :
              9315628  Tauxe      The PI will investigate several promising approaches to
              normalization of magnetic paleointensity records in sediments.  She will test
              the methods using two time slices (0 and 10 ka) in recent box cores taken over
              a large area of the Ontong-Java Plateau; two box cores will be selected for
              continuous sampling in order to compare the two time series with the full range
              of normalization parameters available.  She will then construct two parallel
              time series of relative paleointensity data from the Ontong-Java Plateau
              spanning the last three to four million years.  Finally she will analyze a set
              of samples collected from the Oligocene Contessa Quarry section in Umbria,
              Italy, in order to construct a second record spanning Chron C12R to compare
              with one recently obtained from DSDP Leg 73's Site 522 from the South Atlantic.
