Abstract    :
              9315753  Link  The purpose of the research is to assemble a broad base of 
              longitudinal quantitative information related to  collaborative research
              arrangements between firms.  This  information will come from (1) an
              analysis/evaluation of  Federal Register filings of cooperative research
              ventures  that are required under the National Cooperative Research  Act of
              1984 and are maintained-but not analyzed--by the  Office of Technology
              Commercialization of the Department of  Commerce and (2) survey/analysis of
              collaborative research  activities from a sample of 250 US manufacturing firms
              for  each of the years 1990-1993.  The Principal Investigator has  received
              agreement from the Bryan School of Business at the  University of North
              Carolina at Greensboro to maintain  (annually resurvey) and expand (at least 50
              new firms will  be added to the base each year) the project for at least  five
              years.  The data base, which will be available to other  researchers upon
              request, will be used to identify trends in  the various dimensions of
              industrial cooperative research  arrangements.    The project will be completed
              in three phases: Phase I will  include analysis and evaluation of the
              population of Federal  Register filings and creation of a data base of related 
              information.  Phase II will consist of the collection of  survey-based
              information from a sample of 250 U. S.  manufacturing firms related to annual
              collaborative efforts  (quantified in a number of dimensions) for each of the
              years  1990-1993 and the creation of a. longitudinal data base.  Phase III
              represents the expansion of the longitudinal data  bases over a five-year
              period after the project is completed  using institutional resources.
