Abstract    :
              9315979  Wali       The 4th International Symposium on Particles, Strings and 
              Cosmology will be held on the campus of Syracuse University under  the auspices
              of the Physics Department from May 19-24, 1994.  Interdisciplinary in nature,
              the symposium will cover wide  ranging topics of interest to both theorists and
              experimentalists  and will attempt to provide as complete a picture as possible
              of  the current status of Particle Physics, String Theories, and  Cosmology. 
              The interactions which will occur at the symposium  are very important to
              progress in the field.  ***
