Abstract    :
                9315133  Lamb    The investigators will use the techniques of condensed
              matter,  nuclear, gravitational and computational physics to study the 
              properties of matter under the extreme conditions found in and near  neutron
              stars, black holes and white dwarfs, to study the structure  and evolution of
              neutron stars and to study the physical processes  that occur in accretion onto
              these objects.  The results of these  fundamental studies will be used to model
              systems containing  compact stellar objects for comparison with observation. 
              This work  will contribute both to our understanding of compact stars and our 
              understanding of physical processes at very high densities.  ***
