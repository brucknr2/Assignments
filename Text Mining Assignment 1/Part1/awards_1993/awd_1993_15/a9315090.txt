Abstract    :
              CTS-9315090  University of Colorado  Richard D. Noble      ABSTRACT    Ag{SYMBOL
              43 \f "Symbol"}- doped Nafion and block copolymer, ionomer membranes will be
              prepared for separations involving alkanes, monoenes and dienes.  Preliminary
              data indicate high selectivities with these systems.  Adsorption isotherms and
              transmembrane fluxes for single component and multicomponent feed mixtures are
              to be measured.  Microstructure will be varied by means of solvent swelling and
              synthesis of different block copolymers in order to understand the results with
              Nafion and to extend them to other classes of polymers.    Interest in
              membrane-based separations derives largely from possible savings in energy and
              associated environmental and economic costs.  Many consumer products from
              automobile tires to electronic devices to detergents depend on purification of
              olefins for high quality.
