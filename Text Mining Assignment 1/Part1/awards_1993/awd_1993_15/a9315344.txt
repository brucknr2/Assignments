Abstract    :
              9315344  Lin  Discrete event systems (DES) are used to model man-made systems 
              that are not readily described by the differential or difference  equations
              used in traditional control theory, but rather by  interactions of events that
              record significant qualitative  changes in the systems.  Several approaches to
              modeling, control,  and optimization of DES have been proposed, each addressing
              a  specific issue and providing an important piece of the entire  puzzle of
              DES.  However, these pieces are as yet separate and  disconnected to a large
              extent.  Furthermore, some approaches  suffer from exponential computational
              complexities.  To overcome  these obstacles, the aim of this proposal is to
              develop a  comprehensive theory of DES.  In this theory, efficient 
              implementation of on-line control will be provided; component  failures will be
              diagnosed; hard time constraints will be  satisfied; temporal performance will
              e evaluated; and hybrid  systems will be considered.  If successful, this
              comprehensive  theory will bridge the gap between two major approaches in DES: 
              qualitative approach addressing the logic issues and quantitative  approach
              addressing performance issues.  It will also connect  research results in
              discrete event systems with those in  continuous variable systems.  It will
              further provide  computationally efficient ways to implement control.  All
              these  will greatly enhance the applicability of DES methodologies.  ***
