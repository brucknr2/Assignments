Abstract    :
                Kramer  9315091      The project goal is to gain a better understanding of how
              the  growth of coccoid marine cyanobacteria is regulated by nitrogen  supply. 
              The approach will be to build a strong theoretical and  methodological base
              using studies of laboratory cultures.  The  project will be directed towards
              the development of nucleic acid  probes and antisera to glutamine synthetase
              and nitrate reductase.   Together with specific probes for rRNA, these tools
              provide a  direct means to analyze variations in the nitrogen assimilation 
              system and general physiological state caused by variations in  nitrogen
              supply.  The results will be used to provide detailed  analyses of patterns of
              gene regulation in chemostat cultures of  marine Synechococcus spp.  These
              studies comprise a comprehensive  effort to develop and implement the means to
              determine the  molecular biological basis of the responses of autotrophic 
              picoplankton to nitrogen flux in the sea.   ***
