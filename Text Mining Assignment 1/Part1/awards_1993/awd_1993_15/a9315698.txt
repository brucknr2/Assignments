Abstract    :
              9315698  Hauri  This new proposal will apply detailed textural, 
              thermobarometry, ion microprobe, and Sr-Nd-Pb and Os  isotopic analyses to
              suites of ultramafic xenoliths hosted  by alkali basalts on the oceanic islands
              of Savai'i (Western  Samoa), Tubuai (Austral Islands), Tahiti and Tahaa
              (Society  Islands), Hiva Oa, Ua Huka and Nuka Hiva (Marquesas  Islands), Oahu
              (Hawaiian Islands) and Aitutaki (Cook  Islands).  The relationship of these
              xenolith suites to  volcanism at these islands will be examined by undertaking 
              Sr, Nd, Pb and Os isotopic studies of stratigraphically  controlled basalt
              sections from Tubuai, Oahu (Koolau and  Honolulu Volcanics) Mauna Loa, and
              Tahaa.  We propose  extensive use of Os isotopes as tracers of compatible 
              elements in peridotites and mantle-derived magmas in order  to distinguish melt
              interaction with lithospheric versus  plume derived mantle sources.  Research
              will focus on  specific issues such as:  1) mantle plume versus  lithospheric
              origin for OIB-hosted xenoliths, 2)  contribution of the oceanic lithosphere
              sources to isotopic  variations in oceanic island basalts, 3) contrasting
              styles  and products of magma-mantle beneath individual islands, as  a function
              of lithospheric age, thickness, and temperature,  and 4) the extent to which
              the physical and chemical  characteristics of magma migration are controlled by
               variations in texture and grain size of the mantle.
