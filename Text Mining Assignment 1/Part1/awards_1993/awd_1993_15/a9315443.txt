Abstract    :
              9315443  Triman       The general approach outlined in this research involves
              the  study of seven plasmid-encoded 16S rRNA mutations; each mutation  disrupts
              a specific G-C basepair in or near a region of  Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal
              RNA involved in interaction with a  ribosomal protein.  Genetic and biochemical
              studies of these  mutations will include (1) site-specific mutagenesis to
              introduce  compensatory changes, (2) analysis of chemical and enzymatic 
              probing of mutant rRNA with and without the appropriate ribosomal  protein
              bound, and (3) characterization of the expression of the  mutations under
              conditions in which one or more chromosomal rRNA  operons have been
              inactivated.  The goal of this work is to  elucidate the role of specific
              nucleotides in the structure and  function of 16S ribosomal RNA.  %%%  The aim
              of this study is to improve our understanding of the  molecular mechanism of
              protein synthesis.  The focus of our work  is an RNA molecule found in the
              ribosome, the site of protein  synthesis in all living organisms.  The general
              approach outlined  in this proposal involves the use of genetic and biochemical
               techniques to investigate the structure and function of 16S  ribosomal RNA
              from bacteria.  Genetic studies involve the  introduction of mutations at each
              of seven positions in 16S rRNA  and the characterization of the effects of
              these mutations on  protein synthesis in bacteria.  Biochemical studies include
               experiments designed to test the ability of mutant 16S rRNA to  bind purified
              ribosomal proteins.  The goal of this work is to  understand the importance of
              specific 16S rRNA nucleotides in the  structure and function of the ribosome.
