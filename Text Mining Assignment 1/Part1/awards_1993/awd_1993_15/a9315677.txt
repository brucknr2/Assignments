Abstract    :
              9315677  Malshe  Recent advances in the synthesis of diamond films have enhanced
              the  possibility for the use of diamond coated surfaces in numerous 
              applications that include optics, thermal management devices and  moving
              mechanical assemblies.  Specific examples include;  telescopes, night vision
              lenses, high power laser optics, laser  diodes, heat spreading devices for
              multichip modules and coatings  for improved wear, enhanced lubricity and
              corrosion protection in  moving systems.  One major disadvantage of diamond
              films grown  using CVD methods is that they are polycrystalline and thus
              usually  tend to have a rough surface morphology.  This variation in surface 
              roughness causes scattering of light, thereby reducing the  usefulness of
              optics in many applications.  Polishing is one  approach by which this
              scattering can be reduced.  Conventional  approaches to polishing are only
              marginally efficient because of  the high hardness associated with diamond.  In
              the Phase-I effort,  Materials Modification Inc. (MMI), successfully
              demonstrated the  feasibility of using a non-contact polishing method for the 
              polishing of CVD-diamond films.  Preliminary results demonstrated  that surface
              roughness can be reduced from 5-10 um to a few  nanometers within a few hundred
              seconds.  In Phase II, MMI intends  to comprehensively study the laser
              polishing method by optimizing  the process parameters for large area
              polishing.  This experience  in processing will then be used by MMI for
              demonstrating the  fabrication of polished CVD diamond films for high quality
              diamond  windows.  ***
