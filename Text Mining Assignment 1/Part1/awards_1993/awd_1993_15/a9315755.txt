Abstract    :
              9315755  Welsch    Arrays of pinning centers (microstructural fences) are
              introduced  to pin grain boundaries by introducing dopant below the surface by 
              ion implantation.  Bulk materials are created by laminating the  implanted
              layered material according to desired patterns for  achieving high strength
              materials.  The research involves ion  implantation, structural
              characterization by transmission electron  microscopy, and mechanical testing. 
              Several parameters are  explored related to the fences that are created in the
              layers.   These include implantation concentration, species, temperature, and 
              post annealing treatment.  Studies include bubble pinning point  determination,
              bubble and grain growth kinetics, and grain size  (related to Hall-Petch
              strengthening).   %%%  A benefit of this research could be creep-resistant
              metal alloys  for high temperature use.  Improved low-temperature fracture 
              toughness could also be a product from the research.  ***
