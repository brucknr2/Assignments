Abstract    :
              9315013   Rotenberg   The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
              (CPSR)  Washington Office of the Computer Professionals for Social 
              Responsibility (CPSR) has organized important conferences on  emerging
              cryptography and privacy policy issues.  These conferences  are critical to the
              continued effectiveness of the Internet and all  the networks that interconnect
              to it.  CPSR will bring together all  new stakeholders in the networking
              enterprise including private  companies, public interest organizations, and
              federal agencies to  discuss the impact of federal policies on the deployment
              of  cryptography and the development of privacy standards.  The CPSR  requests
              partial support for a workshop to plan a framework for  these new privacy
              standards for achieving electronic privacy.  This  conference will bring
              together many academic and government  representatives including some European
              experts in cryptography  technology.
