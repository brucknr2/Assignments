Abstract    :
                9315445  Bodily    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research
              project between Professor David  Bodily, Department of Chemical and Fuels 
              Engineering, University of Utah, and Professor  Kiyoshi Higuchi, Department of
              Mineral  Resources, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.   The focus of the
              project is on methane recovery  from coal beds.  The investigators will 
              exchange information on the measurement of coal  seam methane content, perform
              tests to compare  measurements under the same conditions with  each group's
              equipment, and construct a model  to simulate methane recovery.  ***
