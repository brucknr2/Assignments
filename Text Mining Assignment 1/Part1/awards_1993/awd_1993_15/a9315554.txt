Abstract    :
              Mullineaux  9315554      Vent communities are populated largely by endemic
              species  that are restricted to an ephemeral environment where  life- 
              sustaining vent fluids may persist for periods as short as  decades.  It is
              known that physiological adaptations of some  vent species play a role in
              dictating their distributions,  but the roles that recruitment, competition and
               predation/biological  disturbance play during vent  colonization remain
              largely explored.  This study will  conduct a set of in  situ manipulative
              experiments  to  test  the roles of these processes in creating patterns of 
              distribution of vents invertebrates.  Basaltic settlement  plates will be
              exposed in regions that differ in intensity  of vent fluid flux to manipulate
              the intensity of  physiological stress and nutrient availability, and 
              colonization will be followed.  These  studies  will address  fundamental
              ecological processes in vent communities and  provide a key link between
              studies of larva dispersal and  population genetics.    ***
