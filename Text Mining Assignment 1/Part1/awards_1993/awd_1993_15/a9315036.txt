Abstract    :
              9315036  Crawford      This award will support a graduate student to investigate
              the feasibility of using naturally occurring neutrinos to map the density
              distribution through the Earth's mantle and core.  Theoretical investigations
              show that it is possible to determine variations in density - and possibly
              composition - as a function of depth by measuring the absorption of neutrinos
              passing through the planet.  By taking advantage of the initial deployment of
              the DUMAND II detector array, the PIs and graduate student will be able to
              document experimentally the practical utility of this method.  The outcome of
              this project could revolutionize our understanding of the geodynamical and
              geochemical evolution of the Earth's deep interior.  ****
