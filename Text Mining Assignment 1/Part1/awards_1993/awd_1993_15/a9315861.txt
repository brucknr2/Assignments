Abstract    :
              9315861  Saka  Partial support is provided to a symposium which will explore the
              relative roles of tribology and surface engineering, where tribology is defined
              as the study of surfaces in relative motion, and surface engineering is seen as
              the intended creation of surfaces with specific properties.  ***     n   o
