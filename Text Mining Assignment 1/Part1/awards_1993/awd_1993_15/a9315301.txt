Abstract    :
              The Marine Board of the National Research Council's (NRC)                      
              Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems serves the                     
              national interest by providing, as a result of requests from                   
              sponsoring agencies, or on its own initiative, evaluations and                 
              advice concerning ocean developments and uses and the nation's                 
              ability to meet its marine and maritime goals.  The board                      
              considers questions of the relation of engineering and technology              
              to coastal and offshore resource development and operations; to                
              navigation and the commerce of the sea, waterways, and ports; to               
              related human resources and onshore activities; and their                      
              relation to the establishment and implementation of public                     
              policies.  The Board identifies opportunities and needs for new                
              technologies and other developments and recommends appropriate                 
              actions.  It stimulates the exchange of information and                        
              cooperative activities, and provides a forum for the national and              
              international professional community.                                          
                                                                                             
              The activities through which the Board accomplishes its program                
              are: (1) assessments of the technical capability to undertake and              
              manage offshore and maritime developments and uses, including the              
              adequacy of knowledge to support technology development; (2)                   
              evaluations of safety of personnel and of the environment; (3)                 
              assistance in the preparation and assessment of the government's               
              program directed to ocean and maritime developments and uses; and              
              (4) identification of future opportunities for the integration of              
              advanced technology into marine or maritime systems and the                    
              influence of technical advances on the establishment and                       
              implementation of public policy.
