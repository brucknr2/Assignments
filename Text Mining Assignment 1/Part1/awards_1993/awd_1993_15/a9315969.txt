Abstract    :
              9315969  Rikvold  The proposed research consists of two main parts: lattice gas 
              modelling of phase transitions in electrochemical adsorption, and  the study of
              metastability near first-order phase transitions.   Both projects employ
              non-perturbative statistical mechanical  numerical methods; ie Monte Carlo
              simulation, finite-size scaling  and transfer matrix calculations.  (1) The
              electrochemical  adsorption of urea, acetic and oxalic acid molecules and of 
              chloride and phosphate anions onto single crystal platinum surfaces  will be
              simulated and directly compared with experimental  observations.  (2)
              Metastability near first order phase transitions  in simple model systems will
              be examined via transfer matrix  techniques which produce complex valued free
              energies - the  imaginary part being proportional (it is believed) to the
              lifetime  of the metastable state. These lifetimes will be compared with  those
              obtained by more direct numerical methods.  %%%  This work involves the
              understanding of phase transitions - both at  the fundamental level and at the
              system-specfic level.  In the  latter case, the adsorption of molecules and
              charged ions at  electrodes in solution will be modelled and compared directly
              to  experiment.  In the former case, metastability near abrupt phase 
              transitions (eg supercooling of water below the melting point) will  be studied
              via a new mathematical method which gives the lifetime  of these states
              directly.  These lifetimes will be compared with  estimates from nucleation
              theory and from direct numerical  modelling.  ***
