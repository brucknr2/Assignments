Abstract    :
              Hollibaugh  9315639      The goal of the project is to understand the
              relationship  between: 1) the taxonomic composition of microbial  communities;
              2) their metabolic capabilities and the  presence of characteristic metabolic
              pathways; and 3) the  sources of organic matter fueling bacterioplankton 
              production.  To do this, we propose to continue development  and testing of a
              technique for describing bacterioplankton  community structure based on an
              analysis of  variable  regions of the 16S  rRNA gene.  We will characterize the
               metabolic capabilities of bacterioplankton communities by  assessing their
              abilities to grow on single carbon sources  and by the metabolic fate of
              exogenously supplied thymidine.  The statistical procedure of principal
              components analysis  will be used to compare  these community characteristics
              and  to develop a matrix of the metabolic capabilities and  phylogenetic
              characteristics of bacterioplankton population.  The sources of C fueling
              bacterioplankton production will be  assessed by comparing the C and N stable
              isotope signatures  of bacterioplankton DNA with those of organic matter 
              fraction form the same location.  The work will be conducted  in San Francisco
              and Tomales Bays, in coastal waters around  San Francisco and in estuaries and
              coastal water off the  East coast over a 3 year period.  ***
