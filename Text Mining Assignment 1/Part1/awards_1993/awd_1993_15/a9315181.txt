              9315181  Kumar  This award of $180,000 is for curriculum development in 
              computational science and engineering.  The focus is on to develop  new
              Railroad Transportation Cuuriculm for undergraduates and  starting graduates. 
              The core courses and selective courses will be  deveoped in Mechanical
              Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical  Engineering, Computer Science, and
              Business.   The certificate  program will be developed to satisfy the need of
              the industry by  providing a series of related courses in the rail engineering
              area  for retraining staff.  A introductory graduate courses and program  will
