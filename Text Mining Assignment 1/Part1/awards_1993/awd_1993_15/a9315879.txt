Abstract    :
              9315879  Elias  This award will fund a project to generate artificial  neuronal
              systems using a VLSI technique for processing  visual information.  The
              neuronal network will be composed  of electronic neurons, each with dendritic
              trees, impulse  generating soma, axonal arborizations and synapses.  Pulsatile
              signaling will occur between neurons.  A genetic  algorithm will be used to
              modify the interconnections  between the neurons.  The analysis of the evolved
              neuronal  microcircuits are expected to uncover mechanisms of visual  motion
              processing and suggest methods of developing  artificial neuronal visual
              processing systems.    This proposal was submitted to the Biosystems Analysis
              and  Control Initiative which encouraged the submission of  proposals that
              through the study of neurophysiological  systems could advance engineering
              science and advance the  knowledge of biological systems through the use of 
              engineering analysis techniques.  The research being funded  by this award has
              the potential to advance both  neurophysiological sciences and the field of
              engineering in  the area of visual motion processing.  ***
