Abstract    :
              9315749  Tyburczy      The PI will study a series of texturally equilibrated
              partially molten olivine-basalt systems at one bar total pressure, to examine
              the influence of grain size, temperature, oxygen fugacity, bulk composition,
              and melt fraction on the grain boundary electrical response.  He will also
              develop methods to extend this work to elevated temperatures and pressures (up
              to 2000 C and 20 GPa) in a multiple anvil apparatus.  The results of this study
              will be important for the interpretation and modeling of magnetotelluric data
              and will also shed new light on grain boundary transport processes in a variety
              of geological environments.  The ultimate benefits will be a more detailed
              understanding of the temperature profile and state of the Earth's interior.
