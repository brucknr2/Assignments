Abstract    :
              9315416  Sebo    This awards supports the participation of seven  U.S.
              scientists and engineers in a U.S.-Japan  Seminar on Electromagnetic Field
              Effects Caused  by High Voltage Systems, scheduled for June 1994  in Sapporo,
              Japan.  The co-organizers are  Professor Stephen Sebo, Department of Electrical
               Engineering, Ohio State University, and Professor  Katsuo Isaka, Department of
              Electrical and  Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima,  Tokushima,
              Japan.  In addition to the U.S. and  Japanese participants, scientists from
              Malaysia  and Sweden will take part in the seminar.    The seminar deals with a
              fundamental and complex  scientific subject.  Many key elements of highly 
              advanced social system are sensitive to  electromagnetic interference.  The
              electric power  generation-transmission-distribution systems, 
              computer-communication-information-control  systems of any kind, radio and
              television  stations, national security, and social  institutions are examples
              for such elements.   Electric power systems themselves are also causes  of
              electromagnetic interference.      The seminar will address these main
              subjects:   (1) modeling, characterization, and evaluation of  the electric
              power system related to  electromagnetic fields; (2) studies related to  the
              environmental effects of high voltage  transmission systems, including possible
               biological effects, human perception, and  telephone system performance; and
              (3) measurement  techniques of electromagnetic fields covering a  broad
              frequency range, including procedures and  standardization.  ***
