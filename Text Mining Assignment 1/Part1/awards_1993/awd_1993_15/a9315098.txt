Abstract    :
              9315098  Ulrich  Synoptic observations of the surface of the sun using the Mt. 
              Wilson solar tower will be continued.  One series of observations  consists of
              a daily drawing of the solar surface since 1920 while  a second provides a
              daily magnetogram since 1967.  Beginning in  1986 several dopplergrams have
              been obtained each day.  As time  permits, other observations for particular
              purposes are made.  The  data from this program support various solar studies
              including the  NSF Global Oscillation Network Group project and the NASA Solar 
              Maximum Mission.  ***
