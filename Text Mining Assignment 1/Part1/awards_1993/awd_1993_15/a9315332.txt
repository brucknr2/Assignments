Abstract    :
              9315332  Kagawa    This award supports a three year cooperative  research
              project between Professor Takaaki  Kagawa, Department of Civil and
              Environmental  Engineering, Wayne State University, and  researchers at the
              Earthquake Engineering  Laboratory, National Research Institute for  Earth
              Science and Disaster Prevention, Science  and Technology Agency.  The two
              principal  Japanese co-investigators in that laboratory  are Chikahiro Minowa
              and Nobuyuki Ogawa.  The  joint research will first investigate and  clarify
              the lateral soil-reaction responses of  piles through experimental efforts
              involving  (a) model pile-section tests conducted in the  United States and (b)
              shaking-table tests  conducted in Japan.  The objective of the  research is to
              develop a new methodology for  evaluating the seismic performance of pile 
              foundations in potentially liquefiable soil  deposits.    Pile foundations have
              experienced damage and  failure during major historical earthquakes,  due
              mainly to the failure of foundation soils  caused by liquefaction.  A number of
              studies  have been conducted in recent years on the  dynamic behavior of
              isolated piles and of  groups of piles, to increase our understanding  of
              dynamic soil-pile interaction.  The state of  the art in this field, however,
              has not  advanced to a point where we can predict the  performance of piles
              when foundation soils  undergo liquefaction during an earthquake.   This joint
              research project will provide an  improved insight into lateral soil-pile 
              interactions in liquefying saturated sands, and  with a basis for developing
              rational seismic  design guidelines for pile foundations in  potentially
              liquefiable soil deposits.  ***
