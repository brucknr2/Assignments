Abstract    :
              9315074  Bradt    In recent years numerous x-ray sources have been discovered
              from  satellite observations.  To learn the nature of these objects it is 
              generally necessary to observe them in other parts of the spectrum, 
              particularly in the visible region.  To this end, a long-standing  program of
              optical studies of X-ray sources will be continued under  this grant.  It will
              include identification of x-ray sources  discovered by ROSAT and HEO-1
              satellites and determination of the  masses of black holes in previously
              identified sources.
