Abstract    :
              9315393  Majerfeld    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  solid state and microstructures between Arnoldo Majerfeld, 
              University of Colorado, and Pierre Tronc, Ecole Superieure de  Physique et de
              Chimie Industrielles, Paris, France. The objective  of their research is to
              investigate the physical properties of p-  type gallium arsenide multi-quantum
              wells and superlattices. They  will examine their use in infrared photodectors
              and imaging.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
              the  fabrication and electrical and optical characterization of these 
              structures. This is complemented by the French theoretical and  computational
              expertise in optical absorption and electrical  transport. The proposed
              research has important commercial  applications and will advance understanding
              of the design of normal  incidence infrared photodectors.  ***
