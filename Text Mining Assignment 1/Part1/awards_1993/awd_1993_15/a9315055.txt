Abstract    :
              9315055  McCaffrey    This research is to continue seismological investigations
              of  Sumatra through analysis of data from a digital seismograph network  that
              has been operating around the Sumatra fault and Toba caldera  in northern
              Sumatra since October, 1990.  The maximum depth and  depth distribution of
              seismic failure on the Sumatra fault, the  relation of the earthquakes and
              their fault plane solutions to  geologic structures, the seismic velocity
              structure and attenuation  beneath the fault and Toba caldera, and the
              relationship of the  subducted slab and a possible tear within it to surface
              tectonics  will be studied.  The seismic network operates within a GPS 
              geodetic network operated by Rensselaer and Scripps and provides  the
              opportunity to study the spatial and temporal relations between  seismic
              activity and geodetically measured strain.  The work is  being done in
              cooperation with the Indonesian Meteorological and  Geophysical Agency
              (Jakarta) who operate the seismographic networks  in Indonesia.  This research
              is a component of the National  Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
