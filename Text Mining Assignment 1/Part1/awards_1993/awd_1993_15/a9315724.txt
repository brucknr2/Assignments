Abstract    :
              9315724  Simo       PI will investigate the relationship between and test three 
              hypotheses addressing controls on carbonate-slope-megabreccia  deposition and
              the formation of drowning unconformities.  The  project will integrate
              geochemical and field techniques to provide  a chronostratigraphic framework
              and to evaluate the setting and  processes of these megabreccias and associated
              unconformities.  The  platforms to be studied are Cenomanian-Turonian in age,
              located in  the south-central Pyrennees, Spain.
