Abstract    :
                9315068  Sneden  The production and distribution of elements in the Galaxy can
              be  most directly studied through high resolution spectroscopy of  nearby
              stars.  The elemental abundances in old disk and population  II giants, in
              metal-poor field stars and in globular cluster giants  will be determined. 
              Spectra of selected stars will be used to  determine the abundances of calcium
              and sodium in interstellar  clouds in the galactic halo.  Although diffuse
              interstellar bands  have been observed in reddened stars for a long time, the
              agent  responsible is still not identified.  A new strategy involving  lightly
              reddened stars will be pursued to identify them.   ***
