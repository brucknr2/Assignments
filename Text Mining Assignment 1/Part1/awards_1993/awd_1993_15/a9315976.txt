Abstract    :
              9315976  Jirsa  This project organizes and convenes a research workshop to 
              identify the directions and to develop strategies for NSF's  earthquake
              engineering and earthquake-related earth science  research in the next decade. 
              The objective of the workshop are  threefold:    1. To review current
              activities and achievements under the     National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
              Program (NEHRP) with a     focus on those under NSF sponsorship.    2. To
              examine NSF policies and management of the Earthquake     Hazard Mitigation
              (EHM) program and the Fundamental     Earthquake Studies (EAR), including
              problem-focused research,     which may enhance or limit the future role of
              NSF.    3. To develop recommendations, in broad terms, for areas and    
              programs where NSF can and should vigorously support NEHRP.    The Workshop
              program will be designed so that in addition to  meeting these stated
              objectives, it would (a) address the issues  raised in a recommendation made by
              the NEHRP Advisory Committee  in its report to the Congress, and (b) develop a
              long-range  strategic plan of research for NEHRP components at NSF.    This
              workshop is jointly supported by the Biological and Critical  Systems Division
              of the Directorate for Engineering and the Earth  Sciences Division of the
              Directorate for Geosciences.  ***
