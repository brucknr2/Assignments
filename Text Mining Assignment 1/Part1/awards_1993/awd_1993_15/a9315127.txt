Abstract    :
              9315127  Janecke    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor Joachim  Janecke, Department of Physics, University of 
              Michigan, and Professor Mamoru Fujiwara, Research  Center for Nuclear Physics,
              (RCNP) Osaka  University, Osaka, Japan.  In addition to  Professor Janecke, a
              postdoctoral fellow and a  graduate student from the University of Michigan 
              will visit Japan to participate in the joint  research project.    The Michigan
              researchers will perform experiments  related to the study of charge-exchange
              reactions  and the properties of giant resonances at the new  Ring Cyclotron
              Facility and the new magnetic  spectrometer Grand Raiden at Osaka University.  
              The particle energy available at the RCNP  facility favors spinflip
              transitions.  The  proposed experiments to investigate microscopic  structures
              of Gamow-Teller resonances and  characteristics of the charge-reaction
              mechanisms  in terms of isovector non-spinflip, spinflip, and  tensor
              interactions represent an extension and  continuation of work performed by the
              U.S.  principal investigator at the Indiana University  Cyclotron Facility over
              the past several years.   These experiments will yield new data that may  shed
              light on the character of isobaric analog  states.  ***
