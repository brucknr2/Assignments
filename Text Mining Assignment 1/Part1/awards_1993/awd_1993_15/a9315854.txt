Abstract    :
              9315854  Miles  This award will fund a project focused on understanding the 
              directional characteristics of an invertebrate's ear which,  because of its
              size and placement, must use novel mechanisms  to localize sounds.  The study
              will investigate both the  mechanics and the neurophysiology of the system to
              determine  if novel phase delay mechanisms are responsible for the  unique
              capability.    This proposal was submitted to the Biosystems Analysis and 
              Control Initiative which encouraged the submission of  proposals that through
              the study of neurophysiological  systems could advance engineering science and
              advance the  knowledge of biological systems through the use of  engineering
              analysis techniques.  The research being funded  by this award has the
              potential to lead to advances in  sensory system processes and, in addition,
              should enable  engineers to discover new methods to detect acoustic signals 
              for use in other engineering applications.  ***
