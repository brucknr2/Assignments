Abstract    :
                  9315285  Hankins  Although radio pulsars have been known for nearly three
              decades and  have been attributed to rotating neutron stars for nearly that 
              long, the mechanism producing the radiation is still poorly  understood. 
              Observational and theoretical studies will be  conducted to distinguish which
              of several existing models for  pulsar emission is correct.  The theoretical
              studies will focus on  the rapid fluctuations of the emission expected from
              various models  with the goal of uncovering features which will distinguish
              among  them.  The theoretical predictions will be tested through  observations
              with time resolution an order of magnitude better than  has been achieved
              previously.  ***
