Abstract    :
              9315240  Parsons  This project investigates large-scale civil infrastructures 
              using composite materials.  The focus of the research is on  development of
              innovative designs utilizing filament winding  manufacturing techniques for
              cost-effective, seismic  resistant pipe joints and bridge decks.    The
              research will produce effective conceptual design and  determine specifications
              for new material systems.  The  project will be conducted on the cooperative
              basis between  US and Korea and included design and testing.   The  structures
              produced will be light weight, and corrosion  resistant, thus reducing the
              inertia forces and aiding in  the replacement of damaged components.  ***
