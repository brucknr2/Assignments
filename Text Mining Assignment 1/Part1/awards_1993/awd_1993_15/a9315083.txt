Abstract    :
              9315083  Atema        Chemical  signals  play an important role in the  lives 
              of  many  animals for orientation to food, selection of habitats and  mates, 
              and  avoidance  of  predators.  It has been  shown  that  benthic  animals
              detect and respond to chemical signals produced by  other  animals  or  food 
              sources at distances of  centimeters  to  many  meters.   This  study will test
              the hypothesize that  the  micro-  scale pattern of concentration distribution
              of odors in a  current  provides  information  that is used by  animals  for 
              orientation  toward the odor source. Laboratory and in situ experimental  work 
              will be carried out to describe and quantify the  distribution  of  chemical 
              signals  in  aquatic odor plumes,  and  the  behavioral  responses of
              crustaceans to those plumes.  ***
