Abstract    :
              Srihari  9315006       This is a standard award in the NSF/ARPA Human Language 
              Technology for cooperative research on how to utilize new and  improved
              approaches to the recognition of handwritten text with the  support of language
              models based on linguistic knowledge, involving  researchers at the State
              University of New York at Buffalo and the  Eastman Kodak Company.  The approach
              concerns the use of contextual  constraints to improve the recognition and, at
              times, override the  results of classical pattern recognition.  This includes
              the use of  lexicons and holistic filtering, of dictionary statistics, and of 
              high-level syntactic and semantic post-processing.  Although the  research
              focuses on models of the English language, with emphasis  on the linguistic
              component rather than on the pattern recognition  component, and utilizes
              statistical training with representative  corpora, it can be extended to other
              European languages and to the  recognition of printed text.
