                    ABSTRACT  CTS-9315671  University of Maine  P. I.:  Albert Co     
              Experimental work will be undertaken to obtain steady-state features of the
              multilayer film casting process as functions of films configurations, fluid
              rheological properties and operating variables.  Instabilities in multilayer
              flows will also be studied experimentally, examining the onset of draw
              resonance and the characteristics of finite-amplitude disturbances in terms of
              film configurations, fluid rheological properties and operating variables.
