              project will investigate and model the neural control mechanisms of the united
              cardio respiratory control system. The research specifically proposed for this
              Small Grant for Exploratory Research period consists of exploratory development
              of a series of biologically realistic models that simulate the structural and
              functional organization of this neural control system at several hierarchical
              levels (from single neuron level to systems level) and that lead to
              understanding of the principles of distributed neural computations which
              provide for the robust and adaptive control of respiration. Based on Richter's
              theory of a network origination of the three phase respiratory rhythm, the
              investigators will develop a model of elementary neural network generator which
              incorporates the known data on single neuron properties of neurons of different
              respiratory groups and the data on interconnections between them. This model
              will simulate the genesis of the basic respiratory rhythm and specific patterns
              of activity of different respiratory neurons. At the same time, at the network
              level, we propose a concept of computation that is (in some sense) an
              alternative to the traditional connectionist approach. It is considered that
              there are many parallel interacting and competing elementary local generators
              in a  multistable distributed network of medullary respiratory neurons.  These
              elementary generators are able to generate their own respiratory oscillations
              but interact via interneural synaptic connections and operate under common
              feedback control from the periphery. This feedback synchronizes the elementary
              generators and provides the common respiratory rhythm. Thus, the common
              (adaptive and robust) respiratory rhythm results from self organization of the
              system of elementary parallel generators.   Simulation of this process,
              incorporating realistic neurons and multiple network generators, will require
              supercomputing facilities. Special attention will be focused on analysis of
              advantages of the considered type of parallel distributed computations and
              control. ***
