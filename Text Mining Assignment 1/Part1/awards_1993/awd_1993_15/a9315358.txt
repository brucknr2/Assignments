Abstract    :
              9315358  Doty  This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, 
              addresses simulation and preliminary hardware implementations for  exploration
              of the use of a "swarm" paradigm for organization of  multiple cooperating
              robots for robust, flexible material handling  in dynamic and uncertain
              environments.  The exploration emphasizes  collective behavior of agents with
              individually modest  intelligence, using a minimalist approach of variations on
              a single  basic building block.  The domain of exploration is manufacturing 
              work cells.  If such a system can have sufficient robustness  designed in, it
              could make robotics more appealing for  manufacturing applications.  Robust
              robotization of material  handling would also facilitate system control of the
              material flow  in a plant, thus supporting computer integration of
              manufacturing  operations.  This evolutionary design approach seems worthy of
              at  least initial exploration, and at the modest level requested, and  award is
              recommended.
