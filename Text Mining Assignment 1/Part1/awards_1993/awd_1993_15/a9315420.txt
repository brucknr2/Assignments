Abstract    :
              9315420  Maclay  This project is to develop and implement four new 
              interdisciplinary courses in Microstructure Systems and Mechanics  at the
              Junior/Senior/First year Graduate level.  The courses will  be modular in
              construction, and based on research advances made  at the University of
              Illinois Chicago Circle or presented in  critical reviews in literature.  The
              student laboratories, which  form a key part of the curriculum, would be based
              on a "problem  solving" approach.  The coarse modules will be available in hard
               copy or on CD/ROM.  The curriculum will be developed with input  from an
              Industrial Advisory Board and a faculty advisory group.   The evaluation of the
              curriculum will be done by the procedure  followed by the American Institute of
              Physics in their new  physics curriculum evaluation.
