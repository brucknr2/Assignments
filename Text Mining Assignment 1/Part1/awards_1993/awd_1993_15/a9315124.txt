Abstract    :
                  9315124  Lambert  The chemical compositions of stars in the Galaxy and in
              the  Magellanic Clouds will be determined.  The needed stellar spectra  will be
              acquired at the McDonald Observatory in Texas and national  observatories in
              Arizona and Chile.  Old and young stars which are  not evolved will be analyzed
              to determine how products of stellar  evolution have enriched galactic gas
              clouds.  Evolved stars will be  studied to compare their chemical abundances
              with the predictions  of stellar evolution theory.  ***
