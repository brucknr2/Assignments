Abstract    :
              9315199  Rao  This award of $180,000 is for curriculum development in smart 
              composite structures, which encompass several technologies that  enable
              flexible structures to sense and control their own  geometric, environmental
              and structural characteristics to achieve  high performance and self-diagnostic
              capabilities.  The work  necessitates the integration of (i) composite
              structure modeling  and fabrication, (ii) advances in sensor and actuator
              technology,  (iii) advanced control methodology, and (iv) artificial neural 
              networks.  The objectives of an interdisciplinary team of faculty  members are
              to: (i) introduce smart structure concepts to senior  undergraduate and
              graduate students, (ii) develop interdisciplinary  educational experience,
              (iii) enhance the design component of  curriculum and capstone design projects,
              and (iv) train future  scientists and engineers in areas of national importance
              and  technologies critical to defense missions.  The approach adopted is  to
              (i) develop a two-course sequence on smart structures, (ii)  integrate
              multidisciplinary laboratory experience with coursework,  (iii) develop senior
              undergraduate capstone design projects  soliciting feedback from an advisory
              committee in finalizing the  topics, and (iv) develop course materials and
              multi-media  instructional tools, and (v) disseminate curriculum development 
              results to the greater engineering community.
