Abstract    :
              9315872  Rieke    Development of the cryogenic spectrometer was funded by the 
              National Science Foundation in 1989.  At that time the instrument  included
              provision for upgraded capabilities which are now to be  implemented.  These
              capabilities include increased resolution from  approximately 700, or 3,700
              depending upon the grating, to  approximately 19,000.  An existing tip/tilt
              mirror system will also  be adapted to the instrument to improve the effective
              sensitivity  by stabilizing star images on the instrument slit.  The upgraded 
              resolution is to be accomplished with a new immersed-silicon  echelle grating. 
              The novel design of the instrument provides the  new capabilities at relatively
              low cost in comparison with facility  instruments at other observatories.  The
              spectrometer will be used  with the telescopes of the Steward Observatory as
              well as with the  upgraded 6.5 meter Multiple Mirror Telescope.  ***
