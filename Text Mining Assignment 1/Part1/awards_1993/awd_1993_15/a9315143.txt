Abstract    :
              9315143  Mueller    This award supports a two-year collaborative  research
              project between Professor Berndt  Mueller, Department of Physics, Duke 
              University, and Professor Hisakazu Minakata,  Department of Physics, Tokyo
              Metropolitan  University.  The primary purpose of the project  is to study QED
              (quantum electrodynamics) of  strong external fields and its ultimate goal is 
              to resolve the puzzle of peak structure  observed in the GSI experiments. 
              Professor  Alan Chodos of Yale University and Professor  Yee Jack Ng,
              University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill, will also participate in the 
              project.    The investigators will study several aspects of  the QED vacuum in
              the presence of a strong  external field:  (1) collective modes in the  QED
              vacuum? (2) chiral transition in the QED  vacuum? and (3) Dyson equation
              approach.  With  the beginning of the operation of the APEX  experiment at the
              ATLAS facility at Argonne  National Laboratory and the resumption of 
              experiments at GSI, interest in the physics of  QED in strong external fields
              is growing again.   The international collaboration will contribute  to the
              development of these experiments, as the  collaborators bring varying and
              mutually  supportive individual expertise to the effort.  ***
