Abstract    :
              9315720   Seybert   This project provides partial support for travel to St.  
              Petersburg, Russia, to participate in Noise '93-- an   International Conference
              on noise and vibration control. The most  common source of noise is a vibrating
              boundary, such as a panel   or some other component in a machine. Mechanical
              vibrations can   be caused by internal forces arising from functional elements
              of  the machine, such as forces resulting from the combustion in an   internal
              combustion engine or the impacts in a punch press.   Controlling noise and
              vibration is extremely important in order   to enhance efficiency and
              productivity in a manufacturing work   environment. The participation in the
              Noise '93 International   Conference provides an excellent opportunity for
              exchange of   ideas and learn innovative techniques from other participants for
               noise and vibration control.***
