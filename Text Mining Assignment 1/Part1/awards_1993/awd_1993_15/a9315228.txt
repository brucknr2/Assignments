Abstract    :
              9315228  Retallack  This award supports a study of Triassic paleosols in South 
              Victoria Land and in the Shackleton Glacier area of the  Transantarctic
              Mountains in order to extract information about  climatic conditions and about
              extant vegetation.  This part of  Antarctica is known to represent a
              continental interior  environment that was in a near polar position during the 
              Triassic.  This region was hospitable enough to support broadleaf  forests as
              well as large amphibians and reptiles.  However,  details of the
              paleoenvironments that would help differentiate  between, for example, woodland
              and shrub-land remain obscure.   Detailed study of Quaternary paleosols in many
              parts of the world  has proved very useful to understanding paleoenvironments. 
               Extension of these types of studies to the Triassic is feasible  at this time.
               Comparison of Triassic paleosols from Antarctica  to Quaternary and recent
              soils from temperate regions would  improve our understanding of climatic
              conditions and ecological  systems and would provide important information for
              global  circulation climate models.  ***
