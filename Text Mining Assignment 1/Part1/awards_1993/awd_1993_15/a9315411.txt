Abstract    :
              9315411  Rutledge  The major objective of this project is that by using modern 
              multimedia based approaches interactively presenting the subject,  compact disk
              storage devices for archiving the materials and  advanced authoring
              environments to aid the preparation of course  materials it is possible to
              substantially reduce the time to  develop new modules for the course called
              Integrated Chemical  Engineering.  Two research areas will be used to
              illustrate the  new approach.  One is the use of computational Chemistry
              methods  to aid the design of new polymeric materials.  Another test  module to
              be developed involves the synthesis of environmentally  benign chemical
              processing systems.
