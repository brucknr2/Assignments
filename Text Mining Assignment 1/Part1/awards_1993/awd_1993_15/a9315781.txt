Abstract    :
              George Stell is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his work in   statistical mechanical studies of
              liquids.  The research   focuses on understanding and predicting
              thermodynamics,   structure, and transport properties as a function of the  
              underlying interactions among the constituent molecules with a   special focus
              on ionic and dipolar fluids.  The methodology   which is used includes: 1)
              Ornstein-Zernike formalism for   treating molecular correlation functions
              between pairs of   particles; 2) Boltzmann's method which yields a hierarchy of
                equations relating molecular distribution functions; 3)   "replica" methods
              which enable one to relate quenched-annealed   systems to an equivalent class
              of fully equilibrated systems;   and 4) computer simulations.  Studies to be
              conducted include:   1) phase transitions and critical phenomena in ionic,
              dipolar   and off-lattice spin fluids; 2) Quenched-annealed binary   mixtures;
              3) Random sequential addition to surfaces; and 4)   spin glasses.    Stell's
              research provides an important molecular level   understanding of the detailed
              interaction of molecular species   in condensed phases.  This level of
              understanding is important   in the field of chemistry since the large majority
              of chemical   reactions take place either in aqueous solution or in the  
              liquid phase.  A more thorough understanding of the   thermodynamic and
              transport properties of condensed phase   systems, particularly ionic and polar
              fluids, will aid in the   design and engineering of efficient chemical
              engineering   processes.
