Abstract    :
              9315257  Passino  This award of $153,000 is for curriculum development in
              intelligent  systems and control.  The focus is on engineering analysis, 
              reliability, economics, and implementation of intelligent systems.   Several
              existing courses at Ohio State University will be combined  and developed into
              a new lecture-only course and a lecture-  laboratory course.  The first course
              will introduce intelligent  systems concepts, fuzzy logic and systems,
              contemporary fuzzy and  expert control techniques, and analytical techniques
              for  intelligent control systems, and will infuse research into the  classroom
              through introduction of current thesis topics that focus  on industrial
              applications and through guest lectures by colleagues  in academia, industry
              and government laboratories.  In the second  course, students will perform a
              series of experiments for an  introduction into experimental research and
              industrial  applications, and will complete a design project in intelligent 
              systems that includes laboratory implementation and practical  economic and
              reliability considerations.
