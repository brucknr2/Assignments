Abstract    :
              9315728  Meyer    Dr. Meyer will utilize the latest generation of
              charge-coupled-devices (CCDs)  at the NSF supported National Optical Astronomy
              Observatories to push the  sensitivity of interstellar absorption line studies.
               The principal goals in this  research are to: (1) measure an isotope ratio of
              lithium in several interstellar  clouds and determine if there is a global
              value for the solar neighborhood; (2)  obtain a better understanding of the
              apparent NH overabundance in diffuse  clouds; and (3) investigate the
              possibility that metal-bearing high velocity  clouds of low column density
              could be common throughout the halo of our  Galaxy.  The techniques being
              developed will be applicable to future studies  involving quasar absorption
              lines and the large ground-based telescopes  coming on line this decade.
