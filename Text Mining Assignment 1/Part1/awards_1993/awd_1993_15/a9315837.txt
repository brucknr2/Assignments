Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Initiation Career Advancement Award is                  
              made by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                        
              Chemistry Program to Dr. Gregory H. Robinson of the Chemistry                  
              Department, Clemson University, for exploratory research on the                
              synthesis of novel organoaluminum compounds.  Emphasis will be                 
              placed on the preparation and characterization of species                      
              containing aluminum-aluminum bonds.  The synthesis of a new                    
              class of compunds containing eight aluminum atoms in a cubic                   
              arrangement will be attempted.  Should the synthesis be                        
              successful, it would have important implications for main group                
              chemistry and the development of novel materials.  This award                  
              will enable Dr. Robinson to enhance the synthetic component of                 
              his research laboratory, which currently is well-known for                     
              structural characterization of main group compounds.
