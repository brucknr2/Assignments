Abstract    :
              9315780  Heller    This work is concerned with the chemical concepts for bonding
              10-  100 nm diameter monocrystallites of photoactive oxide semicon-     ductors
              with defined optical, electrical and photoelectrochemical  properties to
              different glass and ceramic substrates.  The  objective will be the building of
              a foundation for a bonding  technology, whereby bonding of the semiconducting
              oxide  crystallites to silicate glasses and ceramics would not introduce 
              damaging junctions with the substrate, i.e. would not result in  recombination
              centers that would drastically reduce the quantum  efficiency of the hole or
              the electron reactions at the opposite  interface, in contact with a gas or a
              liquid.  The approach is  based on modifying the back contact by an interlayer
              of an oxide  with an increased band gap, so that the change carriers will be 
              strongly repelled from the back.  ***
