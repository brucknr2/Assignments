Abstract    :
              9315980  Derby    Funded with a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, numerical 
              simulations are to be carried out of a process for growing  single crystal
              sheets. Finite element methods will be applied to  a radiatively melted fluid
              zone, contained by surface tension,  in which a polycrystalline sheet is
              subsequently reformed as a  single crystal. Items to be examined are the shape
              of the melt-  crystal interface, the meniscus shape, the overall heat 
              transfer, and the overall process stability.    The ability to grow single
              crystal semiconductor materials  directly in sheet form would permit drastic
              improvement in  process efficiency for the production of semiconductor wafers.
