Abstract    :
                   To assist developing countries and countries with economies               
              in transition formulate their climate-change policies, the United              
              States Government has committed $25 million over two years for                 
              the development of Country Studies to Address Climate Change.                  
              These studies will help establish an analytical and institutional              
              foundation upon which recipient countries may construct their                  
              national climate action plans and help those countries fulfill                 
              their obligations under the Climate Change Convention.  Following              
              review of proposals submitted by eligible countries, financial                 
              and technical support will be provided to selected counties to                 
              enable them to conduct inventories of their greenhouse-gas                     
              emissions, to assess their vulnerability to climate change, and                
              to evaluate response strategies for mitigating and adapting to                 
              climate change.                                                                
                   Agencies participating in the U.S. Global Change Research                 
              Program have been directed by the Office of Management and Budget              
              to transfer funds to one of the three agencies cooperatively                   
              managing the Country Studies initiative to be used for support of              
              the initiative.  This interagency agreement transfers $1,366,000               
              from NSF to the Environmental Protection Agency as directed by                 
              OMB for this purpose.
