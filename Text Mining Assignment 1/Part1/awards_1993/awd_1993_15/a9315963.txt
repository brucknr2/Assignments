Abstract    :
              9306387  Lu       The project will focus on several mathematical problems 
              related to the unique continuation property of partial  differential equations.
               This research is concerned with the  question of whether solutions of certain
              types of differential  equations can be equal to zero on an open set without
              being zero  everywhere. Here, the concern is whether recent improvements on 
              the classical Carleman method will produce a weak unique  continuation property
              of differential inequalities for small weak  norm on the potentials.  A second
              line of investigation  concerns weighted and nonweighted Sobolev interpolation 
              inequalities for vector fields. Inequalities of the  Poincare-Sobolev type for
              vector fields abound, but nothing much  has been done in the direction of
              interpolation inequalities.   Work will also be done weighted restriction
              results for the  Fourier transform with weights in the Fefferman-Phong class
              and  an effort will be made to obtain a sharp covering lemma in  n-dimensional
              Euclidean space refining earlier results of Stein  and Stromberg.       The
              combination of harmonic analysis and inequalities is  used to provide precise
              background information for  practitioners in partial differential equations. 
              The  inequalities developed give essential a priori information about 
              solutions as well as important estimates of their growth  properties.  ***
