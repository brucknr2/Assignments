Abstract    :
              9315526  Cummins  Depolarized light scattering is used to investigate dynamical 
              aspects of the glass transition in a number of glass formers,  including CKN,
              salol, ZnCl2 and glycerol.  A major objective of  the research is to compare
              the experimental data with the mode  coupling theory (MCT) of Professor W.
              Gotze, Technical University  of Munich, a collaborator in the project.  The
              researchers will  also carry out dielectric response, neutron scattering, 
              ultrasonic, and high-pressure measurements in collaboration with  other groups
              in an effort to reach a fully integrated picture of  the structural relaxation
              processes in supercooled liquids and to  clarify their role in the glass
              transition.  %%%  Despite much investigation, the fundamental nature of the 
              molecular structure of a liquid as it supercools to form a rigid  glass is not
              understood.  This project will use a number of  techniques, particularly light
              scattering to investigate the  glass transition and to use the results to test
              a recent theory  of the glass transition.  ***
