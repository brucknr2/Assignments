Abstract    :
              9315280  Shafter     Although it has been understood for some time that
              cataclysmic  variable stars are the result of mass transfer in binary systems, 
              their basic parameters are still poorly known.  Consequently it has  not been
              possible to determine how the various types of cataclysmic  variables are
              related.  This will be addressed by obtaining new  photometric observations to
              refine the orbital period distribution  and by obtaining spectra to measure the
              masses of the component  stars in the systems.
