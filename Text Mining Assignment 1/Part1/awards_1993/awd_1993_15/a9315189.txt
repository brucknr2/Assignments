Abstract    :
              9315189  Johnson    This award supports travel expenses of Markes Johnson,
              Department  of Geology, Williams College to visit China and participate in 
              joint research with Rong Jiayu, Nanjing Institute of Geology and  Paleontology,
              on Silurian rocky shorelines.  The researchers will  collaborate on a joint
              field study of a rocky shoreline of  Silurian age near Guiyang, China.      The
              fundamental value of an ancient rocky shoreline is its  unambiguous position
              marking the boundary between ancient land  and sea.  Many practical
              applications in paleogeography may be  derived from this starting point,
              including the evolution of  rocky-shore communities through geologic time. 
              This project will  be the first time an ancient rocky shoreline will be studied
              in  China.
