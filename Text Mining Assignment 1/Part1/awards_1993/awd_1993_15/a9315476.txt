Abstract    :
              9315476  Denning  This award of $156,000 is for curriculum development in
              complex  systems design.  This project will bring into the design portfolios 
              of engineering students a selection of practices and tools used by  researchers
              in engineering and science to deal with large systems.   Each selection will be
              designed as a module consisting of  handbooks, simulations,demonstrations,
              software systems, and  specifications of experiments.  Each module will be
              developed by an  interdisciplinary team of three faculty and one graduate
              student.   Each team's mix -- computer science, computational science and 
              informatics, and school of education -- will assure that the source 
              discipline's thinking will be part of the module.  The proposed  project will
              complement and leverage a major ARPA project dealing  with high performance
              computing in the curriculum.  The proposed  project will also complete a suite
              of initiatives undertaken by the  Computer Science Department at George Mason
              University to transform  undergraduate education.
