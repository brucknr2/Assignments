Abstract    :
              9315503  Monbouquette  An important goal of this project is to develop a
              laboratory  course in precompetitive microbial bioprocesses for senior 
              undergraduate and beginning graduate students.  An inter-  disciplinary team of
              faculty from the departments of Microbiology  and Molecular Genetics and
              Chemical Engineering well into the  academic curriculum recent progress in this
              field of fermentation  technology with emphasis on the newly developed
              technologies for  culturing microorganisms that grow under extreme
              environmental  conditions and bioprocesses related to these organisms.  The 
              development of this course will be undertaken in parallel with an  assessment
              of biochemical engineering/biotechnology laboratory  teaching efforts across
              the country.  A joint industry/academic  workshop is envisioned to evaluate the
              laboratory program.
