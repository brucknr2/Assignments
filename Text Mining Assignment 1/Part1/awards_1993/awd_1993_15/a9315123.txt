Abstract    :
              9315123  Damodaran  This project is on research to study  various aspects of
              protein  adsorption and film formation at  interfaces.  The main objectives 
              are: (1) to elucidate the role of  the electrochemical potential of  proteins
              in adsorption at the  air-water and silica-water  interfaces; (2) to
              investigate the  adsorption and film forming behavior  of magnetoferritin at
              these  interfaces; (3) to study the  molecular factors that govern  competitive
              and coadsorption of  proteins from solution; and (4) to  study the conformation
              of proteins  in situ at the air-water interface.   This research has potential 
              importance to: (1) understanding  protein stability; (2) the  development of
              information storage  devices; and (3) the production of  new chemicals by
              bioprocesses.  ***
