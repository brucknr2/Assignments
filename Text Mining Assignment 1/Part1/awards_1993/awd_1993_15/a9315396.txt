Abstract    :
              9315396  Fitch  This project is in the general area of analytical and surface
              chemistry  and focuses on the electrochemical investigation of the transport 
              properties of clays.  During the tenure of this three year continuing  grant,
              Professor Alanah Fitch and her students at Loyola University of  Chicago will
              use clay-modified electrodes to investigate the diffusion  of ions through well
              characterized clay layers.  The effects of pressure  and electrolyte
              concentration on the swelling and transport properties  of the clay materials
              will be examined.  Also, the influence of multiple  solutes on these properties
              will be explored to determine the extent of  cooperative or synergistic
              transport.  This experimental investigation  is designed to further our
              understanding of the soil-based transport of  typical pollutants, including
              both hydrophobic organic materials and  anionic radiochemicals, through clay
              containment beds.  %%%  This research is expected to provide an enhanced
              understanding of  several important processes which take place within the clay
              materials  that are used to line chemical waste disposal repositories.  Among
              the  issues to be explored are the effects of various toxic chemicals on the 
              characteristics of these clay materials, including their swelling and 
              transport properties.  The successful pursuit of the goals of this  project
              should enable more accurate prediction of the rates of escape of  pollutants
              from containment sites.  ***
