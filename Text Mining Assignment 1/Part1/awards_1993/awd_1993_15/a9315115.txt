Abstract    :
                  9315115  Hatzes  Although spots on the sun have been observed for nearly
              four  centuries and their behavior is well documented, it is extremely 
              difficult to study similar phenomena on other stars.  With support  from this
              grant the PI will continue to map the spots on a number  of stars using the
              technique known as Doppler imaging.  A new  spectrograph at McDonald
              Observatory will increase both the  quantity and quality of the data available
              and the program be  extended to take advantage of its capabilities. 
              Observations of  several stars which have been studied for a number of years
              will  continue to determine whether spots migrate in latitude (as in the  sun).
               Observations of a larger sample of spotted stars will be  used to determine
              the dependence of spot morphology on the  properties of the stars.  Studies of
              Ap stars will be continued  while T Tau stars and W UMa stars will be added to
              the program.     ***
