Abstract    :
              9315048  Brannon  We expect to improve the scientific understanding of the 
              origin of Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) ore deposits through  a broad
              geochemical study of ore-forming fluids.  We will  use isotopic information to
              provide constraints on the  provenance of ore-forming fluids and to provide
              direct  radiometric dating of ores and associated gangue minerals.  We will
              also use precise isotopic dilution analysis to  provide chemical
              characterization for several key elements.  fluid inclusions will be
              mechanically separated from host  minerals to allow more detailed
              characterization of these  components.  AN important part of this program is
              study of  the Rb-Sr system, which provides an  important isotopic  tracer in
              the 87Sr/86Sr  ratio as well as radiometric age  determinations.  The major
              sulfides ores are specifically  targeted for Rb-Sr analysis.  We will also use
              Pb isotopic  compositions as a geochemical tracer, studying not only the 
              minerals in which Pb is a major or accessory constituent but  also those in
              which it is a trace element.  Analyses of late-  stage calcites from several
              MVT districts in the  midcontinent of North America and detailed studies of the
               Pine Point district (Northwest Territories, Canada), the  Central Tennessee
              district, and the Reelfoot Rift, a  proposed fluid channel for MVT deposits in
              southeast  Missouri will be carried out.
