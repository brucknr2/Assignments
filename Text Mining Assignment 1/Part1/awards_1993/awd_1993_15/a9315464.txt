Abstract    :
              9315464  Sahney  This project is focused on the development and testing of  new
              decision-design technologies to support the continuous  improvement of clinical
              processes in the health care  delivery environment.  It is hypothesized that
              the quality  and cost-effectiveness of medical care can be improved 
              significantly through the use of quality improvement teams  comprised of
              physicians and non-physicians, armed with (1) a  limited amount of training in
              continuous quality improvement  (CQI) and clinical policy analytic concepts and
              methods, (2)  the support of a physician and/or non-physician with  additional
              training and dedicated time to devote to team-  related work, and (3) access to
              a specific set of  microcomputer-based decision-support tools.  The final 
              product of the project would be a decision-design technology  that could be
              used by quality improvement teams in clinical  process improvement projects.
