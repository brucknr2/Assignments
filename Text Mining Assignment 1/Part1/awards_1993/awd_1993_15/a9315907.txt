Abstract    :
              9315907  Nelson  This grant renewal will continue theoretical studies of the 
              electromagnetic response of crystals to external fields using a  Lagrangian
              approach.  Four topics will be explored.  (1) An  entirely new mathematical
              method of solving wave propagation  problems in bounded media will be studied. 
              This method operates in  wavevector space where there are no boundaries and so
              uses no  boundary conditions. (2) A new solution for the optical  reflectivity
              near an exciton resonance of a half-space of matter  will be studied.  (3) A
              macroscopic Lagrangian formulation of spin  using Grassmann algebra will be
              used to explore the properties of  magnetic media.  (4) Finally, research will
              be conducted on the  form of the electromagnetic energy flow vector in a
              material  medium.  %%%  The research proposed is in an area of solid state
              physics called  crystal physics.  A macroscopic approach is taken to determine
              the  effects of external magnetic and electric fields, and their  interactions,
              on the properties of crystals.  Thus, optical and  magnetic properties can be
              understood and new phenomena predicted.   These new phenomena can then be
              verified by experiment and studied  in more detail using more microscopic
              approaches.  In addition to  its fundamental interest, the work may be of
              importance to the  field of photonics.    ***
