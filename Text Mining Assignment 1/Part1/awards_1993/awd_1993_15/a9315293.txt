Abstract    :
                  9315293  Lande  The Homestake chlorine solar neutrino detector has monitored
              the  electron neutrino flux from the Sun for 22 years.  The observed  flux is
              30% of that predicted by the standard solar model.  This  result has perplexed
              solar astronomers for many years and the  explanation is still unknown.  The
              operation of the Homestake  chlorine detector will be continued for another
              three years so as  to overlap with new detectors being built or planned.  ***
