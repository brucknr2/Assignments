Abstract    :
                  9315455  Phinney  Several related studies in theoretical astrophysics will
              be  conducted.  One concerns interactions between members of binary  star
              systems which are caused by the fact that stars are neither  static nor
              elastic.  Mass transfer between an ordinary star and its  black hole or neutron
              star companion will be modeled to account for  observations of x-ray binaries
              and planets orbiting pulsars.  A  broad research program will be undertaken
              which is aimed at  understanding how stars may form in the densest nuclei of
              galaxies  and what these stars tell us about star formation.  ***
