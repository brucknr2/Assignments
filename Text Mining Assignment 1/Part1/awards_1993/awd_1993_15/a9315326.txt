Abstract    :
              9315326  Dubin    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor Paul Dubin,  Department of Chemistry, Indiana University- 
              Purdue University at Indianapolis, and  Professor Mikiharu Kamachi, Department
              of  Macromolecular Science, Osaka University, and  Professor Yotaro Morishima,
              Department of  Macromolecular Science, Osaka University.      The joint
              research focuses on the complex  formation between polyelectrolytes and 
              oppositely charged colloids of two types:  micelles and proteins.  In the
              former case,  there is particular interest in the critical  conditions for
              polyelectrolyte binding,  inasmuch as this system provides a unique test  of
              theories for polyelectrolyte adsorption.   The Osaka group has pioneered the
              use of dye-  labeled polyelectrolytes to probe the  electrostatic potential in
              the vicinity of the  polyion, and these will be used to establish  and
              understand the fundamental relationship  among colloid surface charge density,
              polyion  charge density and ionic strength at critical  binding conditions.   
              The second topic of investigation is  polyelectrolyte-protein complexation, an
              area  of considerable potential significance in bio-  separations and enzyme
              immobilization.  A key  question is the conformation of the protein in  the
              complex.  Fluorescence quenching methods  refined in Osaka will be used to
              answer this  question.  For both this system and the  polyelectrolyte-micelle
              system, transport  processes will be explored using dynamic and 
              electrophoretic light scattering in  Indianapolis and forced Rayleight
              scattering  and nanosecond fluorescence spectroscopy in  Osaka.  ***
