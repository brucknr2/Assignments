Abstract    :
              9315334  Rinehart    This award supports a U.S.-Japan Seminar on  Bioorganic
              Marine Chemistry, scheduled for July  1994 in Shizuoka, Japan.  The
              co-organizers are  Professor Kenneth Rinehart, Department of  Chemistry,
              University of Illinois, and Professor  Kazuo Tachibana, Department of
              Chemistry, Tokyo  University, Tokyo, Japan.  The seminar will focus  on (1)
              marine microorganisms as sources of drugs,  toxins, and biochemical agents, (2)
              isolation and  structure determination of bioactive compounds  from marine
              organisms, especially anticancer and  antiviral agents, (c) pharmacological
              evaluation  and mode of action of bioactive marine natural  products, and (d)
              marine chemical ecology.    The United States and Japan are world leaders in 
              marine bioorganic research.  This seminar will  provide an opportunity for
              scientists in the  field of chemistry, pharmacology, and  pharmacognosy from
              the two countries to exchange  information and develop research agendas for the
               future.  ***
