Abstract    :
              9315241  Hoover    This award supports collaboration between Douglas Hoover,
              Odyssey  Research Associates, Inc., Ithaca, New York, and Wang Ju,  Software
              Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China,  on simplification of
              generalized arithmetic formulas.  The US PI  will spend five months in China at
              the Software Institute working  with a group of Chinese mathematical logicians
              on applications of  logic to computer science, including theorem proving.  This
              will  be followed by a visit of two Chinese scientists to the US to  continue
              the work.    The proposed research falls in the area of theoretical computer 
              science, specifically automatic theorem proving.  The US PI and  his
              institution, ORA, are leading specialists in this are a of  research and the
              Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of  Software is the leading site for
              such research in China.  The  work proposed is necessary if automated reasoning
              techniques are  to become feasible tools for computer-aided design.  Once such 
              tools become practical, the effect on design will be potentially 
              revolutionary.
