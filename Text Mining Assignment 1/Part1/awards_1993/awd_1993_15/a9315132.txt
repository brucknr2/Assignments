Abstract    :
              9315132  Ginter    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor Marshall  Ginter, Institute for Physical Science and 
              Technology, University of Maryland, and Professor  Kojun Yamashita, Department
              of Physics, Nagoya  University.  The joint research involves the  development
              of next generation soft x-ray (SXR)  optical components and systems needed for
              such  critical areas as SXR projection lithography,  third-generation
              synchrotron radiation research,  space platform telescopes and spectrometers, 
              lithographic production of micro-machine parts,  microscopy, and nonsynchrotron
              radiation SXR  light sources.  The project also involves  Professor Howard
              Milchberg, University of  Maryland, Professor John McNeil, University of  New
              Mexico, and Japanese scientists at Tokyo  University, Osaka University, and
              Tohoku  University.      The research deals with various problems  associated
              with (1) optical and physical  properties of new SXR optical materials 
              (multilayers, etc.), (2) properties of new SXR  optical devices (imaging and
              projection system,  microscopes, telescopes, etc.), (3) evaluation  and testing
              of SXR optical elements (aspheric  surface figure, roughness, etc.), and (4) 
              improvement to intense laboratory (non-  synchrotron) SXR light sources.  The
              U.S. and  Japanese investigators' work is complementary and  the joint research
              will provide a unique  opportunity for mutually beneficial research.  ***
