Abstract    :
              9315041  Knuepfer       The active oblique arc-continent collision of the
              Eurasian and  Philippine Sea plates is well exposed in Taiwan.  This is a 
              geomorphic study of regional terraces and streams to determine  whether
              geomorphic domains change along and across strike and to  place the results in
              a tectonic context to address along and across  strike variations in the
              tectonic style and perhaps uplift rates.
