Abstract    :
              9315555  Novak    This awards supports the participation of ten  U.S. scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on  Inorganic-Organic Hybrid Materials, scheduled for 
              May 15-19, 1994 in Pacific Grove, CA.  The co-  organizers are Professor Bruce
              Novak, Department  of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley,  and
              Professor Hideki Sakurai, Department of  Chemistry, Tohoku University, Sendai,
              Japan.      The United States and Japan are two leading  countries in the field
              of inorganic-organic  hybrid materials.  This seminar is a follow on to  a 1991
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Inorganic and  Organometallic Polymers, which covered a
              wide  range of topics including polysilanes,  polyphosphazenes, boron
              containing polymers,  polysilazanes, and phthalocyanine-containing  polymers. 
              The 1994 seminar will focus on  inorganic-organic hybrid materials since they
              are  anticipated to play a key role in advancing  existing materials and in
              developing emerging  technologies.  Potential applications for hybrid 
              materials include optical, ceramic and ceramic  precursors, electronic
              materials, and biomedical  polymers.  The seminar will emphasize  preparation,
              characterization, and applications  of various polymers including
              inorganic-organic  interpenetrating networks, polyphosphazens,  polysilozanes,
              polysilanes, polysilazanes, and  polyborazines.    ***
