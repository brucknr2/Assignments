Abstract    :
              9315679  Ebron  This planning grant will provide support for planning the 
              development of an object-oriented simulator for automated  distribution
              systems, so that optimal automation strategies  can be selected for specific
              systems.  The simulator would  integrate load characteristics, feeder
              configuration,  automation strategies, and cost/benefit analyses into one 
              graphics-based simulation package.  For purposes of basic  research, it will
              allow general conclusions about automation  strategies to be made with respect
              to feeder type and load  characteristics.  ***
