Abstract    :
                     9315660  Stoler   This project involves the dissertation research of a
              cultural  anthropology student from the University of Michigan.  The  student
              will study the changes in Malaysian people's self  concepts of their ethnic
              identity caused by rapid urban  development.  Using methods of in-depth
              interviews and  participant-observation in an urban and in a rural community,
              the  student will interpret changing concepts of ethnic affiliation.     This
              research is important because the determinants of ethnic  affiliation are not
              fully understood.  In some cases people  identify as members of the national
              state or of the regional  community, and in others as members of localized
              ethnic groups.  Increased understand of how people conceptualize their ethnic 
              identity can help us understand and moderate ethnic conflicts  when they do
              occur.  ***
