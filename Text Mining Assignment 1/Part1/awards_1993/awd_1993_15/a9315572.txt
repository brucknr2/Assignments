Abstract    :
              9315572  Yannas  The inability of damaged or severed nerve axions to  reconnect
              following spinal cord injury causes paralysis, a  condition amenable to
              restorative treatment.  However, the  recent availability of chemical analysis
              of extracellular  matrices (ECM) has enhanced understanding of environmental 
              preferences of growing peripheral axons.  This in turn has  led to the
              fabrication of prostheses which have induced  rapid and almost complete
              recovery of function of transected  sciatic nerves in small rodents.    The
              goal of this research program is to synthesize,  characterize and optimize the
              composition and pore structure  of chemical analogs of ECM (based on graft
              copolymers of  type I collagen and chrondrotin 6-sulfate) that may  facilitate
              optimal elongation of spinal cord axions.  The  knowledge gained will be used
              to design implantable  prostheses that will facilitate reconnection of axons of
              the  spinal cord.  Support for clinical studies will be sought  from other
              sources.  This research, if successful, is  expected to improve the quality of
              life of individuals with  spinal cord injuries and effect a significant cost
              savings  in health care.    This program, supported under the Cost Effective
              Health Care  Technology Initiative, is a collaborative interdisciplinary 
              effort involving materials scientists and health care  practitioners from the
              Fibers and Polymers Laboratory as  well as the Department of Biology and Brain
              & Cognitive  Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the 
              Department of Neurosurgery @  Deaconess Hospital, and the  Orthopedics
              Laboratory @ Brigham and Women's Hospital.  ***
