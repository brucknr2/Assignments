Abstract    :
              9315694  Nazmy  This research project addresses the reinforcement of soil 
              excavations to resist earthquake shaking through the use of  soil nailing. 
              Soil nailing is an insitu soil reinforcement  technique that has been tested
              and implemented during the  past twenty years in a variety of civil engineering
               applications.  The fundamental concept consists of placing  in the ground
              passive inclusions (steel reinforcing bars)  as the excavation proceeds, in
              order to restrain  displacements, limit decompression during and after the 
              excavation, and to form a nailed mass that can behave  similarly to a soft
              retaining wall.    Post-earthquake field investigations and laboratory studies 
              have shown that soil-nailed structures are highly resistant  to earthquake
              loading.  However, to date, only limited  studies have been conducted to
              evaluate their response and  possible failure mechanisms under seismic loading.
               Such  research is needed to develop reliable design  methodologies. Given the
              increasing popularity of soil  nailing, this research project will have
              considerable  impact on the geotechnical design and construction  industries.  
               This project involves numerical analyses, laboratory  experiments -- in which
              a geotechnical centrifuge is used to  subject small-scale models to horizontal
              shaking -- and post  earthquake observations.  This integrated approach
              provides  a thorough understanding of the seismic response of soil  nailed
              systems, and will result in specific engineering  guidelines for their seismic
              design.    This is a collaborative project involving the University of 
              California at Los Angeles and the Polytechnic University,  New York, with the
              experiments being performed on the  geotechnical centrifuge at Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute.
