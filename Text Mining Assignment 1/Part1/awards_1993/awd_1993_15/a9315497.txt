Abstract    :
              9315497  Bashein  This is a planning project to develop methods to improve the 
              prediction of the time required to perform elective surgical  operations.  The
              goal is to change the present system which  is based on outright guesses or
              historical averages of times  to perform similar procedures.  Hypotheses to be
              tested are:  that a predictive model based on historical data and the 
              surgeon's time estimate will predict more accurately than  either of the
              factors alone; even with little historical  data or surgeon experience for a
              particular operation it  will be possible to improve the surgeon's time
              estimate;  and, a useful measure of the level of precision associated  with a
              predicted operating time can also be made from the  surgeon's estimate of the
              variability of his/her time  estimate and the available historical data.  This
              planning  project is to delineate the longer-term goals to develop an  improved
              method for scheduling elective operations and to  evaluate the method in actual
              practice, preferably at more  than one institution.  ***
