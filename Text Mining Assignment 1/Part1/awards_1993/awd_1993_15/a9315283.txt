Abstract    :
              9315283  Graves  This proposal focuses on the development of a modular
              laboratory  course in biotechnology and biochemical engineering.  These modules
               will be developed in collaboration with 12 universities which  constitute a
              group called, "The Middle-Atlantic Biochemical  Engineering Consortium
              (MABEC)".  A set of modular experiments will  be developed and written up as a
              publishable laboratory workbook.   A model laboratory will be designed to
              accompany the set of  experiments, and individual items of equipment needed
              will be keyed  to each experiment.  An integrated computer system will provide 
              data acquisition, control, and analysis functions.  Dissemination  will be
              carried out by video taping and publishing a manual.
