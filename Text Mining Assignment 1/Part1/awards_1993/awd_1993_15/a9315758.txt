Abstract    :
              9315758  Geskin       High pressure waterjet machining is extensively used in
              the  cutting of non-metallic materials.  While abrasive particles can be  added
              to the jet to machine metallic materials, such modification  reduces the life
              of the nozzle and associated equipment and the  beam diameter typically
              increases.  The project is to investigate  the feasibility of modifying the
              high pressure waterjet machining  process to transform the water microdroplets
              into ice.  It is  expected that such a modification will significantly increase
               machining rates to a range somewhere between that of conventional  waterjets
              and that of abrasive waterjets.  It is also expected that  the beam diameter
              can be significantly smaller than that of  conventional abrasive waterjets,
              increasing the resolution of the  operation.       Ice jets may allow materials
              to be cut more quickly and with  better accuracy, allowing the high pressure
              waterjet process to  find new industrial applications.
