Abstract    :
                9315967  Winkler    Supernova remnants provide information on the late stages
              of  stellar evolution, the interstellar medium and the chemical  evolution of
              galaxies.  Often these remnants can be better observed  in other nearby
              galaxies than in our own galaxy.  For this reason  several galaxies will be
              searched for more remnants.  Detailed  observations of known remnants in the
              Milky Way Galaxy will also be  made.  The PI has conducted photometric
              monitoring of light curves  of supernovas in collaboration with astronomers at
              other colleges.   This will be continued.  Undergraduate students will be
              involved in  all aspects of this work.  ***
