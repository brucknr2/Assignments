Abstract    :
              9315333  Chu    This award supports the participation of 12 U.S.  scientists in
              a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Quantum  Electronic Devices and States of Matter, 
              scheduled for August 1994 in Napa, California.   The co-organizers are
              Professor Steven Chu,  Department of Physics, Stanford University, and 
              Professor Tsutomu Yabuzaki, Department of  Physics, Kyoto University.  In
              addition to  participants from the United States and Japan,  scientists from
              France and Germany will attend  the meeting.    Research developments in
              atomic, molecular, and  optical (AMO) physics continues to develop at a  rapid
              pace.  In particular, newly developed  techniques to control and manipulate
              particles  such as atoms, ions, and micron sized particles  have caused much
              excitement both in the AMO  community and beyond.  These developments are 
              enabling the design and construction of a host of  fundamentally new
              instruments capable of  unprecedented sensitivity.  At the same time, the 
              methods are being used to study fundamental  interactions between matter and
              light, the  creation of new states of matter such as ionic  crystals, and
              better insights into the quantum  nature of the physical world.  The theme of
              the  meeting is the development of new quantum  electronic devices based on new
              understanding of  light/matter interactions and the application of  new AMO
              techniques to the creation of new states  of matter.  The seminar will
              emphasize the  interplay between basic research and the creation  of new
              devices and scientific instruments.  ***
