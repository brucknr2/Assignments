Abstract    :
              Waterbury  9315895    Previous  studies  by this investigator have confirmed 
              that  the  presence of a diverse group of marine cyanobacterial phages  that 
              are capable of infecting Synechococcus and that they can occur at  extremely
              high titers of 104 phage particles per milliliter.   In  addition, Waterbury
              has shown that a natural bacterial population  and  its  phages follow the
              patterns predicted from modeling  and  chemostat  studies  of  E. coli and its
              virulent  phages.   Thus,  Waterbury hypothesizes that due to the acquisition
              of resistance,  virulent   Synechococcus  phages  play  an  important   role  
              in  determining  the  clonal  composition  of  natural  Synechococcus 
              populations,  but  that they have little effect  on  the  overall  population 
              densities or mortality.  To test this  hypothesis,  a  laboratory  project is
              designed to develop ribonucleic  acid  and  antibody  probes to follow the
              species dynamics of  Synechococcus  and  its  phages,  respectively. This
              host-parasite  system  will  prove   to  be  an  excellent  model  to  examine 
              the  role   of  bacteriophages in the oceans.  ***
