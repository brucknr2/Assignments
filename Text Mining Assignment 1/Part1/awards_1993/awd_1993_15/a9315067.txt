Abstract    :
                9315067  Herbst  The PI will continue to use the 0.6 m Perkin reflecting
              telescope  and CCD camera at Van Vleck Observatory to monitor supernova 
              eruptions.  The goal is to obtain high quality, well sampled light  curves of
              all the supernovae which are sufficiently far north and  sufficiently bright
              for this instrument.  These data will be useful  in determining the degree to
              which type Ia supernovae can be  regarded as photometrically homogeneous,
              determining the  photometric parameters of types Ia and II supernovae and 
              establishing the properties and frequency of occurrence of various  types of
              supernovae light curves.  Undergraduate students will be  heavily involved in
              this project.    ***
