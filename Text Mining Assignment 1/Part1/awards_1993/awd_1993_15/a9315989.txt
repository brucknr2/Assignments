Abstract    :
              9315989  Grove  The focus of the research is the use of intramolecular trapping 
              of cobalt-stabilized propargyl cations to construct key 
              cis-ethynyloctahydrophenanthrene intermediates.  The D-ring  will then be
              appended using an iminyl radical cyclization.  The  resultant advanced
              intermediate has the potential of providing  a wide variety of N-substituted
              morphinans.  The route is  amenable to the preparation of optically active
              compounds and  the methodology should provide information as to the scope and 
              limitations of the intramolecular Nicholas reaction.  %%%  With this Research
              in Undergraduate Institutions award, the  Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the research of Dr.  David D. Grove of the Department of Chemistry
              at Eckard  College.  Professor Grove will focus his work on the  development of
              new syntheses of important compounds, the  morphinans, which are related to the
              widely used analgesic,  morphine.  His research will be carried out with the
              aid of  undergraduate colleagues.  ***
