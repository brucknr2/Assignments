Abstract    :
              9315773  Lau    This research addresses fundamental materials science issues 
              surrounding the concept of utilizing the photoelastic effect for  control and
              stabilization of stresses in metallic stressor films,  which can also serve as
              electrodes.  The objectives are to  introduce controllable and stable strains
              into semiconductor  systems by means of metal-semiconductor and metal-metal 
              reactions, and to provide the materials science basis for  tailoring films to
              make wave guides on binary and ternary  substrates such as InP, GaAs, and
              GaInAs. Two approaches are  being pursued:  (l) Introduction of stable strain
              by  metal-substrate reactions. This approach relies on the volume  change in
              the structure due to the reaction between the metallic  stressor layer and the
              substrate; the reaction product is also  metallic in conductivity; (2)
              Introduction of strain by  metal-metal interactions.  The stressor is formed by
              reacting two  deposited metallic layers on the substrate to form a strained 
              epitaxial layer.  These approaches and the basic studies of  materials science
              issues associated with the chemical and  physical processes are expected to
              provide the basis for  simplifying and improving planarized photonic devices. 
              %%%  Light guiding is commonly experienced when we shine light onto a  stream
              of water and observe that the light follows the water  stream.  This phenomenon
              is very important for high speed and  large volume communication.  This project
              investigates innovative  and efficient ways to make improved and simplified
              lightguides in  the basic materials used in telecommunications, information 
              processing, and computing.
