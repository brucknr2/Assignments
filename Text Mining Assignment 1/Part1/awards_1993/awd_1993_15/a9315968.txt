Abstract    :
                9315968  Bouldin    Description:  This project supports  participation of U.S.
              scientists in a conference  in Calcutta, India: The VLSI Design'94, 
              January5-8, 1994.  The Indian chairman is P. Pai  Chaudhuri, of the Department
              of Computer Science  and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, 
              Kharagpur.  The conference is a forum for  researchers and designers to present
              and discuss  various aspects of this emerging field.  Topics  of interest
              include: analog devices, application  specific devices, CAE/CAD systems, DSP 
              applications, design for testability, economic  issues, fault modeling and
              simulation, fault  tolerant computing, high level synthesis, logic  and circuit
              simulation, logic synthesis,  microarchitecture, mixed A/D VLSI, multi-chip 
              modules, placement and routing, regional/global  perspectives, technology CAD,
              test generation,  timing verification, VLSI architectures and  algorithms, and
              VLSI neural networks.    Scope:  This is the seventh such conference held  in
              India starting with 1985 in Madras, and then  in Bangalore, New Delhi and
              Bombay.  These  meetings were open to scientists from the  developing
              countries, and were also well  attended by scientists from Europe, Japan, and 
              North America.  It is expected that the 1994  conference also will be well
              attended.  The U.S.  Principal Investigator, Dr. Donald Bouldin will  prepare a
              summary report on the highlights of  the conference, to be published in the
              IEEE  Circuits & Devices Magazine.  ***
