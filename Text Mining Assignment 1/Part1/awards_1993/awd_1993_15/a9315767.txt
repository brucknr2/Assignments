Abstract    :
              9315767  Pyrak-Nolte      The PI will investigate on the laboratory time scale
              active seismic monitoring of fractures or interfaces undergoing frictional
              sliding and stick-slip behavior.  Active seismic monitoring involves
              propagating compressional/shear waves across interfaces under shear loading. 
              Results from this work on the laboratory scale should illuminate one of the key
              questions of earthquake prediction and joint stability.  In order to achieve
              this objective, two critical issues will be addressed: (1) the observation of
              changes in seismic amplitudes or velocities as a fracture undergoes frictional
              sliding and stick-slip behavior, and (2) relating seismic precursors to the
              surface conditions of the fracture.  ****
