Abstract    :
              9315695  Kirkpatrick  This research will investigate the local atomic structural
               environments and dynamical behavior of minerals and model  compounds
              undergoing structural phase transitions (SPTs) and  of exchangeable organic and
              inorganic cations and molecules  in clays and a zeolite.  The work will take
              advantage of the  unique capabilities of nuclear magnetic resonance 
              spectroscopy (NMR) to probe phenomena occurring at low  frequencies in the
              hertz to 100 MHz range.  Specific  projects to be undertaken include
              examination of: (1)  structural phase transitions of SiO2- and
              AlPO4-tridymites,  (2)  a variety of exchangeable inorganic cations and organic
               cations and molecules in several important clay minerals,  and (3)  Na in the
              prototypical small-pore zeolite analcime.  The clay study should elucidate the
              behavior of specific  chemical species in both natural and polluted
              near-surface  geochemical environments.
