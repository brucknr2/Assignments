Abstract    :
              9315779  Kieffer    The investigation of visco-elastic relaxations in fragile
              glass  forming liquids, using a combination of Brillouin light scattering, 
              molecular dynamic computer simulations and impedance spectroscopy  is proposed.
                 The objective of the research is to provide improved understanding  with
              respect to the factors that determine the glass formation  ability and the
              temperature dependence of the viscosity in novel  glassy materials, e.g.
              tellurites, heavy metal fluorides and  phosphates.  The principal aspects of
              this study will be to  explore:  (1) The role of different network cations. 
              (2) The  stabilizing effect of counter cations.  (3) The effect of mixed  anion
              compositions on the network structure and the associated  degree of decoupling
              between mobile cations and the network.        (4) The influence of impurities
              and the possible characterization  of defects.  ***
