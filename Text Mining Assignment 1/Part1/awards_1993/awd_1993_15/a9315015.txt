Abstract    :
              9315015  Bailey-Serres  Protein synthesis is a multi-step process that is
              regulated at  numerous levels in maize as well as in all other organisms.  The 
              hypoxic (low-oxygen) stress response of seedling roots involves the  rapid
              inhibition of initiation, followed by selective initiation  and elongation of
              mRNA translation.  The hypoxic stress response  provides a model for studying
              modulation of protein synthesis under  low energy conditions.  This project
              focuses on modifications of  acidic ribosomal proteins (ARPs) in response to
              hypoxia.  Three  acidic-phosphorylated proteins, known as P0, P1 and P2, are
              present  as a multimeric structure in the active site of the ribosome where 
              interactions between mRNA, tRNA and translation factors occur  during the
              late-initiation, elongation and termination phases of  translation.  The
              biochemical objectives are to identify P0, P1 and  P2 of maize, analyze the
              stoichiometry of the three-types of ARPs  in monoribosomes and polyribosomes of
              aerobic and hypoxic roots,  characterize the in vivo phosphorylation of ARPs
              under control and  hypoxic conditions, and analyze other modifications of ARPs
              in  response to hypoxia.  The molecular objectives are to identify and 
              sequence the genes encoding the ARPs of maize, and to initiate  site-directed
              mutagenesis of the phosphorylation sites of the ARPs  genes.  The long-term
              goal is to test the role of ARP modification  in an in vitro translation system
              from maize root tips.  These  experiments will provide the foundation for the
              elucidation of  ribosome structure-function relationships in mechanisms of
              protein  synthesis in higher plants.  This project involves a collaboration 
              with Dr. Estela Sanchez de Jimenez at National Autonomous  University of
              Mexico, Mexico City.  ***
