Abstract    :
              9315920  McPhee  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program 
              ("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the
              eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B.
              Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here is an effort to
              define the vertical and horizontal  thermohaline fluxes within the eastern part
              of the Weddell Gyre.   Specifically, instrument clusters capable of measuring
              the Reynolds  stress and the turbulent heat flux directly will be suspended
              from  the sea ice near the ship for two separate fifteen day drift  periods. 
              Also, microconductivity sensors at three levels in the  water will provide the
              directly measured salinity flux, and a  number of thermistor strings frozen in
              the ice will measure the  heat conduction within the ice and the ice mass
              balance.    These measurements, in conjunction with other concurrent 
              experiments to quantify the energy brought to the underside of the  ice, will
              form the basis of a regional study of the processes  responsible for the
              relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin ice  cover.  It is believed that
              these conditions are only marginally  stable, and are maintained by a
              relatively high upward heat flux,  which, if interrupted, could lead to deep
              vertical convection, and  a significant change in the oceanic climate.  ***
