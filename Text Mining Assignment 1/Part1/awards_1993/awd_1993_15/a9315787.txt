Abstract    :
              9315787  Schuster      The Pis will develop a new radar inversion method for
              extracting the sub-surface conductivity  and dielectric distribution from
              transient radar data.  The radar experimental geometries will be  both the
              surface source receiver configuration and the crosswell configuration (i.e.,
              radar sources  in one well and electromagnetic receivers in an adjacent well). 
              The first step of this new  method, denoted as Maxwell Equation Tomography or
              MET is the computation of radar  electrograms by finite-difference solution to
              the full 2-D or 2.5-D Maxwell's equations.  The  second step is to compute both
              a radargram waveform misfit function and a first arrival  traveltime misfit
              function.
