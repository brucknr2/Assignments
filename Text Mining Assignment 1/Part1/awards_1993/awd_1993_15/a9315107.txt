Abstract    :
              9315107  Hrivnak    While most phases in the evolution of low and medium mass
              stars are  well documented, the transition from red giants to planetary 
              nebulae remains poorly observed.  This results from the briefness  of this
              stage, the fact that the stars are often obscured in dust  and the difficulty
              of identifying such objects.  Fifty-five  candidates have now been identified
              and will be observed to verify  their status and determine their properties.
