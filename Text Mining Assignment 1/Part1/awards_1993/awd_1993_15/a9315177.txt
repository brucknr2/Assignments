Abstract    :
              9315177  Osburn  This award of $180,000 is for curriculum development in
              microsensor  and biosensor engineering.  The goal is to bring together teams of
               researchers from two existing engineering research centers to  develop
              academic courses in microsensor and biosensor engineering.   Two
              semester-length courses will be developed by a curriculum  committee of
              academic researchers, assisted by an advisory  committee with broad
              interdisciplinary scientific specialties.  In  order to broaden their impact,
              disseminated of the courses to  universities in North Carolina will be effected
              using the state-  wide video network.  The courses will be accompanied by a new
               textbook and a series of laboratory experiments.
