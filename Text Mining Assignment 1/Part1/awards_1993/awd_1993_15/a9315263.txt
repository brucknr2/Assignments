Abstract    :
              9315263  Mills    This awards supports the participation of 10  U.S. scholars in
              a U.S.-Japan Seminar on The  State of Teaching Japanese to Scientists and 
              Engineers, scheduled for May 1994 in  Pittsburgh, PA.  The co-organizers of the
               seminar are Professor David Mills, Department  of East Asian Language and
              Literature,  University of Pittsburgh, and Professor Kazuo  Otsubo, Director of
              Japanese Language Teaching,  Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.    The objective
              of the seminar is to strengthen  the infrastructure of science in the United 
              States by leading to improved methods of  teaching technical Japanese to U.S.
              scientists  and engineers, thus enabling a greater level of  collaboration with
              their Japanese colleagues.   The seminar will focus on a review of existing 
              programs, discussion of pedagogical issues, and  consideration of what
              directions are the most  fruitful for the future.  Also, the seminar  will
              examine ways to foster better cooperation  between scientists and engineers on
              the one  hand and Japanese language specialists on the  other.  One further
              goal is to establish  relationships that may lead to enhanced  opportunities
              for U.S. students to spend time  in Japan mastering the language in an 
              appropriate scientific setting.    ***
