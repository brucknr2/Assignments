Abstract    :
                9315461  Winget  Over the past seven years the PI and his collaborators have 
              developed a worldwide network of cooperating observers, dubbed the  Whole Earth
              Telescope or WET, to obtain uninterrupted time-series  measurements of variable
              white dwarfs and related stars.  This  allows the determination of the numerous
              oscillation frequencies  exhibited by these stars.  These frequencies strongly
              constrain  models of white dwarfs and the implications include the evolution 
              of these stars, the application of white dwarfs to the study of the  history of
              the galaxy and the physics of materials at extreme  densities and temperatures.
               The study of materials under extreme  conditions has applications in a variety
              of areas of science and  technology.  ***
