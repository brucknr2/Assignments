Abstract    :
              9315061  Wolf    The knowledge of many basic stellar properties is dependent on 
              studies of variable stars.  Two classes of variable stars,  eclipsing binaries
              and yellow supergiants will be studied in this  project.  Photometry
              measurements will be made with CCD on the  Baker Observatory 0.4 meter
              telescope at Southwestern Missouri  State University.  Light curves will be
              obtained for poorly studied  eclipsing binaries and eclipses sought in
              suspected eclipsing  binaries.  Many yellow supergiants may vary at low levels
              and a  sample of these stars will be observed to search for such  variations.
