Abstract    :
              9315368  Bahcall    This research will support work in cosmology, large-scale 
              structure, and clusters of galaxies.  The goal of the  research is the
              determination of the structure in the  universe and the discrimination among
              various cosmological  models.  They will perform analyses of observational
              data,  and use some of the largest cosmological model simulations  available to
              date to address the following topics:    (1)  Investigate the large-scale
              structure in the universe  using galaxy clusters, superclusters, quasars, radio
               galaxies, and pencil-beam surveys as tracers, and integrate  the results into
              a unified picture;    (2) Use large-scale computer simulations of cosmological 
              models to compare the observations with predictions from  different models;
              and,    (3) Study the detailed properties--in optical, X-ray, and 
              optical-to-X-ray cross-correlations of clusters of galaxies,  the largest bound
              systems known.  Implications regarding the  cluster potential and dark-matter
              distribution, galaxy and  hot gas distribution, velocity bias, and the nature
              of the  intracluster medium will be derived and compared with  cosmological
              simulations.    The observational analysis and modeling will clarify the 
              nature of galaxy clusters and of larger scale structure and  constrain
              cosmological models.  The Principal Investigator  and her collaborators have
              successfully worked in these  fields and are regarded as highly experienced in
              these  research areas.  ***
