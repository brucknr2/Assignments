Abstract    :
                9315485  Danchi  Many luminous red giant stars eject significant amounts of
              material  from their outer layers.  This culminates with the star rapidly 
              becoming a white dwarf.  Our knowledge of the mechanism by which  the mass is
              ejected is limited.  The conditions in the close  vicinity of such stars will
              be studied.  The Berkeley Infrared  Spatial Interferometer will be used to
              determine the distribution  of warm dust in the regions where the ejection is
              taking place.   Speckle interferometry and VLBA observations will also be
              carried  out.  A primary goal is to relate the variations of the stars to  the
              structure of the ejected dust shell and thus shed light on the  ejection
              mechanism.  ***
