Abstract    :
              9315449  Payne  This project is to examine a non-capital-intensive enzymatic 
              approach for selectively and efficiently removing phenolic  contaminants from
              intermediate chemical process streams.  The  approach involves two steps in
              which phenol is first converted to  its quinone by the enzyme tyrosinase.  The
              quinone is then  adsorbed to a chitosin adsorbent through strong covalent 
              interactions.  The advantage of this approach is due to the  substrate
              specificity of tyrosinase for phenol, and the strength  of the quinone-chitosin
              adsorption.  This process is thought to  be readily adaptable to existing
              manufacturing operations for  specialty and commodity chemicals.  ***
