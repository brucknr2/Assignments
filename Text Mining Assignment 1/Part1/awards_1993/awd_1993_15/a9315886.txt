Abstract    :
              9315886  Durand  This award will fund a project to investigate parameter 
              estimation techniques for use with neurophysiological  systems.  The
              investigators will compare and test current  and new parameter estimation
              techniques; that is, Linear  Associative Memories. These techniques will be
              applied to  the estimation of electrotonic and membrane ionic channel 
              parameters.    This proposal was submitted to the Biosystems Analysis and 
              Control Initiative which encouraged the submission of  proposals that through
              the study of neurophysiological  systems could advance engineering science and
              advance the  knowledge of biological systems through the use of  engineering
              analysis techniques.  The research being funded  by this award has the
              potential to assist in the modeling of  neurophysiological data and advance the
              field of engineering  in the area of parameter estimation.  ***
