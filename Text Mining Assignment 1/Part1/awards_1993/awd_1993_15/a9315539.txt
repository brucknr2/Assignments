Abstract    :
              9315539  Evans  The goal of this project is to combine insights in the new field
              of  Interfacial Engineering with the advances in instructional  technology and
              cognitive learning theory to create a broadly  relevant curriculum.  Based on
              existing research in interfacial  science and engineering, 8 multimedia
              computer-based instructional  modules will be developed in two years.  The
              effectiveness and  utility of these modules in multi-disciplinary curricula
              will be  similarly evaluated at the University of Minnesota, and at Case 
              Western Reserve, Clarkson, Purdue, Rice, Stanford, UCLA, University  of
              Virginia, and University of Washington.  After test, evaluation  and
              refinement, the individual modules in CD-ROM will be introduced  nationwide
              through the conferences and Symposia on higher  education.
