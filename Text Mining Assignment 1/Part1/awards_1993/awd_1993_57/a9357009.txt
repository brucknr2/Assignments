Abstract    :
              9357009  Simon  Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are important regulatory
              molecules  that control many aspects of cellular growth, differentiation and 
              metabolism.  This work is directed toward understanding the  mechanisms by
              which these proteins, particularly those which span  the plasma membrane and
              are controlled by extracellular ligands,  regulate intracellular events.  The
              PI has focused his studies on  the action of a particular transmembrane PTK
              that is encoded by the  sevenless gene of Drosphilia melanogaster.  Mutations
              that  inactivate the sevenless protein (Sev) lead to a single known  defect in
              the fly.  Seven Enhancer of sevenless loci were  identified.  Mutations in four
              of the Enhancer of sevenless loci  also affect signaling by other receptor
              PTKs.  The PI has  concentrated on the analysis of these four loci in hopes
              that they  would encode components of a general PTK signaling pathway.  One 
              locus, Ras1, encodes a ras protein.  ras proteins are known to be  molecular
              switches that control many aspects of cellular activity.   How Ras1 is
              activated has therefore become the crucial question  which will be a major
              focus of this work.  %%%  This work explores a complex signal transduction
              system that  functions in cellular and organizational development and growth 
              control.  Since the components of this system are highly conserved  during
              evolution, it is likely that this knowledge gained will  apply to all PTK
              signalling systems.
