Abstract    :
              9357199  Jarrell  This is a NSF Young Investigator Award which will
              theoretically  study strongly correlated electronic materials including heavy 
              Fermion, magnetic and high temperature superconducting materials.   Besides the
              usual analytic many-body techniques, quantum Monte  Carlo simulations will be
              combined with perturbation theory so that  the computationally intensive Monte
              Carlo is used only for the non-  perturbative part of the problem.  %%%  ***
