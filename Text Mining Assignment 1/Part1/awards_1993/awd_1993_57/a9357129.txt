Abstract    :
              This study in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                      
              Program of the Chemistry Division is supported through the NSF                 
              Young Investigator Awards Program and involves the formulation                 
              and implementation of new electronic structure methods for                     
              calculating electronically excited states for both molecules                   
              and gas-surface systems.  Further, connections are being sought                
              to dynamical theories to allow first-principles predictions of                 
              energy flow in, and the chemical reactivity of, such excited                   
              states.

              In this study supported by the NSF Young Investigator Awards                   
              Program new theoretical and computational methods are being                    
              developed for describing the excited electronic states and the                 
              chemical reactivity of molecules in the gas phase or on                        
              surfaces.
