Abstract    :
               An important goal in software engineering is to describe  complex software
              systems at an architectural level of  abstraction.  While  architectural design
              has always been a  major factor in determining the success   of a software
              system,  architectural descriptions are typically understood only   in 
              informal, idiomatic ways.  Because of this informality  architectural   designs
              are typically not well-integrated into  the software development  
              environments, but appear (if at all)  as corroborative high-level documentation
                for a system.    This research places architectural design on a more solid  
              footing in two complementary ways.  First, it provides a  formal basis for  
              describing and reasoning about architectural  designs.  This leads to rules  
              for checking whether  architectural designs are well-formed in a way that is  
              analogous  to type checking for existing implementation languages.   Second, it
                provides tools for developing style-specific  architectural design  
              environments.  These tools provide  cost-effective ways to generate new  
              environments tailored to  the architectural design of specific application  
              families.      This grant includes support under the Research Experiences   for
