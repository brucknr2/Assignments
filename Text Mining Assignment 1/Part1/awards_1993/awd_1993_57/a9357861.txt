Abstract    :
              9357861  Zank       This new National Science Foundation Young investigator will
               develop a basic understanding of the complex, non-linear  interactions between
              fully developed small-scale turbulence and  large scale compressible and
              apparently "laminar" phenomena by  investigating a series of relevant,
              well-posed and important  problems in solar, space, and astrophysics.  ***
