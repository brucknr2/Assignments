Abstract    :
              9357507  Shen  This is a New Young Investigator Award for research in condensed 
              matter physics using electron spectroscopy techniques.  These  techniques
              represent a powerful tool to study magnetic 3d and 4f  electrons in atoms in
              magnetic and superconducting materials.  This  research will mainly involve
              spin-polarized appearance potential  spectroscopy and spin-polarized inverse
              photoemission spectroscopy.   These techniques will be used to study magnetic
              and other  materials, particularly thin films and multilayers.  These studies 
              will be complimented by high-resolution photoemission and other  experimental
              techniques.  %%%  This New Young Investigator Award will support research to
              develop  an advanced magnetic materials characterization technique and will  be
              carried out in close collaboration with scientists from IBM who  have provided
              most of the equipment needed for the project.  This  technique is currently
              unique in the US and has potential to  provide fundamental information about
              the materials properties of  magnetic thin films and multilayers.  These
              properties are  important for applications of these materials as sensors and as
               magnetic storage media.  ***
