Abstract    :
               The goal of this research is to investigate and develop  techniques needed to
              produce a tool that allows the  applications programmer and computer designer
              to work   to increase uniprocessor performance.  Computational units,  such as
              the floating-point units, are becoming faster and  readily available because of
              the rapid advances in technology  and computer-aided design (CAD) tools.  The
              performance,  however, is limited by the rate at which data is applied to  the
              units.  To achieve good uniprocessor performance,  the computational units,
              memory, and  memory ports  must be efficiently utilized.  This may require 
              that the applications programmer redesign the algorithms to better exploit the 
              unique features of the architecture or the computer designer  utilize CAD tools
              to design special-purpose processors that  exploit the unique features of the
              algorithms or for best  results, both.  This research investigates and
              develops: (1)  techniques for extracting statistics on the utilization of the 
              aforementioned processor resources, and (2) methods for  displaying the
              performance statistics to benefit both the  applications programmer and the
              computer designer.  The  results of this research permit the applications 
              programmer and computer designer to interact closely to  address the problem of
              efficiently solving challenging  problems such as climate modeling, vehicle
              dynamics,  semiconductor modeling, and quantum chromodynamics, which are 
              beyond the scope of existing computers.
