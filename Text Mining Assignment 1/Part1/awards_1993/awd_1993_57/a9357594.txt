Abstract    :
              The  PI  is  developing a multi-sensor environment  for  precise,  calibrated 
              vision  experiments, controlling imaging  optics  and  sensor  parameters to
              facilitate quick, accurate  measurement  of  factors such as scene brightness,
              color, and illlumination.  This  environment  is  used  to develop and test  a 
              series  of  vision  sensors  and  recovery algorithms based on a variety of 
              physical  models.   The ultimate goal is an integrated vision system  based  on
                a   single   computational  framework  for  general   visual  perception, 
              with enhanced capabilities due to the  incorporation  of  information  about 
              physical  principles.   The  PI  is  also  developing  a  comprehensive 
              curriculum  for  undergraduate  and  graduate  education  in computer vision,
              incorporating  an  image  library,  research-based visual aids for  concept 
              demonstration,  and  interactive software for hands-on experience  in 
              processing  real images.
