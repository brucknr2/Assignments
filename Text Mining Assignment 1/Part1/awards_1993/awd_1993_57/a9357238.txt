Abstract    :
              9357238  Rogers       This NYI award will support the research of a promising 
              and accomplished young investigator.  His research will  include an
              experimental study of interactions between  electrons and electromagnetic
              fields in high energy colliders.   This will include such processes as beam
              environment and beam-  beam dynamics, and the generation of coherent high
              energy  photon beams.  ***
