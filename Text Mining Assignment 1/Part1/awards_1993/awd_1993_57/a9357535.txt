Abstract    :
              9357535  Pelz  Microscopic electronic and structural phenomena at surfaces and 
              interfaces will be studied, primarily using STM-related  techniques. Planned
              work includes: (1) study of atomic surface  motions during oxidation reactions
              at elevated temperatures, (2)  local electronic properties of dislocations in
              semiconductor  heterostructures, and (3) local electron injection into thin 
              films of insulating materials.    ***
