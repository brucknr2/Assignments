Abstract    :
               Constraints  are  ubiquitous in many application areas  including  operations 
              research  (packing and scheduling),  hardware  design  (circuit  
              verification),  computational  linguistics,   computer  graphics,  and 
              software  engineering.  Constraint   programming  languages  hold the  promise
              of reducing the development  time  of  these  applications  significantly,
              while preserving a  reasonable  efficiency.  The  purpose of this  project to 
              study  the  design,  implementation,   and  applications  of  constraint  
              programming  languages. Both applicative and object-oriented  languages are
              considered.  Design  issues focus on  how  best  to  support  established   
              paradigms   for   the   applications   considered.  Implementation research
              considers the design of algorithms  for  constraint  solving, entailment, and
              generalization for a  variety  of  constraint  systems.  It  also  investigates
              the  static  analysis  of  constraint  programming  languages  to  reduce  the 
              performance   gap   between   procedural   and  constraint-based  languages,
              leading to the development of optimizing compilers  for  a variety of
              languages. Finally, applications validate  the  technology and implementation
              developed in the  project  and  demonstrate the  potential impact of the
              technology.
