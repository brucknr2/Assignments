Abstract    :
                   9357392  Woodward    The proposed NYI research initiative is two-fold:  1)
              development  of an infrared imaging spectrometer; and 2) use of this instrument
               in observational studies of the composition and physical/chemical  evolution
              of astrophysical dust in the interstellar medium.  This  research also will
              provide students with 'hands-on' laboratory  opportunities and serve as the
              basis for new course development in   advanced technologies.  Such experiences
              beyond the classroom are  often a key to motivating and encouraging students to
              pursue  undergraduate and advanced degrees in the sciences.  ***
