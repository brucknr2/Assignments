Abstract    :
                      9357245  Mason  This NSF Young Investigator award investigates the 
              interrelationships among natural products chemistry, behavioral  biology,
              reproductive physiology, and ecology.  This research uses  a comparative,
              interdisciplinary approach that combines and  integrates the molecular,
              organismal, and ecological levels of  analysis.  It is conducted both in the
              laboratory and in the field  to illustrate the adaptive functions of
              semiochemicals or  pheromones.  Field and laboratory studies are complementary,
               bridging the gap between natural products chemistry and behavioral  ecology by
              incorporating laboratory-based analyses of the  structure, manufacture, and
              delivery of semiochemicals with studies  of the animals's physiological ecology
              and behavior in the field.     Specifically, the research focuses on vertebrate
              sex pheromones.   Using state-of-the-art chemical techniques such as gas 
              chromatography/mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy,
              the principal investigator has isolated, identified,  and synthesized the first
              pheromone in a reptile, the Canadian red-  sided garter snake, Thamnophis
              sirtalis parietalis.  These studies  address the practical applications of this
              research.  Currently  rattlesnake repellent based on semiochemicals produced by
              other  snakes is being developed.  A second project is aimed at using 
              pheromones to help control populations of the Guam brown tree  snake, an
              introduced pest species that has destroyed most of the  native bird populations
              on Guam and threatens the ecology of other  Pacific Ocean islands, including
              Hawaii.  ***
