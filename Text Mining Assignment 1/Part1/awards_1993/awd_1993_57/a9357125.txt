Abstract    :
              Aromatic molecules (including aromatic heterocycles),                          
              complexed to metal ions via two carbon atoms, will be used                     
              to for regioselective activation of the aromatic ring,                         
              stereoselective addition of reagents to one ring face,                         
              regioselective protection of the olefinic binding site, and                    
              the application of these features to current synthetic                         
              targets. This methodology will be used to prepare                              
              epibatidine, a pyridyl-substituted 7-azabicycloheptane that                    
              has been shown to be a potent non-opioid analgesic. An                         
              osmium(II) complex will be used in these reactions. In a                       
              second phase of this research, alternative Re ion-based                        
              dearomatization agents will be developed. By varying the                       
              electronic and steric character of the metal center: (1) the                   
              affinity for aromatic ligands will be optimized, (2) a                         
              chiral coordination environment will be prepared for                           
              asymmetric induction, and (3) metal-aromatic bond strengths                    
              will be adjusted to facilitate a catalytic process.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Synthesis Program supports the                     
              work of Professor W. Dean Harman at the University of                          
              Virginia. Complexes of cyclic organic molecules will be                        
              prepared with certain metal ions that will be useful in the                    
              synthesis of intricate molecules, such as a potent analgesic                   
              that has non-opioid properties. Metal ion complexation will                    
              increase the reactivity of the cyclic organic compounds as                     
              well as direct the attack of another molecule to a                             
              particular atom or face of the cyclic organic molecule.                        
              These features of the metal ion-cyclic organic molecule                        
              complexes will allow for broad synthetic applications.
