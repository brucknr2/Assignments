Abstract    :
              9357444  Hsu  This is a New Young Investigator Award for materials physics 
              research focusing on problems at the mesoscopic scale (0.01 - 1 m).   The
              project will investigate how changes at this length scale  affect macroscopic
              behavior of a system.  Of particular interest is  the dependence of optical and
              electronic properties on structure  variations (such as order and disorder) and
              nearby defects.  The  research will employ scanning surface microscopies,
              particularly  the near-field scanning optical microscope.  The information is
              of  fundamental importance and has technical relevance in the context  of
              ultrasmall electronic devices.  %%%  This is a New Young Investigator Award for
              materials physics  problems at the mesoscopic scale (0.01 - 1 m), that is at
              the scale  where the physical dimensions of the system become similar to the 
              quantum size or wavelength of atomic substituents, particularly  electrons. 
              The project will investigate how changes at this length  scale affect
              macroscopic, large-scale behavior, such as the optical  and resistivity
              properties of the particles.  Of particular  interest is the dependence of
              optical and electronic properties on  structure variations (such as order and
              disorder) and nearby  defects.  The research will employ scanning surface
              microscopies,  particularly the near-field scanning optical microscope.  The 
              information is of fundamental importance and has technical  relevance in the
              context of ultrasmall electronic devices.  ***
