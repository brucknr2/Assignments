Abstract    :
              This NSF Young investigator award will investigate the role played  by the
              oceans in climate variations. Numerical and analytical  approaches will be used
              to study the air-sea interactions in the  seasonal cycle and the relation
              between the seasonal cycle and  interannual oscillations in the tropics.
              Transport processes of  deep equatorial waters will also be investigated
