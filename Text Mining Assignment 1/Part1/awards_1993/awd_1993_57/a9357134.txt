Abstract    :
              9357134  Ellman  The focus of this research is the simultaneous and
              combinatorial  synthesis of 1,4-benzodiazepines, prostaglandins and beta-turn 
              mimics using solid-phase synthetic methodology.  The resulting  compounds will
              then be screened against specific receptors or  enzymes to gain insight into
              structure versus recognition.  The  speed of the technique could revolutionize
              the ease of carrying  out such analyses.  %%%  With this NSF Young Investigator
              award, the Synthetic Organic  Program is supporting the research of Dr.
              Jonathan A. Ellman of  the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              California,  Berkeley.  Dr. Ellman will focus his work on the simultaneous  and
              combinatorial synthesis of libraries of important classes  of nonpolymeric
              organic compounds on solid support.  The  compounds will then be screened
              against specific receptors or  enzymes to obtain structure versus recognition
              information.  ***
