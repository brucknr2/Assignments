Abstract    :
              The  research  concerns the role of sensing  and  mechanical  design  in  motor
              control in both robots and  humans.    The  main  focus  is the determination
              of the mechanical  control  strategies  that humans use in manipulation  tasks 
              and  the  creation  of robotic controllers with comparable  abilities.  The 
              project involves three parts:  experimental measurement  of  human impedances
              in manipulation tasks, construction  of  simplified   models  of  the  human 
              control,  system,   and  evaluation  of  robotic task execution with human 
              impedance  characteristics.   This  work  will  enable   an   increased 
              understanding  of  human motor control, a  tool  for  human  machine interface
              design, and better robotic manipulation.
