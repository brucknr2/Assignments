Abstract    :
               The  objectives  of  this research are to  develop  compiler  and  runtime 
              optimization  techniques  for  parallel  programming  on  homogeneous    and  
              heterogeneous   high-performance    parallel  computers.  Specifically, this
              research addresses  the  following  issues: (1) Scalable  Parallel I/O-Scalable
              massively parallel computers must  include  scalable  I/O  systems  to  provide
               a  balance  between  computing  power  and  I/O. The  thrust of  this 
              research  is  to  investigate   compiler  transformation  for  parallelizing  
              I/O  operations,   stripmining  and  prefetching   data,  overlapping 
              computation  and  I/O, generate efficient I/O  access  schedules,  develop 
              runtime  support  that  can  recognize  and  use  access  patterns  to  perform
              efficient parallel I/O, and develop language  primitives that allow  users to
              specify parallel I/O operations; (2) Automatic  Data  Distribution for 
              Homogeneous  and  Heterogeneous  Systems-The  goals are to develop algorithms 
              to  automatically  generate data distributions that incorporate global
              analysis,  use  realistic   cost  models,  and  that  allow  dynamic 
              alignments,  distributions and data replication; and (3) Runtime  Support  for
              Dynamic Data  Redistribution-Dynamic  data  redistribution   may  be  necessary
               due  to  explicit   program  constructs,  compiler generated distributions, 
              across  procedure  boundaries,  or adaptive nature of a problem. The  goals 
              are  to  develop  parallel algorithms (including communication scheduling, 
              index  conversion, and space optimization) for runtime support for  dynamic
              data  redistribution.
