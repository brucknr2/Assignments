Abstract    :
              9357614  Schlom  This research involves the synthesis of oxide multilayers 
              uniquely suited to investigate solid state phenomena vital to the  development
              of integrated microelectronic devices utilizing the  extraordinary properties
              of oxides. Molecular beam epitaxy will  be used to grow epitaxial stacks of
              oxide superconductors,  ferroelectrics, ferromagnets, etc. with unit cell
              layering  precision.    ***
