Abstract    :
                    9357731  Stein      NYI - Embodiment Informs Cognition (Supplement)       
               This is a supplement to the above mentioned NYI award for the purpose of
              holding a  small workshop to cover the cost of participation of a small number
              of college and university  faculty members involved in teaching introductory AI
              courses.  This supplement addresses the  desire to provide improved educational
              and research opportunities to bridge the gap between the  capacities of current
              artificially  intelligent agents and human-like cognitive abilities, both
              issues  to be discussed from a point of view of classical undergraduate or
              first year graduate AI  education, indicating how a symbolic (linguistic)
              approach evolves from the interpretation of  arbitrary signals in terms of the
              human experiences.  The goals of the workshop consist of  providing information
              exchange relating to the nature of the introductory course, and addressing  
              new curricula issues and questions including the one related to the Stein award
              mentioned above,  but others as well such as the use and selection of
              instructional programming tools, and other  software repository issues related
              to Artificial Intelligence education.   A report or publication  is part of the
              results of the workshop.
