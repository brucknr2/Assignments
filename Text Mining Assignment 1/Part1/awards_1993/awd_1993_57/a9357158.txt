Abstract    :
              In this National Science Foundation New Young Investigator  (NYI) project of the
              Physical Chemistry Program in the  Chemistry Division Prof. Yongqin Chen of the
              University of  California at Berkeley will investigate the transition state 
              chemistry in photodissociation and chemical reactions in  real-time.  This will
              be accomplished with a new technique of  his design, transient stimulated
              emission pumping (TSEP), which  enables the probing of chemical processes on a
              femtosecond time  scale.  These investigations will be performed on gaseous 
              systems as well as on supercritical fluids.  %%%  Chemical reaction dynamics is
              at the forefront of present  research in chemistry.  The details of how a
              chemical reaction  proceeds can only be studied on time scales which are of the
               order of the period of one molecular vibration or less.  To  carry out such
              investigations requires experimental techniques  with ultra fast time
              resolution, on time scales ranging from  pico- to femtoseconds.  The new TSEP
              technique possesses  considerable advantages over other, currently used
              techniques  by, for example, generating an entire stimulated emission  spectrum
              simultaneously rather than by point-by-point scanning.
