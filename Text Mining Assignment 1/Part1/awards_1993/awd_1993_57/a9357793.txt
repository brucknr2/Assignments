Abstract    :
                 This research investigates application of theoretical tools to   analyze
              fundamental issues in machine learning, in planning from incomplete  
              information, and in  approximation algorithms.  In the area of machine
              learning,   one  direction is to provide new algorithmic techniques for fast
              learning when   there is much information available about objects  but only a
              small amount   is truly relevant.  These techniques are potentially useful both
              for speeding   up learning and for automating the process of selecting what
              information   is given to a learning algorithm.  Also new algorithms for
              learning using    neural networks are investigated, especially in the difficult
              case of high   dimensional input spaces.  Other fundamental research issues
              examined   include relationships between learning and cryptography, and various
              ways   a learner can usefully employ more active approaches.  In the domain of 
               on-line planning past work has been on strategies for traveling without a map 
               in scenes with simple types of obstacles, whose performance can be guaranteed 
               to be not too much worse than the best possible, if one had a map of the
              region.    This is expanded to more varied situations,  including those where
              some   kinds of partial maps are available.  One interesting case is where
              partial   maps are created by previous explorations.  Here one can combine
              ideas of    on-line planning and learning.
