Abstract    :
              9357190  Kasevich       This NYI award will support the research of a promising 
              and accomplished young investigator.  His research will  include experimental
              studies of quantum many-body effects in  weakly interacting atomic systems. 
              This will include non-  classical correlations between pairs of atoms and Bose-
               Einstein condensation.  ***
