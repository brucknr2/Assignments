Abstract    :
              9357017  Cyert    This is an NSF Young Investigator Award to Dr. Martha S.
              Cyert.   The overall objective of her research is to elucidate the 
              physiological functions and substrates of the phosphoprotein  phosphatase,
              calcineurin in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces  cerevisciae.  A major focus of
              her research will be to examine the  role and mechanism of action of
              calcineurin in the process of  adaptation to pheromone and recovery from
              pheromone-induced growth  arrest.  She will also examine the possible
              involvement of  calcineurin in regulation of the cell cycle.  Her experimental 
              approaches include techniques of molecular genetics and  biochemistry.    ***
