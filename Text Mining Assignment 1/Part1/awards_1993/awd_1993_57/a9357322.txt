Abstract    :
              9357322  Baker  The bacterial virus Mu i a member of a diverse group of genetic 
              elements that promote insertion of their own DNA into the genome of  a host
              cell by a specialized type of genetic recombination known as  DNA
              transposition.  Many elements, including retroviruses, utilize  this mechanism
              of integration, allowing them to insert at nearly  random sites in the host
              DNA.  The long term goal of this project  is to understand the molecular
              mechanism of transposition.  The  extraordinary efficiency of Mu transposition,
              and the nonpathogenic  nature of the virus, make Mu an ideal system for
              mechanistic  studies.  Recently, it has become clear that the active form of
              the  Mu transposase is a tetramer of the protein bound to the paired  ends of
              the element DNA.  Current knowledge of the chemical  mechanism of transposition
              based on work principally from the Mu  and HIV systems make it very attractive
              to consider that the  protein is activated by tetramer assembly and that the
              active  center of the protein may lie at constructed tetramer interface.   The
              experiments proposed here will locate and dissect the regions  of the
              transposase involved in catalysis and in tetramer contacts.   The roles of
              individual monomers within the active tetramer will  also be investigated.  %%%
               Transposition is the recombination reaction by which a genetic  element is
              moved from one DNA to another.  Studying this important  process will lead to
              better understanding of HIV DNA integration,  as well as other complex
              DNA-protein interactions such as  replication, transcription and RNA
              processing.  ***
