Abstract    :
              Much   of  this  research  continues  the  development   of   the  fundamentals
              of Polarization Vision for image understanding which  the principal 
              investigator initiated as a doctoral student. This  research  also continues
              the development of Polarization  Cameras  which  are  a  new  class  of 
              sensors that  automatically  sense  polarization  and compute either a
              visualization of  polarization  information,  or,  properties  of a  scene 
              that  are  physically  related  to polarization.  The additional physical
              dimensions  of  polarization  of  light  beyond that of  intensity,  carry 
              extra  information  from  a  scene that can  provide  a  richer  set  of 
              descriptive physical constraints for the understanding of images.  Past work by
              the principal investigator has revealed Polarization  Vision  techniques  that
              can be used to perform  dielectric/metal  material   identification,  specular 
               and   diffuse   reflection  component  separation  and analysis, as  well  as 
              complex  image  segmentations  that would be immensely more complicated  or 
              even  infeasible  using intensity and color information  alone.  A  new 
              intensity  diffuse reflectance model has been formally  developed  for  smooth 
              dielectric surfaces that generalizes Lambert's  Law.  Implications of this more
              accurate diffuse reflectance model  are  being studied for 3-D shape recovery
              from reflectance in computer  vision.   New  techniques  are  being  developed 
              for  3-D  shape  recovery   from   binocular   stereo  using   correspondence  
              of  photometric values.
