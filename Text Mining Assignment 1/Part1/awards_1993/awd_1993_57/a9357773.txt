Abstract    :
              9357773  Yip  The object of this NYI Grant is to  develop a category of
              intelligent  computational tools for scientists  and engineers.  Given a
              high-level  specification of a physical problem  in terms of nonlinear partial 
              differential equations, these tools  will be able to automatically: (1) 
              simplify that equations by  asymptotic techniques, (2) prepare  numerical
              simulation experiments  for the simplified model, (3)  monitor and control the 
              experiments, (4) interpret the  results in high-level terms, and  (5) derive
              qualitative predictions  form the model by approximate  analytical methods.
