Abstract    :
              9357600  Pennington  This is a New Young Investigator Award for research on
              so-called  exotic superconductors.  These include organic superconductors, 
              heavy fermion superconductors, high temperature superconductors,  and the newly
              discovered fullerene or buckyball superconductors.   The primary experimental
              technique to be used is nuclear magnetic  resonance.  The experimental program
              will involve collaborations  for the synthesis of new doped superconductors. 
              Theoretical  interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance signals from various 
              species in the superconductors is part of this project.  %%%  This is a New
