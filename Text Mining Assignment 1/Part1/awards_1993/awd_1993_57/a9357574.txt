Abstract    :
              The primary focus of this work is to resolve issues dealing with  the design and
              implementation of high bandwidth reconfigurable  interconnect systems based on
              Micro ElectroMechanical Systems  (MEMS) which are commonly referred to as
              Micromachines.  Different  guided-wave optical and holographic free-space
              optical switch  elements are being implemented and compared in terms of
              bandwidth,  switch reconfiguration rate, and range of programmability.  
              Application to data switching, and programmable interconnect  devices for rapid
              prototyping are being addressed with attention to  both technological and
              system-wide performance/cost design issues.   Comparisons are made with
              conventional technologies.  Also being  investigated is the application of some
              of the optical MEMS  elements to advanced image projection.
