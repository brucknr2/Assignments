Abstract    :
              9357756  Subrahmanian       Reasoning agents functioning in a dynamically
              changing world  often need to reason simultaneously in many different ways. 
              These  ways may include:  reasoning about time, reasoning in the presence  of
              uncertainty, reasoning in the presence of non-monotonicity, and  reasoning
              about diverse data structures.  In this proposal, we plan  to develop a uniform
              scheme for reasoning with hybrid  representations of data and knowledge.  We
              will develop prototype  implementations of this scheme as well as study
              application of this  scheme to diverse domains.
