Abstract    :
              9357520  Liu              This project is for one of the NSF Young Investigator
              (NYI)  awardees.  The awardee plans to investigate the transport phenomena  and
              surface properties of mixed ionic-electronic conductors.  The  intention is to
              improve the design of materials vital to batteries,  fuel cells, sensors, and
              devices for removal of NOx and H2S.  The  awardee also intends to inspire the
              students in the solid state  ionics, which will impact energy, environment, and
              the quality of  life.    %%%         This is a NSF Young Investigator (NYI)
              award.  The awardee  will pursue fundamental investigation into the solid state
              ionics.   The intention is to improve the design of materials for batteries, 
              fuel cells, sensors, and gas removal devices.  the awardee also  intends to
              inspire the students in solid state ionics, which will  impact energy,
              environment, and the quality of life.  ***
