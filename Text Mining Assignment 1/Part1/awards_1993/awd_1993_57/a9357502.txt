Abstract    :
              9357502  Francis         This project is for one of the NSF Young Investigator
              (NYI)  awardees.  The awardee intends to pursue three related projects.   One
              is concerned with sol-gel coatings for microelectronics.  The  second is
              concerned with piezoelectric ceramic polymer coatings.   The third is concerned
              with composites and coatings for dental  replacement materials.  The proposed
              work will address the  scientific issues involving the co-processing of
              dis-similar  materials, interfacial interactions, and property enhancement 
              through composite and coating design.  The awardee's teaching  enhancement plan
              also includes three key goals.  One is for the  course development and
              improvement.  The second is for research and  educational infrastructure
              development in the  microelectromechanical systems.  The third is to work with 
              undergraduates on research projects.    %%%       This project is a NSF Young
              Investigator (NYI) award.  The  awardee plans to pursue research projects
              relating to the  processing, design, and property development of ceramic
              coatings  and ceramic-based composites.  The awardee also intends to pursue 
              activities which enhance teaching in both graduate and  undergraduate education
              programs.  ***
