Abstract    :
                The goal of this research is to develop a tool-based framework  for the
              specification, analysis and implementation of real-time systems.  The  research
              includes three principal  components:  (1) a real-time  specification language,
              (2) analysis  techniques for showing that a specification is  correct, and (3)
              a  programming language in which the system is ultimately  implemented.    The
              specification component centers on the CSR paradigm, in  which a real-time
              system's high-level control structure is  entered as a set of  Ada-like tasks,
              which are then compiled  into a state-transition model.    For  the analysis
              component, an automated toolset based on the  technique of  finite-state
              abstraction is developed.  The  tools include a probabilistic  reachability
              analyzer, a  simulator and a model-checker.    The language  component is based
              on TCEL, a real-time  programming language with CSR-style  timing constructs. 
              This  feature allows the programmer to embed the real-time  requirements within
              the program itself.  A TCEL compiler is being developed, which  rearranges the
              code to meet the inferred  timing constraints.
