Abstract    :
              9357526  Montelione  Dr. Montelione will use NMR to characterize internal
              motions in  macromolecular complexes and intermolecular interfaces by 
              measurements of amide proton exchange rates and heteronuclear  relaxation
              rates.  He will measure saturation-transfer between  solvent and surface amide
              proton sites using pulsed field  gradient heteronuclear NMR experiments.  Dr.
              Montelione will also  use new technology for characterizing short-lived bound
              water  molecules on the surfaces of proteins and determine how these  molecules
              are displaced by ligand binding or complex formation.   These represent the
              next generation of techniques needed for  studying molecular recognition.  %%% 
              The proposed research involves development of heteronuclear  multidimensional
              NMR methods, biotechnology, and computer  software for characterizing molecular
              recognition in  macromolecular complexes.  The technology will be applied in 
              studies of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid complexes.  ***
