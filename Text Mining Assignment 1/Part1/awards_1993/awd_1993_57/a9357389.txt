Abstract    :
                9357389  Neufeld    This NSF Young Investigator award will support Dr.
              Neufeld's  theoretical investigation of astronomical masers.  He will explore 
              the physical conditions required to pump such masers, the  astrophysical
              phenomena which give rise to those conditions, and  the geometry needed to
              generate an individual maser feature of  given observed properties.  ***
