Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research, supported by the National Science Foundation               
              Young Investigator award, will study indices of elliptic                       
              operators on non-compact manifolds.  The information is encoded                
              in various homologies which are invariants of the large scale                  
              structure of the manifold.  Singular spaces will be studied by                 
              viewing them as a collection of non-compact manifolds glued                    
              according to their large scale structure.

              awardrecognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes              
              the recipient's strong potential for continued professional                    
              growth as a research mathematician and for significant                         
              development as a teacher and academic leader.
