Abstract    :
              9357093  Kiessling  In general, oligosaccharide-protein interactions that play a
                critical role in cell-cell recognition in the immune system   and
              structure/function relationships of RNA and RNA-protein   complexes will be
              studied. Cell adhesion at the molecular   level, where a specific complex
              between the tetrasaccharide   sialyl Lewis x and the E-selectin receptor has
              been   implicated as a mediator, will be studied.   This will lead to an
              understanding of how: (1) the   carbohydrate sequence determines conformation
              and   conformational rigidity of the sialyl Lewis x and (2) the   molecular
              details of complexation. This will allow the   development of new methods to
              modulate carbohydrate-mediated   adhesion. A new analytical technique for
              determining binding   of proteins to RNA will be applied with the IRE-binding  
              protein, which controls levels of iron regulatory proteins.   In addition, the
              mechanism of selective cleavage of   oligoribonucleotides at bulges and loops
              by a Cu(II) complex   will be studied as well as cleavage of DNA at hairpins.

              Interactions between carbohydrates and   proteins play a critical role in
              cell-cell recogition in the   immune system and these important interactions
              will be   studied. Understanding this complexation will be important   to the
              design of new drugs for the treatment of inflammatory   diseases such as
              rheumatoid arthritis and multiple   sclerosis. A new analytical technique for
              determining the   binding of proteins to RNA will be implemented to increase  
              the understanding of RNA-mediated gene regulation, which can   lead to new
              strategies to control cancer, viral infections,   and other genetic diseases.
