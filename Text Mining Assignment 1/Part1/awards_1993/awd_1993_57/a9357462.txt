Abstract    :
              9357462  Duran    This NSF Young Investigator award deals with research and
              teaching  in two areas.  The first is the behavior of two-dimensional polymer 
              foams compared with two-dimensional foams of classical amphiphiles.   The
              second deals with monolayers of glass-forming polymers at an  air-water
              interface.  ***
