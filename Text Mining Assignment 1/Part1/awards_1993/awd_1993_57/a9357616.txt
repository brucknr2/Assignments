Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research, supported by the National Science Foundation               
              Young Investigator award, will concentrate on various problems                 
              related to the Einstein equations.  Many of these problems are                 
              suitable for the application of perturbation methods in the                    
              presence of nontrivial kernel for the linearization.                           
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader. //
