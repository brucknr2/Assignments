Abstract    :
              9357226  Ashoori  This is a New Young Investigator Award for research on the 
              condensed matter physics of nanostructures.  The work employs a  spectroscopic
              technique developed by the principal investigator, to  quantitatively probe
              quantum levels in nanostructures.  The new  technique is termed single-electron
              capacitance spectroscopy, and  allow the detection of small numbers of
              electrons confined to  quantum dot nanostructures.  The technique will be used
              to study  problems in localization, many-body phenomena, and defect level 
              structures in nanostructures.  %%%  This is a New Young Investigator Award for
              research on the  condensed matter physics of quantum "dot" nanostructures: 
              collections of hundreds to thousands of atoms.  The work employs a 
              spectroscopic technique, developed by the principal investigator,  to
              quantitatively probe quantum levels in these nanostructures.   The new
              technique is termed single-electron capacitance  spectroscopy, and allow the
              detection of small numbers of electrons  confined to quantum dot
              nanostructures.  The technique will be used  to study problems in localization,
              many-body phenomena, and defect  level structures in nanostructures.  These
              phenomena are of  fundamental interest and potential technological relevance to
               ultra-small-scale electronic devices.  ***
