Abstract    :
              9357937  GREEN  This award provides support to Dr. Donald Green under the
              National  Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.  The 
              objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young faculty  in science
              and engineering, to enhance the academic career of  recent PhD recipients by
              providing flexible support for research  and educational activities, and to
              foster contact and cooperation  between academia, industry, and institutions
              that support research  and education.  Dr. Green has already made significant
              research  contributions to the field of political science, and he has the 
              potential to become a leader in academic research and education.     This award
              will allow the investigator to pursue his research  interests in the social
              psychology of intergroup conflict.   Specifically, he proposes to develop a
              statistical model of the  incidence of overt manifestations of intolerance, or
              "bias crime."   He will examine the over-time dynamics of bias incidents as
              well  as the cross-sectional relationship between incidents and economic 
              performance, demographic composition, intra-and interracial crime  rates, and
              survey measures of attitudinal intolerance.  This  research has important
              theoretical and policy implications.    Dr. Green also plans to continue his
              work on campaign finance,  party affiliation, the consequences of measurement
              error in survey  data, and the role of tangible self-interest in democratic 
              politics.  This work uses survey and experimental data to formulate  a theory
              about the conditions under which self-interest manifests  itself in political
              attitudes and behavior.  ***
