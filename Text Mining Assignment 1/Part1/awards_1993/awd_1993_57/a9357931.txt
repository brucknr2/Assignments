Abstract    :
              9357931  Kirchner       This young investigator proposes to extend recent
              advances in  watershed geochemistry by developing new techniques for inferring 
              mineral weathering rates; to develop and apply methods for  inferring spatially
              averaged long-term erosion rates from  cosmogenic isotope abundances in
              alluvial sediments; and to infer  coupling among topography, runoff,
              weathering, and erosion from  patterned terrain.  He will continue his research
              at the University  of California at Berkeley.
