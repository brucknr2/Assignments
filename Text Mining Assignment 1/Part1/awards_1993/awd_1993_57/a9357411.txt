Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in              
              the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                
              subfield of bioanalytical chemistry.  During the five-year tenure              
              of this award, Professor Kennedy and his students will pursue the              
              development of electrochemical microsensors and microcolumn                    
              separations, such as capillary chromatography and capillary                    
              electrophoresis, for the investigation of peptide                              
              neurotransmitters and hormones.  A major goal of the research is               
              the detection and continuous monitoring of zeptomole quantities                
              of peptides at single cells and in vivo with millisecond time                  
              resolution and submicron spatial resolution.                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The successful attainment of the goals of this project should                  
              enable the broad advancement of bioanalytical chemistry, in                    
              particular the analysis of minute quantities of neuropeptides and              
              hormones.  The proposed methods, including microscale sequencing               
              and microcolumn separations, will allow the detection of peptides              
              in specific regions of the brain or in single cells.
