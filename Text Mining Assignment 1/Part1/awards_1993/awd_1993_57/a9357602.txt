Abstract    :
              9357602  Mayes    This NSF Young Investigator award deals with research and
              teaching  in the area of finite size effects on the thermodynamics of polymer 
              blends and copolymers, roughness correlations in multilayer thin  films, the
              influence of compressibility on disorder-to-order  transitions in block
              copolymers, and forced nonlinearity in  addition copolymerizations as a
              synthetic route to new sequencing  schemes.  The research is both experimental
              and theoretical.  ***
