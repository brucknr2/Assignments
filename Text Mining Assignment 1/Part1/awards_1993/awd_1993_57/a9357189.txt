              9357189  Somalwar       This NYI award will support the research of a promising 
              and accomplished young investigator.  His research will  include the
              exploration of fundamental symmetries in particle  physics, including
              experiments with the neutral kaon system to  study CP violation and CPT
              symmetry.  ***
