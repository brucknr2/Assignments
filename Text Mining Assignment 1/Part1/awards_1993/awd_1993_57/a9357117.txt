Abstract    :
              The process by which RNA folds into a three-dimensional                        
              structure will be probed by the use of oligoribonucleotides                    
              containing alkyl thiol tethers. These tethers will be used                     
              to form disulfide cross-links, which allow mapping of the                      
              folding pathways of these macromolecules. These studies will                   
              define the general principles that govern ribonucleotide                       
              folding. In the course of this research, the following                         
              topics will be addressed: (1) The design and synthesis of                      
              unique RNA nucleosides that possess thiol tethers; (2)                         
              Incorporation of thiol-modified nucleosides into                               
              oligoribonucleotides by synthesizing several key RNA                           
              structural units; and (3) Mapping of the folding pathway of                    
              tRNA-Phe through disulfide bond trapping of folding                            
              intermediates.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              work of Professor Gary D. Glick of the University of                           
              Michigan. Functions of the important biomolecule RNA are                       
              mediated by the manner in which it is folded. This research                    
              will seek to define the principles that guide RNA folding                      
              and thereby will aid in predicting structure of this                           
              macromolecule and its function from the sequence of bases in                   
              RNA. The pathways of folding will be mapped by the use of                      
              derivatives of RNA whereby sulfur-sulfur bonds can be formed                   
              as markers. The research will be involve the synthesis of                      
              these RNA derivatives and the determination of the                             
              structures of intermediates in the folding process.
