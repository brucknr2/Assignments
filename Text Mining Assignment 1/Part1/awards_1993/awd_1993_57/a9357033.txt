Abstract    :
                This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award.              
              The awardee is using a combined genetic, biochemical, and cell                 
              biological approach to understand how centrosomes (spindle pole                
              bodies) replicate in cells, using as a model cell the yeast                    
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The centrosome is a subcellular organelle made up of a highly                  
              organized set of microtubules.  It serves as a microtubule                     
              organizing center for the cell, and is critical to the process of              
              mitosis.  During cell division, the genetic information of the                 
              cell, contained in the chromosomes, is apportioned equally between             
              the two daughter cells by means of microtubules arrayed in a                   
              structure called the mitotic spindle.  During the mitotic process,             
              chromosomes are dragged from the center of the spindle to either of            
              the two poles at opposite ends of the spindle, such that by the end            
              of the process each pole contains the appropriate chromosomes for              
              each daughter cell and the separation is complete.  This process is            
              controlled by the centrosomes, one of which sits at each pole of               
              the spindle.  At the end of cell division, each daughter cell                  
              receives the chromosomes and centrosome from one of the spindle                
              poles.  Thus, the centrosome must replicate before another round of            
              cell division can be completed.   This project will use modern                 
              molecular and cellular biology approaches, including the use of                
              yeast mutants defective in centrosome replication, to understand               
              how centrosomes replicate and function.
