Abstract    :
              The  purpose  of  this project is to bridge the gap  between  the  interactive 
              capacities of current robotic agents and  human-like  cognitive  abilities that
              have long been the  aim  of  artificial  intelligence  research.  The basic
              thesis  is  the  concept  that  embodiment  itself  both  enables and
              constraints  our  cognitive  capacities.  Through interaction with imagined
              stimuli  we  reuse  concrete machinery for abstract tasks.  By agreeing as a 
              society  to  interpret  arbitrary signals in terms of our experiences,  we 
              develop  symbolic language.  We understand music,  metaphor,  and  even
              mathematics by virtue of their relationships to our physical  experiences.  
              This project utilizes this thesis as a  foundation  and  further explores the
              ways in which sophisticated,  symbolic,  and  abstract  forms  of  cognition
              are  built  on  our  embodied  experiences.
