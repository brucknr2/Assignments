Abstract    :
              9357854 Penry  The roles that marine organisms play as mediators of physical and
              chemical processes and how they can affect the rates and extent of organic
              matter cycling and degradation in the ocean are not well defined.  In the
              ocean, planktonic protozoa are important consumers and remineralizers of
              organic matter.  Particle consumption is a primary pathway of degradation, and
              this project focuses on modeling and measuring digestive and egestive processes
              in marine protozoans.  Dr. Penry plans to apply a chemical engineering
              approach, i.e., chemical reactor theory, in the investigation of the roles of
              digestion and egestion by marine protozoan in particle aggregation and organic
              matter cycling.  Although protozoa do not have traditional guts, digestion
              theory is still applicable.  Gut reactor models are simply descriptions of
              particle processing patterns, and the reactor can be a gut or a single cell. 
              Quantifying these processes and how they vary in response to changes in food
              resources is necessary to understanding the roles of protozoan grazers in the
              upper ocean. ***
