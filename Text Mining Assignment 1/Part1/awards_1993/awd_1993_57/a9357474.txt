Abstract    :
              9357474  Hershfield  This is a NSF Young Investigator Award in which novel
              perturbative  techniques will be used to compute the nonlinear current-voltage 
              characteristic for tunneling through a single strongly interacting  atom or
              defect.  This type of system can be realized in atomic  asperity junctions,
              small area lithographically patterned tunnel  junctions, point contacts and
              quantum dots.  %%%  ***
