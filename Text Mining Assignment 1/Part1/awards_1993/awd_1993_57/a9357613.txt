Abstract    :
              9357613  Marston  This is a NSF Young Investigator Award which will focus on the
               theory of strongly interacting quantum systems, in particular the  anomalous
              transport properties of the cuprate superconductors.   Additional work will
              deal with the development of a comprehensive  many-body theory of charge
              exchange at surfaces.  %%%  ***
