Abstract    :
              9357512  Marand    This NSF Young Investigator award deals with research and
              teaching  in the area of phase transition phenomena in semicrystalline 
              homopolymers, copolymers, polymer mixtures, and polyrotaxanes.  The  aim is to
              relate chemical composition, crystallization, and  morphology to observed bulk
              properties.  ***
