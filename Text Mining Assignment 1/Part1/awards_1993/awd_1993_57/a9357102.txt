Abstract    :
              Dr. Nancy Makri is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Award                
              from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to                    
              develop and apply theoretical methods to the study of quantum                  
              dynamics of polyatomic systems.  New numerical schemes for                     
              evaluating real time path integrals will be employed to                        
              investigate proton and electron tunneling in condensed phase                   
              and large biomolecular systems.  Dr. Makri will also use this                  
              theoretical approach to study quantum coherence effects in                     
              intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution.

              By far the majority of important chemical and biological                       
              reactions take place in solution.  Many of these reactions                     
              involve the transfer of an electron or a proton form one                       
              molecule to another.  Quantum effects, including quantum                       
              mechanical tunneling, play an important role in such chemical                  
              reactions.  Dr. Makri is developing new theoretical methods                    
              which will provide an important molecular level understanding                  
              of such phenomena.
