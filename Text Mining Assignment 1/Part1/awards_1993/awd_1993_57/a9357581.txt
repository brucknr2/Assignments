Abstract    :
              Pomeranz         A method for solving CAD design and test problems, which is 
              especially suitable for solving large problems because it does  not deteriorate
              as circuit size is increased, is being explored.   The approach is to scale
              down the problem while retaining all of  its details; find high quality
              solutions for a sequence of small  circuits; develop rules for solving these
              problems; and then  scale up these miniature solutions into a solution for the
              large  problem.  Since the miniature solutions are optimal, the full-  sized
              solutions are expected to have very high quality.  Research  problems being
              explored are:  1.     test generation for various fault models on designs given
              at  the gate and higher levels;  2.     built-in-self-test methods;  and  3.   
               testing of synchronous sequential circuits that require two  pattern tests.
