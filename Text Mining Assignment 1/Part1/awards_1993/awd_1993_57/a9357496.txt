Abstract    :
              9357496  Trumble     This research is directed towards the liquid phase
              processing of  advanced metal-ceramic composites.  Poor wetting hampers the 
              processing of many composite systems.  Although interfacial  chemical
              interactions are thought to promote wetting, systematic  studies of their
              effects and associated microstructural development  are lacking. 
              Reaction-driven wetting is studied using the sessile  drop technique. 
              Infiltration of liquid metals into porous ceramics  is included in the
              research.  The role of chemical interactions in  wetting phenomena is examined
              through critical experiment coupled  with direct interfacial characterization
              using electron microscopy.  %%%  The knowledge generated in this program is
              fundamental to the  understanding of the properties of metal-matrix composites.
               This  understanding can be applied to tailoring the properties of these 
              technologically useful materials.  ***
