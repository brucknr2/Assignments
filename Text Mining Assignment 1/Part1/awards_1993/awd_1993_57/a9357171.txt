Abstract    :
              Proposal: 9357171  PI: Tolman    Professor Tolman, of the University of
              Minnesota, will  investigate the transition metal coordination compounds  with
              the assistance of an NSF Young Investigator Award  from the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program.  His research program is
              focussed on  two subjects, which are linked by their use of pyrazolyl  ligands.
               One of the projects will use these ligands to  prepare copper compounds that
              can interact with  oxonitrogen compounds such as NO; the objective is to use 
              simple coordination chemistry to enhance our  understanding of the role of
              copper in enzymatic  denitrification.  The other project will use chiral 
              versions of these ligands to bind metal ions in a chiral  3-fold environment;
              it is anticipated that such metal  centers will be able to mediate
              stereoselective reactions  in ways that differ significantly from the more
              usual  chiral 2-fold metal centers.  %%%  The presence of metal ions in
              molecules can endow these  molecules with unusual properties.  A real-world
              example  is found in certain bacterial enzymes, where copper ions  lead to the
              conversion of nitrite to gases such as N2;  this particular reaction is a major
              component of the  global nitrogen cycle.  The underlying chemistry of 
              copper-nitrogen compounds is presently very poorly  understood.  With this
              grant, simple molecules containing  copper and various nitrogenous components
              will be  prepared, and their reactions will be studied.  Another  example of
              unusual metal ion behavior is the ability of  molecules containing metal ions
              to have the property of  chirality (i.e., handedness), and thereby to catalyze 
              important reactions to give only one of a variety of  possible products.  This
              grant will enable studies of  such systems where the chirality is based on a
              three-fold  symmetry about the metal ion, rather than the more  unusual
              two-fold symmetry.  It is expected that this  change of symmetry will lead to
              substantial differences  in catalytic activity, poten tially of industrial
              benefit.
