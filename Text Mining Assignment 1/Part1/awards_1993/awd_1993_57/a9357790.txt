Abstract    :
               Photorealistic image synthesis is an important problem for  such  diverse
              fields as architecture, lighting and industrial design,  remote  sensing from
              satellites and robots, scientific  visualization, simulation  systems, and
              entertainment and  advertising.  It also requires enormous  computation. 
              Carefully  chosen approximations are therefore essential for  making the 
              computation efficient.  Unfortunately, few such approximations  admit good
              error metrics, which makes controlling image fidelity  difficult at  best.  In
              many applications this accuracy is vital.  This research develops a 
              controlled-precision rendering approach  for general systems of light transport
               both to provide reliable  bounds on accuracy, and also to allow an algorithm
              to  concentrate  its effort where the error reduction is largest.    In
              addition to  photorealistic image synthesis, research begins in
              non-photorealistic  rendering, an area with great  commercial potential that
              has received relatively  little  attention to date.  Mechanisms are developed
              to support the  generation of effective illustrations from three-dimensional 
              continuous-tone  images.  Specific research goals include creating  a taxonomy
              of traditional  illustration techniques; developing new  modeling paradigms,
              imaging models, and  user-interaction methods  for specifying and computing
              illustrations;  establishing methods  for simplifying geometric models from
              models with a higher  level  of detail; and developing techniques for
              simulating traditional  artist  tools, such as pencil, chalk, air brush, and
              watercolor.
