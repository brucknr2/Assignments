Abstract    :
              9357738   Chirikjian   This award funds the first-year base amount of a
              five-year NSF  Young Investigator Award. The research goals consist of two 
              separate projects.  First, the kinematics, motion planning, and  design of
              mechanisms with `binary actuators' will be investigated.  Robots with binary
              (on-off) actuators have a finite number of  states. Major benefits of binary
              actuated  manipulators are that  they can be operated without extensive
              feedback control, task  repeatability is very high, and two-state actuators are
              generally  very inexpensive, thus resulting in low cost robots for industrial 
              use.  Second, the design and coordination of `metamorphic' robotic  systems for
              use in unknown environments will be investigated.  A  metamorphic robot is a
              collection of independent modules each of  which has the ability to locomote
              over adjacent modules.  The  morphology of the collection of modules changes as
              a function of  the collective motion. Such self-reconfigurability potentially 
              gives metamorphic robots unique abilities. For instance,  modules  can `flow'
              into crevasses unreachable by fixed morphology robots,  or grow to form
              structures which envelop objects and form stable  grasps.
