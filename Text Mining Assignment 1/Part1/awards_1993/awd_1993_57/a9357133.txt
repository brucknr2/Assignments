Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in              
              the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                
              subfield of materials chemistry.  During the five-year tenure of               
              this award, Professor Greenlief and his students will carry out a              
              fundamental investigation of the decomposition of organometallic               
              containing magnetic metal centers as a possible route to the                   
              creation of atomically thin magnetic films.  Emphasis will be                  
              placed on the elucidation of reactive intermediates as well as                 
              the determination of the reaction rates of the decomposition                   
              reactions.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The successful attainment of the goals of this project should                  
              enable broad advancement in the area of materials chemistry, in                
              general, and the study of atomic-scale magnetic films in                       
              particular.  The research is technologically significant because               
              of the potential for development of thin magnetic films with                   
              atomic control.  Furthermore, this NSF Young Investigator Award                
              will significantly assist Professor Greenlief to establish a                   
              viable, innovative research program at the University of                       
              Missouri.
