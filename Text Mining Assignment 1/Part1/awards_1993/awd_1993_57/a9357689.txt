Abstract    :
              9357689  Rimoldi  NYI: Information Processing Problems in Wireless Communication
               Networks  We are approaching an era of personal communication that  requires 
              an infrastructure capable of providing untethered access to a  global network
              from any point on (and above) the surface of the  earth.  Implementation of
              this scenario in an already congested  radio frequency spectrum requires
              renewed efforts to understand the   design of more efficient information
              processing and network control   in wireless communication networks. We will
              mainly concentrate  our  efforts on information processing problems. One such
              problem is how  to ensure that a number of transmitters can send information 
              packets to a common central station in an efficient way. Solutions  that have
              been considered  for implementation so far are  suboptimal.  Of particular
              interest from both a theoretical and a  practical point of view is the use of
              codes based on lattice  structures. These structures can be used to design
              multiple-access  codes that approach channel capacity and are well suited for
              being  used with bursty sources with  a decoder of manageable complexity.  Also
              of interest  is the use of lattice structures to achieve  successively refined
              quantization of analog sources.
