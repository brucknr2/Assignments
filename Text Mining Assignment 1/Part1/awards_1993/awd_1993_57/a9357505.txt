Abstract    :
              9357505  Barrera     This research is directed towards the processing of
              advanced  materials with the Buckminsterfullerene, C60, as a reinforcing 
              species.  The emphasis is to develop an understanding of the  fullerene-metal
              interaction necessary for producing these  materials.  The research takes
              advantage of the atomic analysis of  surface and synchrotron radiation
              techniques.  %%%  The knowledge generated in this program is fundamental to the
               understanding of the properties of lightweight metal-matrix  composites.  This
              understanding can be applied to tailoring the  properties of these
              technologically useful materials.  ***
