Abstract    :
              9357000  Bell  The major goal of this work is to identify amino acids comprising
               the substrate-binding/active site of OMP decarboxylase (ODCase) and  to
              determine how they participate in the catalytic mechanism.   Specific
              objectives are: (1) to examine the role of putative active  site residues by
              changing these residues using site-directed  mutagenesis; and (2) to provide
              diffraction quality crystals of the  native and liganded OBCase for structural
              determination by x-ray  crystallography.  %%%  ODCase catalyzes the
              decarboxylation of OMP to UMP in the last of  six enzymatic steps required for
              de novo model enzyme because it  shares 51% homology with the ODCase domain of
              the bifunctional UMP  synthases from human and mouse.   Aside from its novel 
              decarboxylation mechanism (which unlike other decarboxylation  reactions does
              not require a metal cofactor), this enzyme is of  interest because defect
              results in the genetic deficiency, orotic  aciduria.  ***
