Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research, supported by the National Science Foundation               
              Young Investigator award, will continue Mrowka's program to use                
              gauge theory to investigate the differential topology of 4-                    
              manifolds.  In particular, he will work toward a better                        
              understanding of Donaldson's invariants and what they tell                     
              about4-manifolds.                                                              
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
