Abstract    :
              9357864  Sahr       This National Science Foundation Young Invesegotor intends
              to  expand his experimental and theoretical research in ionospheric  plasma
              irregularities.  The experimental program includes the  construction of a new
              VHF coherent scatter radar interferometer,  and development of improved radar
              techniques.  He also intends to  develop and test new theories of plasma
              turbulence in the auroral  electrojets.
