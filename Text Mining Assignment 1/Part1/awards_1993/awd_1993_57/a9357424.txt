Abstract    :
              9357424  Scherer  In this National Science Foundation Young Investigator project
               in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry  Division,
              Norbert Scherer of the University of Pennsylvania  will use time-domain
              spectroscopic techniques to study the role  of solvents on chemical reaction
              dynamics in dense media and at  interfaces.  New solvent-selective optical and
              far-infrared  (FIR) time-domain techniques will be developed to elucidate 
              solvent involvement in chemical reactions on a molecular level  in liquid,
              supercritical fluid, glass, and biological media.  Scanning tunneling
              microscopy will be used in combination with  femtosecond multiple-pulse
              techniques for the atomic specific  detection of chemical processes at
              interfaces.  %%%  Through the results of experiments conducted under this 
              research program Scherer will obtain a better understanding on  a microscopic
              level of how molecules collide, exchange energy,  and undergo chemical reaction
              in liquid and fluid media and at  interfaces.  The information and broader
              perspective obtained  from these studies have the potential for directly
              observing  and controlling chemical processes at the atomic level.  This  in
              turn has implications in such diverse areas as nanoscale  fabrication of
              materials and destruction of toxic wastes.  ***
