Abstract    :
              Proposal: 9357094  PI: Colon    Professor Colon of the University of Puerto Rico
              will  investigate long-distance electron transfer reactions; he  will do so
              with support in the form of an NSF Young  Investigator Award from the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and  Organometallic Chemistry Program.  One avenue of
              attack  will be through photophysical studies of myoglobin  bearing
              redox-active coordination complexes at various  surface sites.  The specific
              objective will be to  evaluate lambda, the reorganizational energy, and to 
              assess the distance dependence of lambda.  Another very  different approach
              will be to examine electron transfer  within the medium of layered synthetic
              materials.  These  materials will be based on zirconium phosphonates, which 
              will be intercalated with redox donors and acceptors.  By  this technique it
              should be possible to systematically  control the D-A distance, as well as to
              achieve vectorial  photoinduced electron transfer.  %%%  There is no doubt that
              the chemical process of  transferring an electron from one molecular site to 
              another can occur over distances long on the molecular  scale.  These
              processes, in fact, are essential in living  organisms.  Experiments will be
              conducted both to probe  the underlying factors that drive (or limit) this 
              phenomenon, and also to develop simple materials where  this process can occur
              in such a way as to mimic  biological photosynthesis.  This work should help to
               establish the theory of long-range electron transfer as  well as to apply it
              in a potentially useful way.
