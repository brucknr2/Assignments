Abstract    :
              This research investigated methodologies and efficient algorithms for
              performance-driven   layout design and logic synthesis of high-speed,
              high-complexity VLSI systems.  The   research on performance-driven layout
              focuses on interconnect design process, including   the development of accurate
              interconnect models which enable efficient layout   optimization algorithms,
              efficient algorithms for circuit partitioning and clustering ,  
              interconnect-driven floorplan and placement, interconnect topology design with
              buffer   insertin, simultaneous device and interconnect sizing, and clock
              layout optimization.  The   research on performance-driven logic synthesis
              mainly focus on synthesis and mapping   for field-programmable gate-arrays
              (FPGAs), including optimal or near-optimal   algorithms for structural and
              functional gate decomposition, minimum-delay technology   mapping trade-off of
              delay and area in technology mapping, combined retiming,   technology mapping,
              and resynthesis for clock period minimization, and automatic   pipelining.
