Abstract    :
              9357677  Kallinderis  The proposed research addresses large-scale simulation of
              fluid  flow and general transport phenomena.  The objectives are the 
              development of parallel adaptive numerical algorithms and dynamic  data
              structures which are portable and architecture-independent.   These
              developments should lead to dramatic increases in  computational performance
              and efficiency.
