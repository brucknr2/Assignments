Abstract    :
              ATM-9357862  Trumbore         This new National Science Foundation Young
              Investigator will  use measurements of 14C in detrital, soil and dissolved
              organic  matter to quantify the rates of carbon input, accumulation and 
              turnover in terrestrial ecosystems.  The understanding of ecosystem  carbon
              cycling developed from and constrained by this data will be  used to assess the
              effects of climate and land use changes on  terrestrial carbon storage.   ***
