Abstract    :
              9357108   Forbes   This NSF Young Investigator Award from the Organic Dynamics  
              Program supports the work of Professor Forbes at the University   of North
              Carolina, Chapel Hill on    biradical systems in an array of chemical systems.
              The specific   areas are: (a) studies of exchange couplings in novel semi- 
              flexible organic biradicals by exploring the effects of   unsaturation,
              spacers, temperature, and solvents with the   objective to evaluate the
              through-bond and through-space   mechanisms; (b) studies on diffusion of
              organic reactive   intermediates on solid surfaces using ultra fast
              time-resolved   EPR spectroscopy with emphasis on determining the influence of 
               solvents; (c) studies using biradicals as probes of polymer chain   dynamics
              and photodegradation including the use of supercritical   fluids; (d) synthesis
              of bi- and tricyclic ketones using olefin   methathesis; and (e) improving the
              multiple frequency   time-resolved EPR spectroscopy methodology.  %%%  With
              this NYI award Professor Malcolm Forbes will conduct studies   of organic
              biradicals in a variety of systems that range from the   synthesis of
              polycyclic ketones to olefin methathesis and anionic   polymerization. The
              research is largely aimed at determining how   the different parts of molecular
              systems communicate with each   other electronically and how external factors
              such as solvents,   temperature, and spacers influence the diffusion, dynamics,
              and   exchange couplings. The work will include diffusion studies on   the
              solvent/solid interface and studies on photodegradable   polymers.  ***
