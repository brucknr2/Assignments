Abstract    :
                  9357387  Bailyn  The PI will pursue research in the areas of compact binary
              stars  and globular star clusters.  Compact binary stars are systems in  which
              one component is a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole.   Often mass from
              the companion is transferred to the compact object  producing a variety of
              energetic phenomena.  The PI plans to  observe these systems at a variety of
              wavelengths to establish  their properties.  They can then be exploited to
              learn about unique  physical phenomena in the intense gravitational field of
              the  compact object.  Although most of the stars in globular clusters  are
              explained by the theory of stellar evolution, a small minority  have unexpected
              characteristics.  These anomalous objects are  thought to be the result of
              binary star evolution or stellar  collisions.  The PI will investigate such
              objects with the goal of  understanding the relationship between the dynamics
              of the clusters  and the evolution of the stars in them.  ***
