Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research, supported by the National Science Foundation               
              Young Investigator award, will address theoretical and                         
              methodological issues in Bayesian statistical inference.  The                  
              first topic concerns information-theoretic diagnostics to assess               
              and construct prior distributions.  The second topic involves                  
              using function space derivatives to perform sensitivity analysis.              
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.//
