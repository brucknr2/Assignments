Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in              
              the general area of analytical chemistry and in the subfield of                
              surface chemistry.  During the five-year tenure of this award,                 
              Professor Beebe and his students will carry out a fundamental                  
              investigation of the structure and reactivity of molecules                     
              adsorbed on solid surfaces.  Ultrahigh vacuum techniques will be               
              used to study single metal crystals and their reactions with                   
              small probe molecules.  Scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic               
              force microscopy are two additional techniques that will be used               
              to study molecule-surface and molecule-molecule interactions of                
              large molecules, such as DNA.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The successful attainment of the goals of this project should                  
              enable broad advancement in the area of surface chemistry, in                  
              general, and the study of molecular interactions on solid                      
              surfaces in particular.  These studies will lead to increased                  
              understanding of the fundamental chemistry of molecules adsorbed               
              on surfaces. Additionally, this NSF Young Investigator Award will              
              significantly assist Professor Beebe to establish a viable,                    
              innovative research program at the University of Utah.
