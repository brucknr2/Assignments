Abstract    :
              9357976  HAUSER  This award provides support to Dr. Marc Hauser under the
              National  Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.  The 
              objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young faculty  in science
              and engineering, to enhance the academic career of  recent PhD recipients by
              providing flexible support for research  and educational activities, and to
              foster contact and cooperation  between academia, industry, and institutions
              that support research  and education.  Dr. Hauser has already made significant
              research  contributions to the field of biological anthropology, and he has 
              the potential to become a leader in academic research and  education.    This
              award will allow the investigator to continue his research on  the evolution of
              cognitive ability.  By integrating theoretical and  methodological insights
              from cognitive neuroscience with  evolutionary biology, he will examine both
              the neural constraints  on behavior and the adaptive significance of a species'
              cognitive  machinery.  He will use observational and experimental techniques 
              on both captive and wild nonhuman primates focusing on the role of  hemispheric
              specialization in the categorization of visual and  auditory signals.  Results
              will shed light on the evolution of  cognition in human and nonhuman primates. 
                Dr. Hauser's research promises to make an important contribution  to
              knowledge at a time when scientists are just beginning to  examine the primate
              origins of social intelligence and the  evolution of language.  ***
