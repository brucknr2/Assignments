Abstract    :
              9357415  Sailor    This NSF Young Investigator award deals with research and
              teaching  in areas that include the chemistry of luminescent porous silicon, 
              and the role of chemical adsorbates and surface chemical reactions.   The
              potential of these materials for uses such as chemical and bio-  sensors, and
              detector and display applications will be evaluated.  ***
