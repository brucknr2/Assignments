Abstract    :
                  9357386  Adams  The PI plans to investigate two areas of astrophysics.  The
              main  focus of his work will be the theory of star formation.  In the  past, 
              he has studied the growth of spiral gravitational  instabilities in
              protostellar disks.  These instabilities can lead  to multiple stars in some
              cases and perhaps the formation of  planets.  The present goal is to understand
              binary star formation  and predict the mass function of forming stars.  Wave
              excitation  and propagation in molecular clouds will be investigated to clarify
               the conditions in which stars form.  The second area of  investigation is
              cosmology.  The PI plans to construct new models  of the inflationary universe
              and the background radiation fields.  ***
