Abstract    :
              Proposal: 9357130  PI: Therien    Professor Michael Therien of the University of
               Pennsylvania is the recipient of this NSF young  Investigator Award from the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and  Organometallic Chemistry Program.  He has
              launched his  career by developing a new synthetic strategy for  preparing
              substituted porphyrins, by using the method to  obtain a wide variety of
              donor-acceptor molecules based  on porphyrins, and by using these molecules to
              explore  the electronic coupling between the two centers.  Under  the present
              grant he will exploit these molecules in  order to assess the relative
              importance of hole versus  electron tunneling, to measure coupling through
              "weak"  links such as hydrogen bonds, to probe the significance  of quantum
              beats in ultrafast electron transfer, and to  develop catalysts for alkane
              oxidation.  %%%  Reactions in which an electron transfers from one site to 
              another are among the most intriguing, significant, and  at the same time
              apparently simple that can occur in  biological systems.  In such systems
              electron transfer  can take place over long distances, and then the 
              intervening medium assumes an important role.  By  designing molecules in which
              electron transfer can be  forced to flow through specified linkages,
              fundamental  and general questions can be answered regarding the  control that
              these linkages exert.  Such molecules will  be constructed on the basis of
              porphyrins, which are  molecules that are widely found to participate in 
              biological electron transfer.  The results will  illuminate the details of
              porphyrin chemistry, develop  the theoretical understanding of electron
              transfer, and  provide synthetic catalysts for industrially significant 
              reactions.
