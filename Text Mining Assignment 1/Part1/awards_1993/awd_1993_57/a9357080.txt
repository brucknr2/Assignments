Abstract    :
              This research project will focus on two main topics: mechanisms                
              of vegetation change and resource economics.  The research will                
              be conducted in areas of the Florida coast and will investigate                
              the effects of changes in flooding and salinity regimes on                     
              coastal plant communities.  Costs and benefits of plant root                   
              system developmental plasticity will also be addressed.

              Research of this type should have outputs of considerable                      
              importance to the better understanding and management of fragile               
              coastal environments like marshes.
