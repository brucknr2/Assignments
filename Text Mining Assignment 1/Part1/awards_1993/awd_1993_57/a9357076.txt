Abstract    :
              This research project will examine the potential conflict between              
              the theoretical benefits of phenotypic plasticity and constraints              
              imposed by preformation, a common developmental pattern in plants              
              of the pemperate environment.  The project will provide new                    
              insights into the potential for normal processes of plant                      
              development to circumscribe the conditions under which phenotypic              
              plasticity may be expected to evolve.

              Research of this type could have outputs of economic and                       
              agronomic importance in that commercial varieties of major food                
              crops are bred for specific environmental conditions and are                   
              notoriously unadaptable to new or different environmental                      
              conditions.
