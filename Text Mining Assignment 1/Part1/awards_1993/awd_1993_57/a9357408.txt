Abstract    :
              9357408  Truong  Dr. Thahn Truong is supported by an NSF Young Investigator
              Award  from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to pursue 
              theoretical research in the area of dynamics and mechanisms for  proton
              transfer reactions in solution.  Truong will perform studies  in the following
              three areas: 1) dynamics and mechanistic studies  of proton transfer in
              proteins; 2) dynamics and mechanistic studies  of heterogeneous catalysis
              reactions; and 3) "direct dynamics"  studies of chemical reactions in
              gas-phase, microsolvated states,  and in solution.  The primary methodologies
              to be used in these  studies include molecular orbital theory and molecular
              dynamics.  Variational transition state theory calculations will employ 
              semiclassical treatment for tunneling and quantal treatment for  vibrations
              directly from semiempirical molecular orbital methods.  %%%  Proton transfer is
              ubiquitous and important in virtually all  biological systems. In spite of much
              experimental evidence of  significant quantum effects occuring in such
              processes, not a lot  is known about the detailed dynamics of this fundamental
              process at  the molecular level. Truong's research will explore the process of 
              proton transfer in simple model systems in order to better  elucidate the
              mechanism for biological systems such as DNA base  pairs.  ***
