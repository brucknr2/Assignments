Abstract    :
              The  goal  is  to develop intelligent software agents  to  assist  naive 
              computer  users.  Several softbots (software  robots)  for  Unix  have been
              developed.  The softbots accept a diverse set  of  high-level  goals,
              synthesize and execute plans  to  satisfy  the  goals in real time, and learn
              from their experience.
