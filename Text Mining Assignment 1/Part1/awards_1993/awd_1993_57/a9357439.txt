              9357439  Grainger    This NSF YOUNG Investigator award deals with research and
              teaching  in the area of fabricating new materials by controlling molecular- 
              level organization and assembly, where applications to membranes,  films,
              coatings, derivatized surfaces and novel bulk media are  based on principles of
              supramolecular architecture.  ***
