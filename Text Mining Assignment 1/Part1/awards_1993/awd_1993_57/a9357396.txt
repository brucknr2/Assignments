Abstract    :
              9357396  Ryden    The research to be involved in this grant will be a survey  of
              the surface photometry of dwarf elliptical galaxies which  will be used to
              compute the shapes and surface brightness of  these galaxies.  Dwarf
              ellipticals are distinctly different  in their properties from ordinary
              elliptical galaxies.  The  dwarf ellipticals have lower surface brightness and
              smaller  total luminosity.  Because of these different properties, it  is
              likely that these two different classes of elliptical  galaxies have different
              formation and evolution histories.  If, however, the distribution of the shapes
              of the two  classes is indistinguishable, then this will be a strong 
              indication that the present shapes of elliptical galaxies  are a poor probe of
              their histories and initial conditions.    ***
