Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the analysis and modeling of  electrical
              performance of high-speed interconnects in electronics  packaging.  The
              finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, which  is a full-wave solution of
              Maxwell's equations in three dimensions,  is used to simulate signal
              propagation through interconnects.   Topics pursued are:  1.  Development of a
              computational scheme for  conformed finite-difference grid to model
              complex-shape  interconnects.  The objective of this scheme is to enhance the 
              resolution and accuracy of numerical solutions while maintaining  the
              computation efficiency associated with the regular rectangular 
              finite-difference grid.  2.  Analysis and modeling of electrical  properties of
              interconnection discontinuities in electronics  packaging.  Issues involved in
              this topic include:  modeling of  electrical characteristics of interconnection
              discontinuities over  the frequency range from dc to tens of gigahertz;
              evaluation of  impacts of parasitics associated with interconnection 
              discontinuities on the propagation of high-clock rate signals; and  development
              of design guidelines for typical interconnection  discontinuities in high
              performance electronics packaging.
