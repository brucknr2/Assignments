Abstract    :
              9357518  Reich  This is an NSF Young Investigator Award.  The research will 
              investigate the fundamental physics of materials at low  temperatures.  Focus
              will be on low-dimensional and other systems  dominated by geometrical
              constraints.  These include low-  dimensional quantum antiferromegnets, arrays
              of superconducting  rings, and superconducting granular composites.  %%%  This
