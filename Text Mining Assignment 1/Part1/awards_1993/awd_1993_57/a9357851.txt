Abstract    :
              9357851  Zhang  Reasoning algorithms are used in many application areas of 
              computer science and artificial intelligence, and high  performance of
              reasoning algorithms is indispensable to the  successes of these applications. 
              The objectives of this research  are to develop high performance reasoning
              algorithms, and to  apply these algorithms in formal verification of hardware
              and  software designs.  This research will substantially improve the 
              performance of a software system called RRL (Rewrite Rule  Laboratory) by
              adding new reasoning algorithms into it, and by  building new applications on
              the top of it.    The research will focus on redundance control of automated 
              deduction and mathematical induction, and efficient  representation of data
              structures.  The topics include restricted  inference rules, powerful
              simplification rules, unnecessary  computation detection, induction schemata
              formulation, induction  hypotheses handling, and efficient implementations of
              all the  involved algorithms.  Practical verification problems will be  chosen
              from software and hardware design as test problems for RRL  and RRL will be
              enhanced to meet the need of large-scale  applications by providing
              failure-resistant and user-friendly  interfaces.  Special effort will be made
              on distributing RRL  world-wide to the people who are interested in using RRL
              as  either a research tool or a teaching tool in automated reasoning.  ***
