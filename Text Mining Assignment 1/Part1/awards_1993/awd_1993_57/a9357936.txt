Abstract    :
              This award provides support to Dr. Caulkins under the National Science
              Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.  The objective of this program
              is to recognize outstanding young faculty in science and engineering, to
              enhance the academic career of recent PhD recipients by providing flexible
              support for research and educational activities, and to foster contact and
              cooperation between academia, industry, and institutions that support research
              and education.  Dr. Caulkins has already made significant research
              contributions to the field of operations research, and he has the potential to
              become a leader in academic research and education.  This award will allow the
              investigator to build on his existing research and to provide an intellectual
              basis for policies that respond to the problems associated with the
              consumption, distribution, and prohibition of illicit drugs.  During the tenure
              of his award Dr. Caulkins will (1) use price data as a window on market
              behavior and will compare arrest and seizure records with local price series
              data to see if enforcement can create `spot shortages` and, if so, how long
              they last; (2) study the relationship between wholesale and retail prices to
              estimate the effect of regional enforcement on prices; (3) study wholesale
              prices in different locations to better understand transaction/transportation
              costs, arbitrage efficiency, and the spatial character of drug markets; and (4)
              study how to divide resources between various programs such as interdiction,
              domestic enforcement, treatment, and prevention.  Illicit drugs are consumer
              goods, and the more that is understood about the markets for these goods, the
              easier it will be to design policies that mitigate the costs associated with
              those markets and, thus, to design interventions.
