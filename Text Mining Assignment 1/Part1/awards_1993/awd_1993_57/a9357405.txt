Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in              
              the general area of analytical chemistry and in the subfield of                
              surface chemistry.  During the five-year tenure of this award,                 
              Professor Crooks and his students will carry out a fundamental                 
              investigation of molecular recognition phenomena observed in                   
              organized chemical systems.  The research will involve i) the                  
              synthesis and characterization of surface-confined, self-                      
              assembling membranes, ii) analysis of electron- and mass-transfer              
              phenomena in ultrasmall domains, iii) electrochemical synthesis                
              and characterization of metal nitride and sol-gel-derived                      
              ceramics, and iv) the fabrication of quantum devices by scanning               
              probe induced lithography.

              The successful attainment of the goals of this project should                  
              enable broad advances in the area of surface chemistry, in                     
              general, and the study of molecular interactions in self-                      
              assembled thin films in particular.  The research results will be              
              used for the development of new chemical sensors based on                      
              molecular recognition phenomena.  Additionally, this NSF Young                 
              Investigator Award will significantly assist Professor Crooks to               
              establish a viable, innovative research program at Texas A&M                   
              University.
