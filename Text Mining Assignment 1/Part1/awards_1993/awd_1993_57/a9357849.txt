Abstract    :
                The probabilistic analysis of NP-hard problems has demonstrated  that  they
              are all not equally hard to solve  in practice; for example, Hamiltonian paths
              are easy to find on  the average, while random graph coloring still resists
              attack.  This project considers the class DNP (the class of NP  problems with
              input distributions) defined by Levin, and examine  the issue of whether DNP =
              NP?  While several DNP-complete problems  have been identified, none is a
              natural problem under a natural  distribution.  This work proves a  result of
              the type:  satisfiability or graph coloring under a  uniform distribution is
              DNP-hard.  In particular, it demonstrates  that random 3-SAT formulas exhibit a
              sharp threshold phenomena  with respect to the ratio of the number of clauses
              to the number  of variables and more significantly, to show that the random 
              instances of this problem are provably intractable when the ratio  is at the
              threshold value.  The general question demonstrates that  problems which admit
              a sharp threshold behavior are hard to solve  in the immediate neighborhood of
              the threshold value.  Another  problem considered is that of relating
              DNP-hardness to NP-hardness,  or perhaps some weaker intractability assumption.
               For example,  for some class of problems, does an efficient average-case 
              solution imply an unlikely outcome such as P = NP?
