Abstract    :
              9357513  Dravid         This  project is for the NSF Young Investigator (NYI)
              awardee.   The awardee intends to conduct basic and applied research related 
              to nanoscale phenomena in materials science, with an emphasis on  internal
              interfaces in solids.  New novel electron/ion beam  techniques will be
              developed to probe the structure, chemistry, and  electronic structure of
              defects and interfaces in solids.   Structure-property relationships for
              internal interfaces will be  established through a systematic and balanced
              experimental and  theoretical approach.  The awardee also has very extensive
              teaching  plans for undergraduates and graduates.    %%%         This project
              is a NSF Young Investigator (NYI) award.  The  awardee plans to study the
              internal interfaces in solids relating  to nanoscale phenomena.  The approach
              will be both theoretical and  experimental.  New techniques will be developed
              to probe the  defects and interfaces in solids.  This type of research aims to 
              develop the structure-property relationship.  The NYI awardee also  intends to
              carry on an extensive teaching activity in both the  graduate and undergraduate
              education programs.  ***
