Abstract    :
              9352964  Fleischman    Villanova University seeks to intimate a 6-week,
              residential Young  Scholars project in Biology and Mathematics for forty
              students  entering grades 11 and 12. The summer component combines course  work
              with extensive laboratory and research experience, and  includes field trips
              and panel discussions designed to increase  students' interest and awareness of
              research career paths. Academic  year follow-up activities includes the
              implementation of individual  research projects designed by the students during
              the summer.  Students will be recruited throughout the Middle Atlantic 
              metropolitan corridor from New York to Washington, D.C.
