Abstract    :
                  Valencia is in the process of implementing a Computer                      
              Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Training Facility to provide                    
              students with the opportunity to enhance their skills and to                   
              participate in applied research projects. The implementation                   
              includes acquisition, installation and testing of additional                   
              electronics equipment used in manufacturing and supported by                   
              curriculum revision.  As a result of the additional equipment,                 
              students study a fully automated Surface Mount Technology (SMT)                
              assembly process. The process can simulate almost any automated                
              assembly or test requirement. Electronics Engineering                          
              Technology (EET) and CIM students at Valencia will, as a result                
              of the additional equipment, be more independent in their                      
              critical thinking and decision-making in electronics                           
              engineering. Pre-engineering students on a professional career                 
              track will be able to enroll in courses that will teach the                    
              application of sophisticated instrumentation that will assist                  
              them in performing applied research and expand their vision for                
              design potential, manufacturing potential and quality                          
              potential.
