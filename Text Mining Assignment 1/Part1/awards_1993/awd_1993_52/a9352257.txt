Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to develop and implement a new "track-based"                
              advanced physics laboratory course, where students undertake a                 
              series of related experiments in a single area of physics.  The                
              experiments in a given track begin simply, and expand into                     
              greater levels of sophistication as the course progresses.                     
              Although the experiments themselves cover only one area, the                   
              experimental techniques used apply to many other areas of                      
              physics.  A comprehensive tutorial is to accompany and describe                
              the experiments, providing the necessary background and                        
              motivation for the laboratory investigations.  It is believed                  
              that such a track-based lab course is more effective than                      
              traditional physics laboratory courses at teaching students                    
              experimental physics, and at instilling in students a higher                   
              level of confidence and competence in the laboratory.Two tracks                
              will be created: 1) laser-based atomic/molecular/optical                       
              physics, and 2) acoustics.  The first track makes use of new                   
              and significant advances in semiconductor diode laser                          
              technology.  Applying recently-developed techniques, visible                   
              670-nm diode lasers are being made into tunable narrow-                        
              linewidth laser light sources, which emit at the wavelength of                 
              the D-lines of lithium.  Using these laser tools, fundamental                  
              phenomena in atomic and optical physics are being demonstrated.                
              The second track explores several aspects of classical and                     
              modern acoustics, with special attention paid to recent                        
              advances in quantum and non-linear acoustics.
