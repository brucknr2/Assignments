Abstract    :
              The mathematics department of Alverno College is establishing                  
              a mathematics classroom/computer laboratory as a site for                      
              innovative classroom instruction, designed to help students                    
              consistently experience mathematics learning as an active                      
              endeavor, and to allow an increased focus on independent                       
              exploration and realistic problem solving through individual                   
              and group project work. The mathematics computer laboratory                    
              will also provide opportunities for the all-female student                     
              body, especially prospective teachers, to gain experience and                  
              confidence in the use of modern mathematical problem-solving                   
              tools.  Students in the precalculus course regularly make use                  
              of graphing technology to study functions. In calculus, the                    
              college has been a test site for Duke University's Project                     
              CALC, of which computer projects are an integral part. Computer                
              projects will also be incorporated into the linear algebra                     
              course and subsequently into differential equations.
