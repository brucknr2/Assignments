Abstract    :
              9352905  Hallett  The Calculus Consortium based at Harvard University, with 
              funding from the National Science Foundation, has developed,  tested and
              disseminated an innovative single variable calculus  course.  The course is
              currently being used at over 125  colleges around the country and abroad.  In
              this project, the  effort is being expanded to include precalculus and the
              second  year of calculus.  A major component of the proposed project is 
              dissemination.  Information about the Consortium's single  variable materials
              has reached a large number of faculty at  diverse institutions.  The
              dissemination effort for the  proposed project is being modeled on the
              workshops,  minicourses, newsletters, test sites, and networking that have 
              proved successful in the current project.  ***
