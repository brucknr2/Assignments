Abstract    :
              A new modernized curriculum for teaching Engineering Design                    
              Graphics (EDG) was developed by Barr and Juricic as part of NSF                
              Grant No. USE - 8854623 (1990). This project is based upon the                 
              theory that an engineering design graphics currIculum can be                   
              taught in a different way such that the learning and interest                  
              level of students that have varied backgrounds can be                          
              optimized.                                                                     
              The concept involves moving earlier in the semester the 3D                     
              modeling work which is used as a tool to explain traditional                   
              concepts of 20 orthographic work as it applies to design and                   
              manufacturing. Students can relate to 3D modeling easily since                 
              they have dealt with 3D objects since early childhood.                         
              The success of the theory hinges on utilizing an "enhanced" CAE                
              Lab that is based on a unique "LINKING" hardware system that                   
              connects the instructor and individual students' computers                     
              allowing communication and individualized self-paced                           
              instruction.                                                                   
              This "individualized" approach will enhance the students'                      
              interest and desire to continue the study of engineering and                   
              allow them to exit the class with a more uniform level of                      
              knowledge and experience.
