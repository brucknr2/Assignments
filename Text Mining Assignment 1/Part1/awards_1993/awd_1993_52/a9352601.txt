Abstract    :
              9352601  Biggerstaff  The PIs have proposed equipment for an undergraduate
              laboratory  to study the structure and evolution of atmospheric storm  systems
              using interactive color graphics software at Texas A&M.   Many of the
              laboratory exercises have already been developed  and tested using existing
              research equipment.  The laboratory  will be used by majors and non-majors in
              introductory and  senior-level courses to illustrate the fundamentals of fluid 
              dynamics as well as the complex structure of atmospheric storm  systems. 
              Output from numerical structures as well as data  collected during special
              field experiments will be used to  develop the classroom laboratory exercises. 
              These data sets  will be made available to other interested institutions.  ***
