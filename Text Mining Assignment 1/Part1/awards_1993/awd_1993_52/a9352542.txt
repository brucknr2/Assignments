Abstract    :
              While much has been accomplished in the QLTC programs, several                 
              critical start-up issues remain. In this proposal we address                   
              the need for computer resources necessary for full program                     
              execution, specifically graphics-capable computers for module                  
              and presentation-material development in computerized classroom                
              facilities. These facilities will allow us to enhance                          
              quantitative reasoning skills in students by giving them                       
              computer-delivered materials 1) as class presentations, 2) as                  
              in-class active-learning opportunities, and 3) as out-of-class                 
              laboratory opportunities in the QLTC itself.
