Abstract    :
              This project provides biology majors, fulfilling degree                        
              requirements for an undergraduate research experience, with the                
              opportunity to do research in plant physiology and                             
              physiological ecology. It introduces students to computerized                  
              instrumentation to obtain data on physiological response of                    
              plants to environmental factors. Students obtain data in a form                
              that allows them to maximize their time and energy on data                     
              interpretation. The project also uses a portable photosynthesis                
              system, and a datalogger with micrometeorological sensors to                   
              enable students to collect field and laboratory data readily.
