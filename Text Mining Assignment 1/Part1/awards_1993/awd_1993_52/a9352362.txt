Abstract    :
              9352362  Martin  The enormous progress in computational technology has generated
              a  new methodology, computational science, for learning and advancing  the
              traditional sciences such as physics and chemistry.  We are  initiating
              fundamental change in undergraduate science education by  providing a model for
              computational-science laboratory instruction  in physics and chemistry.  We are
              setting up a seed laboratory  devoted to computational science and developing a
              curriculum for  computational degree options in undergraduate physics and 
              chemistry.  The faculty involved are developing the necessary  courses and
              course materials and the computer hardware to implement  the courses has been
              obtained.  The project personnel consist of  interdisciplinary teams of faculty
              with expertise in computational  physics and chemistry education and research,
              and computer science.   We anticipate that results of the project will be
              transferable to  the national scene in science education.  ***
