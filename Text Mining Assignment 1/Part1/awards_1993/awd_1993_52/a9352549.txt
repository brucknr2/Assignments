Abstract    :
              The proposed Instructional Co-generation Laboratory would                      
              expand our experimental instruction in thermodynamics, fluid                   
              mechanics, heat transfer, electrical generation, data                          
              acquisition, and system design. The requested system includes                  
              a gas turbine/generator, a waste heat boiler, a condenser, an                  
              absorption cooler, and a computer data acquisition and control                 
              system with continuous stack gas monitoring. The system will be                
              used to perform a series of experiments in our Mechanical                      
              Engineering and Engineering Technology programs. In addition to                
              the usual general performance evaluations, the experiments                     
              would include convection and two-phase heat transfer,                          
              psychometrics and stack gas monitoring. Both of our programs                   
              include senior project sequences which give the students                       
              experience in engineering design. Much of the engineering                      
              design for the proposed laboratory would be done--with faculty                 
              supervision--as projects in these courses. The completed system                
              would serve about 100 students per year by providing                           
              experimental operation and detailed performance analysis of a                  
              modern co-generation and cooling system.
