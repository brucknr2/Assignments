Abstract    :
              The project will upgrade and expand the organic, inorganic, and                
              biochemistry courses and student research projects at Gustavus                 
              Adolphus College through the purchase of a high-field                          
              multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The                
              instrument will be used in the introductory organic courses for                
              identification and structural elucidation of products via 1H                   
              and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The advanced organic course will be                  
              modified to include synthesis experiments which will make use                  
              of 13C and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, and to evaluate the               
              course of enantioselective reactions. The instrument will be                   
              used in biochemistry courses to illustrate aspects of protein                  
              structure and to measure rates of metabolic processes. The                     
              introductory and advanced inorganic courses will use                           
              multinuclear variable temperature NMR spectroscopy for                         
              characterization of products and the measurement of activation                 
              barriers.
