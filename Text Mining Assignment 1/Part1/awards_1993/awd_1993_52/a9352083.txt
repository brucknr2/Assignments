Abstract    :
              9352083  Armstrong  Brigham Young is developing an environment both physically
              and  pedagogically which will bring the capabilities of technology  into direct
              and frequent contact with large numbers of calculus  students. The vision is to
              involve a specific, well planned,  well organized and well managed computer lab
              component into the  two different reformed calculus settings as well as the 
              traditional calculus setting which currently exist at BYU.  The plan involves
              student centered projects in calculus which  will be carried out regularly
              (weekly) but independently of the  students' particular course enrollment. The
              pedagogical portion  of the plan involves designing, producing, and cataloging
              of  well thought out, insight provoking projects which can be  implemented
              through technology. In addition to the hardware and  software (projects), they
              are training a cadre of dedicated and  intelligent teaching assistants who are
              assisting students in  the laboratory setting in ways consistent with the 
              instructional aims of the mathematics programs.  A large number of the calculus
              students at Brigham Young are  mathematics education majors. A primary goal of
              the project is  for prospective teachers to be exposed directly to examples of 
              the best pedagogy in the use of technology.  In particular,  they will
              implement the NCTM standards on the use of technology  in the mathematics
              classroom in their calculus classes. It is  planned for all prospective
              teachers to take one of the reform  calculus courses.   ***
