Abstract    :
              9352421  Sisko                                Belleville Area College is
              developing a computer-aided calculus  program to increase student involvement
              and introduce students  to the technology (hardware and software) they will be
              required  to use in their professions. Students are being challenged to  become
              active participants as they use Mathematica to  understand the concepts and
              ideas of calculus. Computers are  being used by calculus students in directed
              laboratory classes  to reinforce the concepts and ideas of calculus. As
              Mathematica  performs the tedious calculations, students are developing an 
              insight and appreciation of calculus. "Real world" problems are  being stressed
              as students become proficient with the tools of  their future.
