Abstract    :
              9352199  Lincoln                              An Inductively Coupled Argon
              Plasma Spectrometer is being  introduced as a versatile instrument for a
              variety of  analytical tasks, and a shatter box rock grinder is being used  to
              facilitate sample preparation.  Quantitative analysis is  being introduced into
              the geology curriculum in a series of  courses, beginning with the
              high-enrollment Introductory  Geology course and culminating in upper-level
              courses and  independent research projects.  The Introductory Geology 
              students, predominantly non-majors, are devoting three weeks to  projects on
              water quality, in many cases working cooperatively  with City Water Department
              personnel on real problems in the  community.  All geology majors are learning
              principles of  instrumental analysis and rock-sample preparation in the 
              Petrology and Optical Mineralogy course.  They are applying  this to a group
              project; each year the class will work with a  different suite of rocks. 
              Students in Groundwater Geology are  having opportunities for more involved
              cooperation with the  City Water Department.  Students in Geochemistry and in
              Igneous  and Metamorphic Petrology are engaged in individual research 
              projects.  These experiences are encouraging students to  conduct independent
              research projects and submit theses dealing  with rock and water chemistry.
