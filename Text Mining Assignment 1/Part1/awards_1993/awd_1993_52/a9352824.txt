Abstract    :
              9352824  DeTurck  A full-scale revision of the entire Calculus program is being 
              undertaken making extensive use of student projects drawn from  scientific and
              business disciplines. The three main thrusts of  the revision are (1)
              substantial reconstruction of the first  and second year Calculus syllabi; (2)
              emphasis upon  collaborative learning techniques; and (3) use of computation 
              as a vehicle to encourage collaborative learning. The emphasis  is on designing
              and implementing means of presenting new  approaches to Calculus effectively on
              a large scale. To carry  this out in the context of a large research university
              with  2000 students per semester taking Calculus, materials are being  adapted
              from existing Calculus reform efforts. In addition,  materials and support are
              being developed for faculty and  students getting used to using computers to do
              mathematics and  to incorporating problems from other disciplines.Some sections
               of the new courses are team-taught with Math Education faculty,  assisted by
              secondary Math Ed students as a portion of their  preparation for teaching.
