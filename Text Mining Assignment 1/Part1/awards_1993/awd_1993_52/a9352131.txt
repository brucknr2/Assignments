Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to create new avenues of                            
              interdisciplinary collaboration among students in the natural,                 
              social, and mathematical sciences through instruction in                       
              advanced computerized methods of data acquisition, analysis,                   
              and modeling. The project involves the departments of Biology,                 
              Mathematical Sciences, Physics and Chemistry, Psychology, and                  
              Social Sciences, and emphasizes computer-based research methods                
              common to these departments.A common laboratory will house a                   
              network of Macintosh computers, software, and associated data                  
              acquisition boards including three powerful and versatile                      
              software packages, LabVIEW, STELLA II, and SYSTAT. Students                    
              will be introduced to the technology in an interdisciplinary                   
              laboratory course, "Computers in the Sciences". Skills and                     
              knowledge gained in this setting will be applied in various                    
              disciplinary laboratories, for which numerous experiments and                  
              exercises have already been designed and trial-tested in                       
              courses as diverse as Principles of Macroeconomics,                            
              Personality, and Neurobiology. Senior students will use these                  
              computing tools in their thesis projects, which will be                        
              presented in a new interdisciplinary seminar.We seek to                        
              generate an atmosphere of interdisciplinary collaboration using                
              new laboratory technologies which students are likely to use in                
              both graduate research and work settings. Students will be                     
              prepared to take their places in both basic and applied                        
              research projects which require an interdisciplinary                           
              perspective.
