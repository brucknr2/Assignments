Abstract    :
              9352037  Ensor  The presence of alpha emitting isotopes in the environment,
              whether  from natural sources or as the result of man-made activities, is of 
              increasing concern to scientists and the population as a whole.  A  photon
              electron rejecting alpha liquid scintillation (PERALS)  spectrometer provides a
              fast, accurate, and efficient method to  quantify alpha activity free from the
              interferences caused by beta  and gamma emissions generally present in
              environmental samples.   Students are using this spectrometer in a number of
              new experiments  in Radiochemistry and Environmental Chemistry and in projects
              in an  undergraduate research course.  Students enrolled in these courses 
              include not only chemistry majors, but students from civil and  chemical
              engineering, geology, biology, and secondary education  science. The PERALS
              system is giving these students hands-on  experience with the most modern
              counting equipment, and is allowing  them to gain insight into the procedures
              for and the difficulties  in the assay of alpha emitters in the environment.
