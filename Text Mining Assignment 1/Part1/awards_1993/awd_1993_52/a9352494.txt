Abstract    :
              This proposal consists of the upgrading of chemical                            
              instrumentation at Western Oregon State College for the purpose                
              of undergraduate instruction.  The project will provide                        
              students with laboratory experiences which relate to techniques                
              utilized in the modern analysis or research laboratory. It will                
              improve the infrared spectroscopic capabilities through the                    
              addition of the Perkin-Elmer Model 1650 FT-IR system.  The                     
              acquisition of accessories for multiple internal reflectance                   
              and diffuse reflectance measurements will offer the possibility                
              of developing new applications of IR spectroscopy for the                      
              teaching laboratory.  This instrument will be used extensively                 
              in organic, analytical instrumental analysis, advanced                         
              experimental chemistry courses and undergraduate research                      
              projects.
