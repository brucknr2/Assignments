Abstract    :
              9352943  Ray    The project proposes a decision making model that may be applied
              to  the resolution of development vs. preservation conflicts in all  regions of
              the country.  The project is designed to promote student  involvement and
              active participation through fact finding, data  analysis and debate.  The
              supplemental materials produced in this  project include 1) curriculum guides
              for students and teachers  consisting of three units that contain 10
              interrelated study  modules (Discovery Threats, Critical Thinking, and Find
              Solutions);  2) The Salmon Network (Net); 3) The Salmon Project Television 
              Series (8 - ten minute video programs for national broadcast); and  4) The
              Salmon Project multimedia slide show, software, and CD-  ROM(s).
