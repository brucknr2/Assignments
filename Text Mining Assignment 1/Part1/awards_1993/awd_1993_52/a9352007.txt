Abstract    :
              9352007  Ononye  NMR for Chemistry Laboratory Instruction and Research The 
              project will improve laboratory instruction and research  training by providing
              hands-on experience in the use of a  modern Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectrometer. The  hands-on experience will provide indepth training, and thus 
              equip the students with adequate competence and confidence  needed for pursuing
              carriers in science. The improvement would  be primarily through Organic
              Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis,  Physical and Research Chemistry and will
              provide students with  a solid foundation for exploring a variety of other
              science  disciplines including biological sciences, medical sciences, 
              agricultural sciences, environmental science, and engineering.   It will also
              help to increase the pool of well trained  scientists from this historically
              Black institution.  ***y
