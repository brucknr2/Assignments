Abstract    :
              The use of remote sensing and Geographic Information System                    
              (GIS) data in research today is an essential skill for every                   
              geographer. This project, therefore, has established a teaching                
              facility in Remote Sensing/GIS for the Geography Department.                   
              The equipment and facility are primarily used for teaching                     
              undergraduate students to analyze remotely-sensed data and                     
              combine it with GIS. It is also expected that the project will                 
              foster the development of remote sensing and GIS programs, and                 
              facilitate undergraduate education and training in the region.
