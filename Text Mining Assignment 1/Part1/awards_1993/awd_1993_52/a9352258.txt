Abstract    :
              9352258  Mims         This project will provide non-traditional undergraduate 
              computer science majors access to concurrent programming and  parallel
              processing. The Computer Science Program at this  institution services a large
              number of non-traditional  students. These students need remote access to
              parallel  computing facilities. The goal of the project is to establish  a
              network of parallel processors in the form of inexpensive  transputers that are
              accessible remotely via a network file  server connected to a telephone
              switching system. This project  will provide a model system of remotely
              accessible parallel  computing facilities at a minimal cost. ILI parallel
              processing  projects sponsored by NSF at other institutions serve as the  model
              for this project. This project enhances previous  transputer based ILI projects
              by addressing the specific issue  of providing non-traditional students with
              remote access to  parallel processing utilizing a network of transputers.  ***
