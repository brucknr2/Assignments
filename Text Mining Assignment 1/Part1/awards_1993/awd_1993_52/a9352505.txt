Abstract    :
              9352505  Famiano     It is expected that laboratory instruction using this
              equipment  will not only reinforce basic concepts and principles necessary  for
              an understanding of physiology but will also develop and  improve the students'
              critical thinking skills. It is further  expected that such laboratory
              experience will produce more  competitive transfer students as well as students
              who are  better prepared for today's workforce.     ***
