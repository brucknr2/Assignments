Abstract    :
              9352584  Ciardullo  Experimental astronomy provides a unique platform for 
              laboratory instruction. The nature of modern astronomical  observations
              requires sophisticated technology applied at its  limits. In addition, the
              field itself is perceived as exciting  by many students. These facts have led
              the Pennsylvania State  University's Eberly College of Science to upgrade its
              under-  graduate facilities in astronomy by renovating its telescopes, 
              providing new instrumentation for its laboratories, and  improving the quality
              of its undergraduate laboratory  instruction. The work will be continued by
              acquiring a science  grade CCD system to go on an existing 24-in telescope
              located  on the roof of Davey Lab, the home of the Department of  Astronomy and
              Astrophysics. This CCD gives undergraduate  students hands-on experience in
              observational astronomy and  helps provide them with a sense of participation
              in a  scientific enterprise. In addition, this new CCD allows the  small CCD
              now on the telescope to be moved to the classroom,  and thus upgrades the
              quality of instrument labs. By providing  access to the very latest
              astronomical instrumentation and data  analysis techniques, these improvements
              serve to encourage  students to pursue careers in science and engineering.  ***
