Abstract    :
              The project will purchase a Hitachi R-1200 Rapid Scan NMR                      
              Spectrometer. This instrument will greatly improve scientific                  
              instrumentation at Buena Vista College, and allow chemistry                    
              students an enhanced introduction to the principles and                        
              application of modern analytical technique. It will be used in                 
              the Organic Chemistry sequence, the Analytical Chemistry                       
              courses, in Physical Chemistry (Chemistry 351 and 352),                        
              Biochemistry, and advanced laboratory classes.  In addition,                   
              students will be able to carry out research projects in                        
              synthesis or solution processes in a manner not possible                       
              before. The new instrumentation will expand the capability to                  
              act as a scientific resource for a large rural area. Local high                
              school students and industry will be encouraged to use the                     
              facility through demonstrations.
