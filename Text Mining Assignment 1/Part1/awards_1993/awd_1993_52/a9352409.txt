Abstract    :
              9352409  Trachtman        The project will purchase a nuclear magnetic resonance
              spectrometer  for incorporation into organic, analytical, polymer and physical 
              chemistry laboratories.  This new instrument will allow a guided  systematic
              introduction of new experiments that will illustrate  principles of NMR theory.
              Approximately 550 students each year will  be provided with NMR theory and
              approximately 50 students each year  will be provided with hands-on experience
              to enable them to solve  problems related to molecular structure and chemical
              reaction.  ***
