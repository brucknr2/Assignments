Abstract    :
              This project establishes an Open Science Computer Laboratory to                
              serve the core chemistry and physics courses at Mississippi                    
              Gulf Coast Community College.  The Laboratory, equipped with                   
              networked IBM PS/2 computers, offers a four-level instructional                
              program:  computer simulation experiments; data analysis; data                 
              acquisition; and construction of a computer interface device.                  
              Through the Laboratory, the College will offer a 4-week summer                 
              course for area high school students exposing them to the                      
              material in level one and two of the physical science                          
              curriculum.
