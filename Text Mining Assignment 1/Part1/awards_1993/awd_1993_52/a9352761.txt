Abstract    :
              9352761  Karlin                               A hands-on, computer based course
              in 3-dimensional modeling and  analysis provides background and inspiration for
              a strong  undergraduate research program.  State-of-the-art computer work 
              stations and software provide for: (1) 3-dimensional molecular  modeling using
              both molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical  analyses; (2) analysis of DNA
              and RNA sequences as well as,  proteins; and, (3) 3-dimensional modeling and
              rendering of  images captured by digital microscopy.  These systems will be 
              integrated into laboratory exercises and activities which  expose students to
              practical use of the computers and software.
