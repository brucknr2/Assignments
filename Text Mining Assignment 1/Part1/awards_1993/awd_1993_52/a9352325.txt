Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to provide undergraduate civil                
              and environmental engineering majors laboratory experience                     
              analyzing organic and inorganic pollutants in water utilizing                  
              modern chromatographic instrumentation. The requested                          
              equipment, a capillary gas chromatograph and an ion                            
              chromatograph, will give engineering students the opportunity                  
              to become familiar with these important instrumental                           
              techniques, which they are likely to use in their professional                 
              careers. The equipment will play a key role in redesigning a                   
              required senior level laboratory survey course. The redesigned                 
              course will give students hands on experience in analysis in                   
              addition to in-plant experience in a drinking water treatment                  
              plant.
