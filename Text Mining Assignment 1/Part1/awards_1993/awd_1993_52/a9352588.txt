Abstract    :
              Improvement in the teaching of chemical kinetics in the                        
              undergraduate laboratories will be accomplished by adding                      
              kinetics experiments to the physical chemistry course and                      
              improving the current enzyme kinetics laboratory used in the                   
              biochemistry course.  One experiments will use spectroscopy to                 
              monitor the hydrolysis, while others will make use of                          
              temperature controls to study enzyme reaction rates.   Another                 
              uses stopped flow spectroscopy to measure rapid hydrolysis.                    
              Students have been involved in the initial development of these                
              experiments.
