Abstract    :
              9352973  Rao    Mercy College will initiate a five-week, commuter, Young
              Scholars  program in mathematical modelling for 30 students entering the 
              eleventh and twelfth grades.    This summer program  will use problems from the
              physical, natural,  and environmental sciences to introduce students to the 
              mathematical modelling process.  Students will study  differentiation,
              integration,ordinary differential equations,and  discrete dynamic systems.  The
              program will offer classroom  instruction and hands-on activities in the
              computer laboratory.  Weekly  visits to research centers will expose the
              participants to  career options, ethical issues and research methodologies in 
              mathematics and science.  All students will return to Mercy College   for six
              academic year Saturday sessions during which they will  visit additional
              research centers and complete a more comprehensive  modeling project.  ***
