Abstract    :
              This proposal requests instrumentation for a hands-on process-                 
              oriented laboratory experience in cell biology for intermediate                
              level students at Georgia Southern University. The pedagogical                 
              approach involves mastery learning, discovery learning and                     
              process learning. A few techniques are presented repeatedly                    
              with elaboration at each repetition. This allows students the                  
              safety of making mistakes, and it is through that safety that                  
              learning takes place. In addition to learning a few                            
              transferable skills thoroughly, we use the writing of a                        
              scientific paper as a vehicle to teach data analysis, data                     
              interpretation, writing skills, hypothesis testing, and                        
              protocol development. Our goal is to propel our students into                  
              a research experience which culminates in a complete, full,                    
              scientific paper and an oral presentation about techniques and                 
              equipment available for cell biology. Students are encouraged                  
              to keep a journal of their subjective thoughts concerning the                  
              lab.  This enables students in an unthreatening way to write                   
              about science, and to understand the precise and objective                     
              communication of scientific information.
