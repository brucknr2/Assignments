Abstract    :
              9352754  Melvin  This project allows the integration of a computer-based 
              experimental psychology laboratory. The students conduct,  analyze, and write
              reports on experiments as well as write  short research proposals. The project
              also integrates ongoing  faculty research into the student laboratory and
              permits the  construction and use of computer tutorials on the basics of 
              experimentation. The project is expected to impact psychology  majors and
              upper-level non-major students.  ***
