Abstract    :
              9352987  Woods    Southwest Oklahoma State University will initiate a 5-week 
              residential Young Scholars project in mathematics for 36 students  entering
              grades 10 thru 12.  Emphasis is placed on inquiry and  exploration.  Students
              learn to use powerful and exciting  computer software such as Derive,
              Mathematica, and Geometric  Supposer to explore topics from linear algebra and
              applied  mathematics.  Career/ethics of science discussions and field  trips to
              local industries and universities complete the project  activities.  ***
