Abstract    :
              9352951  Snyder    The State University College at Buffalo will initiate a five
              week  summer residential program in environmental science for 24 students 
              entering the 11th and 12th grades.  Special emphasis is given to  those
              scientific concepts that relate to Great Lakes research.  The  major goal of
              the program is to increase awareness of and heighten  interest in environmental
              science as a career choice.Environmental  science concepts and research
              methodologies as they relate to Great  Lakes research will be explored through
              lectures and hands on  laboratory activities.  Students carry out independent
              research  projects and present their findings at a closing day program.  
              Information on careers in environmental science, careers in pre-  college math/
              science teaching and college planning is provided  using discussion groups,
              panels of experts and field trips.  A  Great lakes education module outlining
              ways that high school  teachers can use Great Lakes environmental matters in
              their biology  courses will be developed by YSP faculty.  Research projects
              based  on approaches suggested in this module will be submitted to state  or
              regional science fair competitions.  ***
