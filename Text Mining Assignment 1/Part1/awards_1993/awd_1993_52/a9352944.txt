Abstract    :
              9352944  Mulder  The aim of this project is to develop a framework  (i.e., 
              definitions,,contributing disciplines, design/implementation  issues, major
              needs, major issues) for identifying the  discipline of  Information Science
              and Engineering (IS & E),  that is consistent with the modern need for
              information. An  innovative, technical framework is being developed that 
              integrates the following fields of study and practice:  data  base engineering,
              query languages, telecommunications,  human/computer interfaces, organizational
              structure/operations,  operations management, other elements of computer
              science, and  computer engineering.  Two recurring themes embedded within  this
              framework are problem solving/design methods and  applications, and hands-on
              implementation skills.The results of  this project will be useful  to: 1.
              Professional societies to  encourage the development of specific IS & E
              curricular and  course materials, 2. Institutions which may wish to evolve 
              existing information science, information systems, and related  programs, 3.
              Industry as a vehicle by which a continuing  dialogue can be established with
              institutions to evolve these  recommendations, 4.Industry to prepare their
              organizations for  the modern use of information, 5. NSF as a catalyst to
              identify  areas of future support.  ***
