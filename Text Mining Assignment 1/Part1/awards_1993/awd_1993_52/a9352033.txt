Abstract    :
              9352033  Toot  An image processing facility is being used in an observatory  for
              introductory astronomy laboratories. Five telescopes,  ranging in diameter from
              9 to 32 inches, serve as an excellent  base for efforts to expose science
              students and non-scientists  alike to both the practical side and the beauty of
               observational astronomy. However, in a desire to convey the  quantitative
              aspects of astronomy more fully, as well as to  show the current state of the
              field, more on electronic image  acquisition and analysis is being included.
              Our experience with  a relatively inexpensive CCD (the ST-6 from Santa Barbara 
              Instruments Group) convinces us that this goal can be  accomplished on a
              relatively small budget while maintaining  quantitative rigor. A useful and
              innovative program can be put  in place with a second of these CCD's and the
              installation of  a computer laboratory so that students can be taught the 
              appropriate software efficiently and also have access to the  computers for
              data analysis. Using a set of projects which  demonstrate the importance of
              quantitative measurements, while  at the same time allowing for a wide range of
              mathematical  skills, students can obtain a valuable exposure to the workings 
              of modern science.  ***
