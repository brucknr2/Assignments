Abstract    :
              9352381  Wolsey  The project will purchase a Fourier Transform Infrared 
              Spectrometer for incorporation into its total curriculum. IR is  the principal
              area in which existing instrumentation is  inadequate to demonstrate
              state-of-the-art techniques to  students in the standard courses, research
              students, and non-  science students. The significant sensitivity advantages of
              the  instrument will serve the needs of the Department's courses in  Analytical
              Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry,  Advanced Inorganic
              Chemistry, Instrumental Methods, and General  Chemistry.  The instrument will
              also be well suited for  student-faculty research projects. Students in a wide
              variety  of chemistry courses, including research students and students  in
              non-science courses, will have hands-on experience. Several  new experiments,
              which have not been possible with currently  available instrumentation, will be
              incorporated into the  curriculum.   ***
