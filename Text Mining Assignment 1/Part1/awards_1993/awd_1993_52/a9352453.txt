Abstract    :
              This project requests equipment to provide computer-based                      
              laboratory experiences for undergraduate archaeology students.                 
              Archaeology, by its very nature, is an experiential, hands on                  
              field. Yet ethical and legal concerns make it difficult to teach               
              archaeology using actual archaeological materials. Such concerns               
              are particularly important at Northern Arizona University, which               
              has large numbers of Native American students, the group most                  
              directly affected by archaeological research in this country.                  
              The PI is in the process of developing interactive computer                    
              programs in Hypercard on the Macintosh to teach archaeology using              
              visual images. The students analyze archaeological materials (for              
              example, pots, animal bones) on the screen, and interpret their                
              results. In doing so, students learn how archaeological data are               
              collected, analyzed, and applied within a problem-solving context.
