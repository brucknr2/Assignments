Abstract    :
              9352946  Hooper    The University of Minnesota seeks to initiate a six-week,
              commuter,  Young Scholars program in Life Sciences for 42 students entering 
              grades 11 and 12. The program offers students an experience in  research that
              is unavailable to them in regular high school science  classes. Students will
              participate in a Research Introductory  Program (RIP) and engage in laboratory
              research activities under  the guidance of faculty mentors and post-doctoral
              students at the  University of Minnesota.
