Abstract    :
              9352717  Gilmore                              The project will acquire a GC and
              FTIR with plotters for the  undergraduate chemistry program.  Laboratory 
              experiences will be emphasized which utilize the requested  equipment to bridge
              theoretical concepts with practical  applications. A useful by-product will be
              student exposure to  computer data bases as well as an improved understanding
              of the  FT function. . A greater success in transfer student's  adaptability to
              the four-year college laboratory experience is  a major objective of the
              improvements. In addition, district  science teachers will benefit from
              hands-on experiences in SSC  sponsored workshops.
