Abstract    :
              An innovative new capstone course, Radiation and Photobiology,                 
              challenges senior-level undergraduates to synthesize                           
              disparately acquired knowledge from the physical and life                      
              sciences into a common intellectual investigative field.                       
              Content areas such as photochemistry, photosensitization,                      
              environmental effects of high-energy radiation, circadian                      
              rhythms, vision, photomorphogenesis, photomovement,                            
              photosynthesis, and bioluminescence are developed in an                        
              investigative laboratory format.
