Abstract    :
              9352994  LeBlanc    The University of Toledo will initiate a three-week
              residential,  Young Scholars project in chemical engineering for 40 students 
              entering the 11th and 12th grades.  The UT Chemical Engineering  Summer
              Workshop will provide an exciting introduction to  the field  of engineering
              using a variety of experiences including laboratory  experimentation, hands-on
              computer instruction, independent group  investigations and field trips.
              Student presentations of  engineering experiments during the academic year
              follow up complete  the program.  ***
