Abstract    :
              The Electrical Engineering Department at West Virginia                         
              Institute of Technology is initiating the development of a                     
              comprehensive laboratory to provide "hands-on" training in                     
              control and robotics.  There are five workstations. The main                   
              components of these workstations are: a robot arm, a servo                     
              mechanism, an IBM 486 computer and Computer-Aided Control                      
              Engineering. The lab is flexible enough to allow students to                   
              investigate classical and modern control techniques for a wide                 
              variety of applications and use of neural networks and fuzzy                   
              logic in control.
