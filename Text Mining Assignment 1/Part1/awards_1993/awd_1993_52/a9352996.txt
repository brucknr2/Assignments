              residential, Young Scholars program on coastal and wetlands  engineering. The
              summer program will take place at McNeese State  University and the U. S. Army

              classroom instruction and  laboratory activities, students will be introduced
              to the theory  and practice of coastal engineering, wetlands engineering,
              computer  applications, ethics of engineering, technical writing, and career 
              counseling. In the wave tank laboratory, students will design,  build, and test
              models of erosion protection systems. Field work  will be done on coastal
              beaches and in wetlands.
