Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enhance and facilitate student                  
              understanding of data communications and computer networks                     
              through hands-on experiments. The project consists of a set of                 
              practical exercises on computer networking to supplement                       
              discussions in a computer communication networks course. New                   
              major equipment to be purchased consists of I) four                            
              SPARCstation ELC nodes, and a SPARCstation as file server                      
              running SunOs/unix, II) A network analyzer for Ethernet, and                   
              III) Upgrade PC-windows license of COMNET II.5 and LANNET II.5                 
              to department-wide license. New Unix hosts and the existing                    
              Novell local area network (LAN) laboratory of 9 IBM-compatible                 
              PCs permit students to experiment with 1) A multivendor LAN, 2)                
              Examine different network configurations, 3) TCP/IP                            
              internetworking and interconnectivity issues and 4) Writing and                
              testing network programs to handle a variety of data                           
              communication scenarios. The network analyzer will be used to                  
              monitor network traffic, decode protocols, and gain                            
              troubleshooting experience. The software upgrade allows                        
              students to be able to simulate simultaneously performance of                  
              a network on any PC node of the lab. The networking experience                 
              gained through this practical approach opens up new doors to                   
              our under-represented minority students in the current                         
              networking-oriented workplace.
