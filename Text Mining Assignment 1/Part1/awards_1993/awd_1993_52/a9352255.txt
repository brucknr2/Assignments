Abstract    :
              The teaching of animal physiology is being modernized and                      
              undergraduate research capabilities improved by adding six                     
              highly versatile, inexpensive microcomputer data acquisition                   
              stations and physiological instruments which interface with the                
              microcomputers.  The physiology stations provide several                       
              curricular improvements, which include: 1) adding new                          
              experiments; 2) students learning modern data acquisition                      
              techniques; 3) the microcomputer, interfaced to an overhead                    
              projector, used as a classroom teaching aid; 4) students                       
              gaining a better understanding of the scientific method because                
              they spend more time designing and performing experiments; and                 
              5) more undergraduates undertaking individual research                         
              projects.  The following instruments have been acquired for                    
              this purpose: Macintosh LC microcomputers, printers, data                      
              acquisition hardware and software (BIOPAC's Acknowledge),                      
              transducers, amplifiers, stimulators, equipment for a                          
              microelectrode station and an epithelial voltage clamp.  The                   
              new experiments include: 1) membrane and synaptic physiology of                
              frog neuromuscular junction; 2) physiology and pharmacology                    
              studies of smooth muscle in crayfish hindgut; 3) membrane                      
              physiology of clam heart, employing the sucrose gap technique;                 
              4) neurosensory physiology of cockroach leg nerve; 5) mechanism                
              of Na+ transport across voltage-clamped frog skin; and 6)                      
              cardiovascular physiology stimulated with Cardiovascular                       
              Function Lab (CFL).  CFL accompanies actual blood pressure                     
              measurements made in anaesthetized rats.
