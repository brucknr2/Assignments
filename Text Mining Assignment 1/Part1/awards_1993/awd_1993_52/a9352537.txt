Abstract    :
              9352537  Shikha                                                      This
              project allows the incorporation of computer-based instruction  in economics,
              with emphasis in economic statistics. Specific goals  include hands-on
              experiences for undergraduate students in the  field of statistical methods,
              different statistical packages,  development and maintenance of an economics
              data base, and  incorporation of different simulation techniques and case
              scenarios  in the analysis of basic economic principles. The project is 
              expected to upgrade the course content in introductory economics  and
              statistical methods, introduce students to different  statistical and software
              packages, and  help them become better  prepared for higher academic or
              professional careers. Students are  also able to use the computer lab for
              empirical research and  analyses, and the use of computers is being extended to
              other  courses in economics.
