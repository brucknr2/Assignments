Abstract    :
              Computer technology is being used in calculus and statistics                   
              courses to enable students to readily visualize mathematical                   
              concepts. The learning of the concepts is the primary focus,                   
              rather than the manipulation of symbols. Guided discovery and                  
              problem solving strategies enable students to develop deeper                   
              understandings and stronger intuitions of the material.  The                   
              technological tools available to today's work force are being                  
              incorporated into the mathematics curriculum, better preparing                 
              students for future employment.
