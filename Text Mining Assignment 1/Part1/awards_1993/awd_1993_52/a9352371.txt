Abstract    :
              This project incorporates global positioning systems (GPS) into                
              the education of mining engineers. Two Wild GPS - System 200                   
              units and associated postprocessing kinematic software will be                 
              purchased so that students can perform high-precision                          
              surveying. GPS will be incorporated into three surveying                       
              courses taught by the Mining Department at Montana Tech.  The                  
              courses and equipment will also be available to students in the                
              departments of geological, geophysical, and environmental                      
              engineering.
