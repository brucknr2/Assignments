Abstract    :
              This project will develop a model science lab at Chesapeake                    
              College's Cambridge Satellite Center in Dorchester County.                     
              Through the use of innovative, hands-on approaches as well as                  
              the direct use of multi-media, data manipulation and                           
              simulational software, this laboratory will be used to involve                 
              students in science and technology, help them to establish a                   
              science knowledge base from which to work, and encourage them                  
              to follow a career path in a science or engineering field.                     
              Faculty will revise the approach currently employ in teaching                  
              the basic biological and physical sciences to provide an                       
              enhanced learning environment that will call upon students'                    
              natural curiosity as a starting point in the design of                         
              experiments.  The Cambridge Satellite Center is located in                     
              Dorchester County, whose population is 27.9 percent African-                   
              American.  In 1991, 41% of all first-time, full-time freshmen                  
              from Dorchester County attended Chesapeake College, as did 79                  
              percent of all part-time undergraduates in the County. It is                   
              anticipated that this grant will markedly improve the                          
              recruitment of science candidates from a targeted minority                     
              population that resides in the area.
