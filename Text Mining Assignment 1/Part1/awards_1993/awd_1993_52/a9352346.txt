Abstract    :
              9352346  Brown  This project is designed to upgrade a laboratory which serves  
              sophomore-level courses in psychology and psychobiology. The  equipment
              includes microcomputers, networking equipment, and  multimedia capacity for
              advanced research and laboratory  training. With the improvements provided by
              this project,  students can replicate and extend recent research, develop 
              skills in the use of advanced computer technology, develop  skills for
              cooperative work in groups, and improve their  understanding of statistics. It
              is also expected that students  will develop a better understanding of basic
              scientific  principles, and improve their scientific writing.   ***
