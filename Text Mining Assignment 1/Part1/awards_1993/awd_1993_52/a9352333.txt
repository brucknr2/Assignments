Abstract    :
              9352333  Saadawi          This project establishes a Multimedia Communication 
              Networks Laboratory by enhancing the current Local Area  Networks Laboratory,
              to instruct senior undergraduate students  to understand and lead this
              technological evolution. The focus  of the Laboratory is placed on the
              practical hands-on  experiments that deal with identifying and resolving
              problems  associated with network operation and management, performance  and
              communication protocols, particularly with multimedia  service applications on
              the state-of-the-art facilities. New  experiments include a series of
              increasingly complex problems  ranging from monitoring performance of each
              network component  to designing an application program to multiplex, transmit
              and  receive multimedia services at different service access points.           
                                          The Laboratory includes  representative
              standardized networks and services from LAN and  WAN: Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN,
              X.25, Frame Relay and ATM  (Asynchronous Transfer Mode). Multimedia
              workstations equipped  with video and voice capabilities and protocol analyzers
              are  access points to the networks for laboratory students.  Interface, bridge
              and switching equipment connects the  networks. TCP/IP, OSI protocols and
              network management  softwares are implemented. The laboratory gives students 
              practical experiences of the real network environment with  advanced multimedia
              services. Furthermore, this laboratory  enhances and strengthens the
              undergraduate communication  network design course, encouraging students to
              pursue further  research activities.  ***
