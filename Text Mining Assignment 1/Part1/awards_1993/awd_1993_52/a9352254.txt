Abstract    :
              9352254  Okumura     A one quarter undergraduate laboratory course in surface 
              science is being developed in order to introduce chemistry  majors to concepts
              and techniques commonly employed in studies  of chemistry on surfaces.  This
              program  complements our  existing physical chemistry laboratory course which
              emphasizes  gas phase and condensed phase topics.  To incorporate the new 
              material, we are expanding the physical chemistry laboratory  from two quarters
              to three.  Five experiments are being  developed.  Students are performing
              three experiments on a UHV  surface apparatus: elemental analysis of surface
              composition by  Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), surface structure studies 
              using Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), and desorption  kinetics
              measurements of chemisorbed molecules by Temperature  Programmed Desorption
              (TPD).  In a fourth experiment, surface  structure is being studied in a
              complementary approach with a  scanning tunneling microscope (STM) in air; the
              emphasis is on  surface electronic states.  Finally, transmission FT-IR 
              spectroscopy is being used to examine structure of adsorbates  on supported
              metal particles.  The institution has already  purchased a vacuum chamber, LEED
              optics, and sample  manipulator, and made available vacuum pumps for the UHV 
              instrument.  This apparatus is being completed by including  sample mounting
              and introduction hardware, electronics, and  residual gas analyzer for TPD.  An
              instructional STM is being  used in the surface imaging experiment.  Finally,
              we are  upgrading an existing FTIR spectrometer for the adsorbate  spectroscopy
              experiment.    ***
