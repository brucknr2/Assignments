Abstract    :
              9352436  Morales  This project is part of a major curricular change in the 
              Biology Department to improve the undergraduate program. One of  the specific
              goals is to introduce into the genetics and  developmental biology laboratories
              new exercises that promote  a better understanding of modern molecular biology
              concepts.  Students will be introduced to current biotechnology by hands-  on
              experience in bacterial and plant transformation as well as  plasmid extraction
              and restriction mapping. The analysis of  gene organization and expression by
              non-radioactive Southern  blots and Western blots analysis will expose students
              to  methods of basic and biomedical research. Acquisition of  equipment for DNA
              and protein electrophoresis and supportive  equipment will bring the existing
              departmental facilities for  undergraduate teaching to the state of the art of
              biological  techniques. Since molecular techniques are becoming an  integrative
              common line in all the biological sciences,  including ecological and
              evolutionary biology, these  laboratories will be an asset for Biology majors
              and allied  health students with diverse professional interests.  ***
