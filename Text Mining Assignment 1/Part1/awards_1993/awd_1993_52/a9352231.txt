Abstract    :
              Despite the importance of phonetics in modern linguistic study,                
              there are no regular graduate or undergraduate course offerings                
              at the University of Washington in linguistic phonetics, due to                
              lack of facilities. Funding is requested for the purchase of                   
              equipment to establish a phonetics laboratory at the University                
              of Washington, thereby allowing speech analysis lab components                 
              to be included in several existing undergraduate classes. We                   
              will also be able to incorporate illustrative materials from                   
              the lab in other undergraduate classes.
