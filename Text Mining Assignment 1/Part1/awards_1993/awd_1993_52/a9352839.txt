Abstract    :
              9352839  Lamagna                                  A computational environment
              for students of calculus is being  developed. The system, called Newton
              (formerly The Calculus  Companion), runs on Macintosh computers and combines
              symbolic and  numerical computation with interactive computer graphics.
              Formulas  are easily edited and manipulated, appearing exactly as they do in 
              textbooks; mathematical operations are selected from menus.  Interactive
              dialogues have been constructed to guide students  through important
              computational techniques. A series of discovery  style laboratories are used to
              illustrate the concepts of calculus  using the software. This approach enables
              students to concentrate  on learning calculus, while freeing them from tedious
              and error--  prone calculations.  Particular attention is given to the use of 
              the system as a vehicle for creating interactive teaching  materials, and to
              finding ways to exploit the advantages that this  approach can have on student
              learning.
