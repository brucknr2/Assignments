Abstract    :
              An interdisciplinary computational and visualization                           
              laboratory/classroom (CVLC equipped with SGI Indigo                            
              workstations will be established in the Department of                          
              Mathematics. The CVLC will be utilized: (1) as a classroom and                 
              research laboratory for a new interdisciplinary Computational                  
              Science (CS) seminar, and (2) for enhancement of upper-division                
              courses in Math, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, CS, and                 
              Finance.  Students and faculty from the above-mentioned                        
              departments will interact with each other in the context of the                
              CS seminar. The proposed state-of-the-art computers will permit                
              student computational projects which explore current topics in                 
              research areas of interest to the participating faculty.                       
              Proposed topics range from parallel methods for eigenvalue                     
              problems to modeling particle dispersion by Monte Carlo methods                
              to stock option pricing. Graphical display methods will be                     
              stressed which take advantage of the excellent visualization                   
              capabilities of the Indigos. Multimedia features will promote                  
              dissemination through student presentations.  The CVLC facility                
              will allow computational topics to be effectively incorporated                 
              into existing classes. "Real examples" of results from                         
              applicable theory allow students to study complex systems which                
              are typically inaccessible to undergraduates.
