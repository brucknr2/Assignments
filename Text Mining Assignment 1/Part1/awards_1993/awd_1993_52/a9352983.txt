Abstract    :
              9352983  Conner    The Center for American Archeology (CAA) seeks to initiate a
              6-  week, residential, Young Scholars project in Archeology for 34  students
              entering grades 10, 11, and 12. The project is based on  the principle of
              research as education and stresses the multi-  disciplinary nature of
              archeology. Students will be introduced to  all aspects of archeological
              research, especially to the role  geomorphology, botany, zoology,
              bio-anthropology, and other  disciplines play in understanding past societies.
              Other learning  experiences include field trips, laboratory and experimental 
              activities. There will also be lectures and other classroom  activities that
              explore ethical issues facing modern  archaeologists, career choices, cultural
              history, and computer  applications to archeology.
