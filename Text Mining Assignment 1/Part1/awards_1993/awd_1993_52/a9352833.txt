Abstract    :
              9352833  Blanchard                            A large-scale revision of the
              traditional sophomore-level ordinary  differential equations course is being
              developed which emphasizes  qualitative theory with a distinct dynamical
              systems orientation.   A discussion of difference equations will precede the
              introduction  of differential equations, the computer will be used to analyze 
              solutions, and a more detailed discussion of nonlinear systems will  be
              included.  A consortium of colleges and universities will assist  in developing
              the syllabus and materials, as well as serve as  initial test sites for the
              textbook.
