Abstract    :
              The Computational Discovery Laboratory, an interdisciplinary                   
              state-of-the-art computer teaching laboratory, will provide                    
              biological, physical, mathematical, and social science majors                  
              at Benedictine College with the technology to learn and                        
              discover for themselves in a supervised environment. It will                   
              also support faculty/student research. The Computational                       
              Discovery Laboratory, consisting of eight Quadra 950s with                     
              appropriate software, will have a ninth mobile computer which                  
              will serve as a projection platform in the Laboratory and allow                
              for demonstrations in traditional classrooms and laboratories.                 
              The Laboratory will be used for a wide variety of applications,                
              including interfacing with biology instruments using MacLab,                   
              simulating chemistry experiments using Gantt, solving symbolic                 
              mathematics equations using Mathematica in physics and                         
              mathematics classes, writing computer programs in a structured                 
              laboratory setting in computer science classes, and analyzing                  
              data using SPSS in psychology, political science, and sociology                
              classes. The computers will be networked with the College's                    
              minicomputer, allowing students access other programming                       
              languages and, providing access to Internet/Bitnet when that                   
              becomes available. The Laboratory will serve as a model of how                 
              a group of departments at a small college can share a facility                 
              in order to provide state-of-the-art computing facilities for                  
              their majors.
