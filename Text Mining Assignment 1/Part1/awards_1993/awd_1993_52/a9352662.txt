Abstract    :
              9352662  Hart   The purpose of this project is to introduce science students to 
              the use of personal computers and transducers as laboratory  measuring
              instruments.  The students are encouraged to explore  setting their own
              parameters for the data acquisition  procedures and then to explore in greater
              depth problems which  particularly interest them.  The project is being
              implemented  in the two semester General Physics class, which is taken by  all
              Physics, Chemistry and Biology majors.  Each pair of  students provided with a
              computer interface setup which  consists of a Macintosh LCII computer and a
              Vernier Universal  Lab Interface with the appropriate transducers.  These
              setups  are being used in new experiments to study the details of  collision
              dynamics, phase change, Newton's Law of Cooling, and  waveform analyses related
              to the Doppler shift and  electromagnetic induction.  These setups are also
              being used to  improve existing experiments on moment of inertia and the 
              pendulum.  This project is significant because it provides the  only
              opportunity in our curriculum for science students to gain  experience with
              data acquisition by computers. Some of the new  experiments also contain
              innovative elements which may be  incorporated into laboratories at other
              schools.        ***
