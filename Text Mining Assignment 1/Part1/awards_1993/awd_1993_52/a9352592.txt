Abstract    :
              9352592  Dorfman  We have acquired equipment to enhance and strengthen our
              (required)  Solid State Laboratory course (PHY 431L) and (required) Senior 
              Thesis program (PHY 461,462).  We have purchased a high Tc SQUID 
              (Superconducting QUantum Interface Device) in order to introduce  magnetism and
              superconductivity into the laboratory course.  This  instrument is capable of
              advanced experiments and so is also used  by our Senior Thesis students to
              fulfill their Senior Thesis  requirement.  The remaining equipment enhances
              three existing  experiments, replacing borrowed, worn out, or incompatible 
              components.  The computer equipment is being used to automate two  experiments
              and to provide our students with the means to do  advanced data analysis.  ***
