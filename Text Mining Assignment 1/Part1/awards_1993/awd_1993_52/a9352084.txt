Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is reshaping its analytical chemistry                 
              laboratory courses such that students are studying and learning                
              analytical chemistry in the same way it is practiced by                        
              professional chemists.  A computer is being provided at every                  
              work station, where the computer is being used in conjunction                  
              with an interface and various sensors to control experiments                   
              and collect and analyze data.  This frees the student from much                
              of the drudgery of data acquisition and allows more time for                   
              thought-intensive activities such as decisions on optimal                      
              experiment design and the most appropriate way to treat data                   
              resulting from the measurements made.  In addition, because the                
              computer gathers large amounts of data rapidly and accurately,                 
              students are being exposed to experiments which are more                       
              complex and interesting than those previously possible.  The                   
              changes are bringing a new and exciting vitality to the                        
              analytical chemistry courses.  The equipment being used to                     
              achieve these goals includes 16 computers, 16 interfaces and                   
              associated sensors, and four printers to serve a total of 32                   
              students at a given time.
