Abstract    :
              The project will develop a course that will involve monitoring                 
              the accumulation of pollutants in a marsh that is used as a                    
              component of a storm water treatment system. A high performance                
              liquid chromatography system is being requested to give the                    
              students necessary training on that instrument and also to                     
              serve as an essential analytical tool in the project. The                      
              project will expose more students to the true excitement of                    
              scientific inquiry by challenging them with opportunities to                   
              participate in projects that investigate relevant problems.                    
              They will define the problem, design the protocol, collect and                 
              analyze the data, and draw serious conclusions when reporting                  
              the findings.
