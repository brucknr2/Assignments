Abstract    :
              9352146  Hirshfeld  The goals of this project are to (i) expand research 
              opportunities in observational astronomy for undergraduates;  (ii) identify and
              carry out specific educational research  projects that would be transferable to
              similar institutions  with small observatories, and (iii) produce written
              guidelines  and materials that would help faculty at these institutions 
              initiate their own undergraduate research programs in  astronomy. The primary
              instruments for the project are a CCD  imaging camera to supplement an existing
              telescope and  photoelectric photometer plus computers for data acquisition 
              and image analysis. The camera will be used by undergraduates  to obtain images
              of planets and extended celestial objects,  such as star clusters, nebulae and
              galaxies, and to do long-  term aperture photometry of bright eclipsing binary
              stars,  variable stars, and selected program stars in the Harvard  Center for
              Astrophysics radial velocity study. The significance  of this project, beyond
              its local impact on the education of  students, is its potential to improve
              undergraduate science  training by identifying ways to help faculty at other 
              institutions set up their own observational astronomy research  programs for
              students. The university is providing release time  for the principal
              investigator to carry out the project.  ***
