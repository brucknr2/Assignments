Abstract    :
              The project will purchase a state-of-the-art Fourier Transform                 
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer (FT-NMR) to provide                    
              rapid characterization and identification of compounds                         
              encountered by La Salle University chemistry students in the                   
              course of their research and study. Chemistry majors will gain                 
              insights into FT-NMR theory in Advanced Quantitative                           
              (Instrumental) Analysis and Physical Chemistry. Structure                      
              elucidation methods in NMR spectroscopy (particularly C-13 NMR)                
              will be introduced in Organic Chemistry, and effectively                       
              integrated into laboratories in Advanced Inorganic and Physical                
              Chemistry. The instrument will be used routinely in Advanced                   
              Organic Laboratory Methods. The capacity of students to                        
              understand modern NMR methods and their improved preparation                   
              for graduate school and for positions in industry will be                      
              evidence of the successful outcome of this project.
