Abstract    :
              9352582  Davison  Undergraduate students use advanced molecular graphics 
              workstations and appropriate software in an integrated series  of exercises
              which introduce molecular modeling into  biochemistry classes, beginning with
              simple viewing and  rotating exercises in introductory classes, proceeding
              through  examinations of DNA-protein interactions and calculations of  binding
              energies, and concluding with solutions of complex  problems involving protein.
