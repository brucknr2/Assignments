Abstract    :
              The project involves purchase of a powder diffractometer, a                    
              camera station, and the computer hardware and software                         
              necessary for their operation.  The instrumentation will be                    
              used to establish a modern x-ray diffraction facility which                    
              will enhance students' practical experience, strengthen and                    
              expand existing programs at the college, and improve the                       
              breadth of available laboratory experience for student                         
              research.  It will be used in both Chemistry and Physics                       
              laboratory courses that range from introductory experimentation                
              to advanced student research projects, and will impact                         
              virtually every science major at the College.
