Abstract    :
              This project will implement an interactive video laboratory                    
              based on IBM and Macintosh computers, CD-ROM and laserdisc                     
              players and videodisc for use in undergraduate science                         
              education. It focuses on increasing scientific literacy and                    
              sophistication among undergraduates, including significant                     
              numbers of non-traditional, women and minority students who are                
              typically underrepresented these fields. Faculty will                          
              incorporate interactive video technology into teaching in the                  
              following areas: biology, chemistry, and physics. The equipment                
              will give students, including elementary and secondary teachers                
              and non-science majors who need to meet science requirements                   
              for certification and degree-completion, the opportunity to                    
              focus on critical thinking as it relates to scientific study:                  
              formulating and testing hypotheses; solving problems; making                   
              decisions. Because of the ability of the technology to                         
              replicate experiments which faculty could not otherwise do, the                
              equipment will enable students to have a wider variety of                      
              laboratory experiences and multiple opportunities to                           
              hypothesize, test and revise than conventional laboratory                      
              experiments would allow. It would constitute a more "user-                     
              friendly" approach to science because it would alleviate fears                 
              about working in a laboratory and, particularly for future                     
              teachers, it would model for them active learning strategies                   
              and use of technology which is becoming widely available in the                
              Kansas City school districts.
