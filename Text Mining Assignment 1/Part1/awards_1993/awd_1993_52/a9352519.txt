Abstract    :
              9352519  Gerritsen  A new astronomy laboratory program is being established that
               will be central to Brown's introductory astronomy courses.  The  laboratory
              will include basic training in observational  techniques, observation of a star
              cluster (such as the  Pleiades) to develop an H-R diagram from which distance
              can be  calculated, and independent photometric investigations of  selected
              eclipsing binary variable stars.  The equipment will enable more sophisticated
              laboratory  exercises in the astronomy curriculum, allow students to pursue 
              independent investigations, and provide training for students  to take
              advantage of the more advanced opportunities for  research with astronomers
              from other colleges in the New  England Consortium of Undergraduate Science
              Education (NECUSE).   The availability of this equipment will attract more
              students  to the already popular astronomy courses at Brown and will  provide
              some of them who wish to do so the necessary background  to pursue advanced
              studies in astronomy.  ***
