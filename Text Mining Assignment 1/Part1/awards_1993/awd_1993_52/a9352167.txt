Abstract    :
              9352167  Harnack  Traditional weather laboratory materials consist of data 
              printouts which the student decodes, plots, and analyzes.  Available
              interactive software performs these and a number of  other important tasks on
              microcomputers thereby increasing  student understanding of the complex three
              dimensional motion  of the atmosphere.  Experience gained with the McIDAS (Man-
               computer Interactive Data Access System) software operating on  two
              stand-alone PC workstations makes it clear that the new  technology can be
              brought into the classroom for use in  completing laboratory assignments with
              real-time data.  This project is setting up a local area network in the weather
               laboratory classroom so that McIDAS and other similar software  is accessible
              by students during the two required senior level  laboratory courses, and by
              sophomores in an introductory lab  course, offered by the Department of
              Meteorology and Physical  Oceanography.  The affected courses' lab assignments
              are being  changed so that the students are gaining extensive experience  in
              the use of graphical weather analysis and display systems.  The equipment being
              used to accomplish this objective includes  a SUN SPARCsystem 10 (acting as
              file server) together with four  Gateway 2000 486/DX2-50 microcomputers (acting
              as student  workstations) in an Ethernet local area network.  ***
