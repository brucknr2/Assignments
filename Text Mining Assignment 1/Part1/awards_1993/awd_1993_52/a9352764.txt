Abstract    :
              9352764  Lall  A one year undergraduate laboratory in cellular and organismal 
              physiology emphasizes the molecular and cellular aspects of  excitable tissue
              (nerve and muscle) the first semester and  organismal physiology, including
              physiological adaptation and  ecology, the second semester.  The general
              outline for each  semester is to introduce new techniques and concepts the
              first  half of the semester and encourage student designed projects  the second
              half of the semester.  ***
