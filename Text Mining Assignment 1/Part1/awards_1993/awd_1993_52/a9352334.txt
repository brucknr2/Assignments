Abstract    :
              9352334  Barrick  a) equipping two classrooms with computers so that the
              students  may test their insights immediately, use the power of graphing  to
              reinforce mathematical concepts, and make approximation and  use algorithmic
              thinking components in all mathematics courses  at St. Gregory's College;  b)
              transforming the mathematics  curriculum by stages so that all mathematics
              courses will be  taught in a classroom involving computer use and according to 
              a syllabus that emphasizes mathematical concepts, graphing,  algorithmic
              solutions, and approximation;  c) utilizing these  classrooms as mathematics
              laboratories at times when they are  not used for classes;  d) providing
              laboratory experiences in  the physical and life sciences by computer that are
              not  feasible with the equipment available in the laboratories.  ***
