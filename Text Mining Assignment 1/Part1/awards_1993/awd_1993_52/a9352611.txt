Abstract    :
              This project is serving as a national model for undergraduate                  
              Mathematica laboratory instruction. A set of Mathematica                       
              laboratory notebooks for calculus and applied mathematics are                  
              being developed which will result in a complete set of                         
              laboratories for the Applied Mathematics sequence and the                      
              expansion of the current set of calculus laboratories.                         
              Calculus notebooks are focusing on multivariable calculus and                  
              on applications from other disciplines. The expansion of                       
              laboratory use and Mathematica notebooks to the three semester                 
              Applied Mathematics sequence is emphasizing mathematical                       
              modeling with differential equations; systems of differential                  
              equations; and advanced topics in mathematics including partial                
              differential equations, Fourier series, and boundary value                     
              problems.
