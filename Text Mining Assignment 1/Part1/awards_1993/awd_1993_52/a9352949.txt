Abstract    :
              9352949  Lipner    University of California at Berkeley seeks to intimate a
              4-week,  commuter Young Scholars project in mathematics with science related 
              activities for forty students entering grade 7. The project targets  students
              from groups that have been traditionally under-represented  in the fields of
              science and mathematics. In addition to structured  classroom lectures and
              laboratory activities, the program provides  for role models and mentors,
              visitation to research-oriented  science centers, and participatory in research
              activities.
