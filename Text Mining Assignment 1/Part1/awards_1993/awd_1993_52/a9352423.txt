Abstract    :
              Six work stations (4 students/station) are used in a problem-                  
              oriented laboratory experience which provides a realistic                      
              exposure to biology for students who will pursue other                         
              disciplines; and establishes a solid conceptual and technical                  
              foundation for those students who will continue in the biology                 
              major. At the core of the approach are several simple goals: to                
              remove the aura of mystery surrounding science and help                        
              students experience the process first hand; to demonstrate how                 
              concepts and techniques from diverse disciplines can be                        
              combined effectively to address a problem; and to teach                        
              students to think critically and communicate effectively. The                  
              equipment is also used in several other courses in the                         
              department and enhances the quality of the senior research                     
              experience required of all  biology majors.
