Abstract    :
              9352376  Diaz  A Multimedia Computer Laboratory for the Science Division, 
              consisting of workstations connected in a Local Area Network  with laser
              videodisc players and laboratory interfaces for data  acquisition, will allow
              for a radical change in the  undergraduate science curriculum. This change in
              the teaching  of calculus, physics, chemistry and astronomy and other science 
              courses will be achieved by using a "hands on" interactive  approach in which
              the student can explore the limits and  possibilities of the subject under
              study. The laboratory is  designed to stimulate the curiosity of students and
              will  hopefully develop the students' desire to search for answers,  promoting
              active and inquiring instruction for science and non-  science majors. The
              instruction will be individualized by  providing guidance for enrichment and
              accelerated learning,  breaking the barrier of the authoritarian traditional
              lecture  format.       We expect to provide a better science education for our 
              students by improving the present level of instruction and  enhancing their
              professional and technical qualifications by an  extensive training in the most
              modern computer technologies.   A change in the syllabi for these classes has
              already been  designed and the Mercyhurst faculty involved with them is 
              already prepared in the new techniques.  ***
