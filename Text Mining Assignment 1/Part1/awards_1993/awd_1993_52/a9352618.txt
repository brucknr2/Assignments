Abstract    :
              This project is improving the existing laboratory for the                      
              "Computer Systems" and "Computer Communication & Networks"                     
              courses at San Francisco State University by equipping the                     
              laboratory with new design and analysis tools. To reinforce the                
              material learned in the classroom, undergraduates are using                    
              software and design tools based on advanced queueing models and                
              digital circuit models to simulate the networks and computer                   
              systems that they design for their homework assignments and                    
              laboratory projects. Students are first learning the                           
              theoretical basis of computer systems, then designing various                  
              aspects of these components and systems, and finally testing                   
              their designs using computer simulations. In the newly                         
              structured courses, students are conducting actual simulations                 
              of their designs and are able to discover errors that are very                 
              difficult, if not impossible, to detect in a paper-and-pencil                  
              design. Students are uncovering their own mistakes in logic as                 
              they systematically check their own circuit designs and are                    
              increasing their understanding of the theoretical concepts used                
              in their designs.
