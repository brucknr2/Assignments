Abstract    :
              9352984  O'Nan    Rutgers University seeks to provide enrichment experiences for
              a  four-week summer residential Young Scholars program in mathematics  for 40
              students entering grades 10-12. The students will be  enrolled in various
              schools throughout the state of New Jersey. The  students will be introduced to
              problems and applications in  discrete mathematics during summer sessions with
              follow-up  activities during the academic year. The program provides for a 
              research experience with instructional sessions, conducted by  university
              faculty, on applications of graphs, algorithms in graph  theory, theory of
              numbers, and mathematical formulations of  fairness,
