Abstract    :
              9352699  Awad        A Fiber Optics Laboratory is being enhanced through the 
              acquisition of equipment which allows the offering of a much  more
              comprehensive curriculum that reflects current advances in  this emerging
              technology. The addition of research- quality  instrumentation  enables
              students to make measurements of a  critical nature to verify classroom
              theories and principles.  Also, the enhanced facility  enables students to
              grasp advanced  concepts in optics, polarization, semiconductor physics, fiber 
              optics and fiber optic instrumentation and related techniques.      This
              program is a part of the course study in the  Electrical/Electronics Department
              and  benefits courses open to  students in the electrical, electronics,
              computer, mechanical  and technical management programs. In addition, students
              use  the facilities to do independent studies to complete a  comprehensive
              investigation, or the design and assembly of an  optic communication or optic
              transducer system.     Also  conducted are small-group workshops for high
              school and college  faculty and their students in cooperation with
              representatives  from the fiber optic industry to ensure the new laboratory 
              facilities are used to their fullest.  ***
