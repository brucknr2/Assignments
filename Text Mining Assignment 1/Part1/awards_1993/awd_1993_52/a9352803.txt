Abstract    :
              The project involves purchase a 300 MHz FT NMR that would form                 
              the basis for upgrading several existing courses. The                          
              instrument would be used for new experiments being introduced                  
              into the chemistry and biology laboratory courses. Acquisition                 
              of this instrument would greatly expand the analytical                         
              capabilities for undergraduate laboratory and research courses                 
              as well as provide students with valuable "hands on" experience                
              in chemistry and biology to meet requirements for adequate                     
              career preparation.
