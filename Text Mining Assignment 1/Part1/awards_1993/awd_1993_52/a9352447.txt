Abstract    :
              The Anthropology Department is developing, evaluating, and                     
              disseminating digital image based, computer-assisted laboratory                
              education in human and primate skeletal biology. Satisfactory                  
              laboratory experience for introductory skeletal biology                        
              students is precluded at most colleges and/or universities as                  
              a result of limited collections of instructional specimens,                    
              which cannot be appropriately expanded. The present project                    
              seeks to utilize recent developments in digital image storage                  
              and display technology to enhance the Skeletal Explorer Video-                 
              Disk System for MS-DOS Workstations; to develop a parallel                     
              Skeletal Explorer application for Apple Macintosh workstations;                
              and to develop, validate, and disseminate laboratory                           
              instruction materials specifically designed for introductory                   
              courses, at educational levels ranging from community college                  
              through research university.
