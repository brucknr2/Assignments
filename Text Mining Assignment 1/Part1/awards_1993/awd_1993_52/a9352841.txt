Abstract    :
              The investigators are writing laboratory materials for and team                
              teaching an integrated three semester sequence of courses in                   
              calculus and physics. The sequence is covering the material                    
              normally developed during the first three semesters of the                     
              standard analytical calculus sequence and the standard                         
              engineering physics sequence taken by freshmen and sophomores.                 
              The core of the project is the creation of a series of mini-                   
              labs which develop analytical topics in tandem with physical                   
              principles using data-gathering equipment connected to personal                
              computers. The investigators are considering the long-standing                 
              pair of problems in introductory science education:                            
              applications meant to motivate the calculus are often developed                
              poorly and/or out of context by the calculus instructor, and                   
              mathematical tools needed in the physics course are often used                 
              by the physics instructor before they have been adequately                     
              developed in the calculus course.
