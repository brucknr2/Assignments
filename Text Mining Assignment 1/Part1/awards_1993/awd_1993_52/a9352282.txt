Abstract    :
              9352282  Veldkamp    Precalculus students and preservice teachers are the
              primary  beneficiaries of expanding the use of the computer laboratory  concept
              at Dordt College. A computerized approach to  mathematics instruction is
              enabling undergraduate students to  discover mathematical theories and use
              electronic technology to  come to a better understanding of mathematical
              concepts. With  secondary education mathematics majors as assistant 
              instructors, preservice teachers are obtaining hands-on  experience using
              electronic technology in the classroom and  teaching students to use such
              technology appropriately.  ***
