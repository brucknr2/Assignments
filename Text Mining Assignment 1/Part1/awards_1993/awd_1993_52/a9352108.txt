Abstract    :
              9352108  Warnet  A Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph/Mass Selective Detector 
              (GC/MSD) system is being used throughout the chemistry  curriculum.  Students
              are having hands-on experience with this  instrument in research-oriented
              experiments in courses and as  part of their research training.  In addition,
              students are  using the instrument in Freshmen Honors Chemistry, in the 
              Organic sequence for product separation and identification and  as part of a
              synthetic project, and in the Instrumental  Analysis course for analytical
              experiments.  The instrument  also is serving as a key component in our plan to
              expand  research opportunities for our majors.  One research project is  using
              the GC/MSD for separation and identification of products  from a coupling
              reaction catalyzed by a newly discovered  enzyme.  ***
