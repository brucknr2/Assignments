Abstract    :
              9352082  Magel  This project will develop a distributed computing laboratory to 
              provide facilities to support team projects for upper division  students in
              computer science and computer engineering. Juniors  and seniors in two advanced
              Computer Engineering and two  advanced Computer Science courses will work
              together in teams  to develop support tools for student use in those courses.
              Two  Computer Engineering students from one course will be paired  with two
              Computer Science students from another course to build  a hardware/software
              tool as specified by two other students in  another course. The mix of students
              from different colleges  with different computing orientations should provide 
              significant benefits to all, particularly a more balanced  appreciation for the
              total computer system. The tools will be  developed on a dedicated network of
              ten stations.   ***
