Abstract    :
              The intent of this project is to (1) adapt and refine for the                  
              two-year college environment existing microcomputer-based                      
              laboratory (MBL) curriculum materials and (2) to extend this                   
              area by developing additional MBL curriculum pieces that                       
              provide a more complete collection of laboratory activities for                
              introductory physics laboratories.  The targeted laboratories                  
              include the laboratory from the calculus-based course,                         
              trigonometry-based course, conceptual-based (liberal arts)                     
              course, and the technical physics (for technical/vocational                    
              students) course.  These curriculum pieces are being initially                 
              tested at two different two-year college laboratories and then                 
              tested further at several other two-year college sites.
