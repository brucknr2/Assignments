Abstract    :
              9352756  Lilly  This project proposes to address the need for more active 
              learning techniques through an experimental undergraduate  economics
              laboratory. The laboratory itself consists of a local  area network connecting
              a dedicated file server with desktop  computers. This lab also allows the use
              of software to simulate  a number of market environments, and thereby run a
              wide variety  of experiments which were previously impossible. These 
              computerized experiments have a number of advantages over  current
              noncomputerized ones. They are faster, data collection  and data storage are
              much easier, and more experimental control  can be exerted. It is also expected
              that students using the lab  will be able to access several statistical
              packages, including  graphics and other computer routines.  ***
