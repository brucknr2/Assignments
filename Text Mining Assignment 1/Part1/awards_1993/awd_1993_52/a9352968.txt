Abstract    :
              9352968  Yuen      The University of Hawaii-Manoa seeks to initiate a 6-week,
              summer  residential, Young Scholars program in the agricultural sciences  for
              26 students entering grades 11 and 12.  The Pacific Region  Program (PRP) will
              select students from Hawaii, American Samoa,  Guam, Micronesia, and the
              Northern Marianas.  The program will  consist of four interrelated components:
              classroom presentations;  field trips; research with mentors; and small group
              activities.   During the summer students will conduct research projects under
              the  guidance of scientists and learn how science is used to solve real-  world
              problems.  In the follow-up sessions during the academic  year, Hawaii students
              will communicate with American Pacific  students via PEACESAT, an international
              satellite communication  network.
