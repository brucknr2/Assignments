Abstract    :
              This project is improving the psychology curriculum by                         
              implementing a basic level laboratory course in behavioral                     
              neuroscience. The course is providing undergraduates with                      
              hands-on experience using current techniques and                               
              instrumentation within the context of addressing a relevant                    
              research topic. Laboratory exercises are being integrated into                 
              a group experiment designed to address a specific research                     
              question of current interest. Each student is being given a rat                
              to use for learning a sequence of basic techniques: lesioning,                 
              behavioral assessment (using computerized technology),                         
              histological procedures, and quantification of their                           
              neuroanatomical samples (using a computerized image analysis                   
              system). Data from all students is being pooled and analyzed                   
              individually (using SAS software). Each student is then writing                
              up the results within the context of the research question that                
              the group experiment addressed. Students are thus being better                 
              prepared for further inquiry in the neurosciences through                      
              advanced courses in the curriculum.
