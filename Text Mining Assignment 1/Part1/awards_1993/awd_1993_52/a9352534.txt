Abstract    :
              Acquisition of a 200 MHz (protons) NMR spectrometer operating                  
              in the pulsed FT mode, with variable temperature and two-                      
              dimensional (2-D) spectroscopy capability will improve the                     
              educational experience in the undergraduate chemistry teaching                 
              laboratories. The new instrument will be used by undergraduate                 
              students in three of the four core laboratory courses in the                   
              chemistry program of CMU. The new spectrometer will provide                    
              undergraduate students the opportunity to carry out modern NMR                 
              spectroscopy to elucidate the molecular structure of organic                   
              and inorganic compounds, to do studies of chemical kinetics                    
              including rapid exchange reactions, and will permit variable                   
              temperature 1H, 13C, and 29Si NMR spectroscopy. The                            
              undergraduates will become familiar with more sophisticated FT                 
              techniques and modern NMR data processing by computer. An off-                 
              line PC will be interfaced with the spectrometer to increase                   
              the throughput of the system and to enhance the familiarization                
              of students with the application of a PC in the laboratory. A                  
              hands-on approach will be pursued throughout the three                         
              undergraduate courses. During summer the spectrometer will be                  
              used by students participating in the Pennsylvania Governor's                  
              School for the Sciences.  A strong dissemination plan will be                  
              developed using publication in the appropriate journals, and by                
              distribution of packets with comprehensive descriptions of                     
              selected experiments, containing sections on feedback from                     
              students and on pedagogical results.
