Abstract    :
              9352974  Hamilton    Loyola University of Chicago seeks to initiate a 6-week, 
              summer eommuter, Young Scholars program with follow-up  activities during the
              academic year for 18 students entering  grades 11 and 12. The program is
              interdiseiplinary  integrating computer science, physics, and mathematics. The 
              students are introduced to basic computer arehiteeture,  after which they
              assemble IBM-compatible microcomputers that  are given to them to keep at the
              completion of the program.  Other activities involve students performing labs
              in digital  eleetronies, engineering and eomputer architecture, under  the
              direction of a research physicist. The students also  perform experiments on
              mathematical objects using computer  programs they write in Pascal. Field trips
              are an integral  part of the projeet. Career-oriented field trips will be  made
              to R&D and production faeilities sueh as AT&T Bell  Laboratories, Motorola,
              Roekwell International, and General  Motors.
