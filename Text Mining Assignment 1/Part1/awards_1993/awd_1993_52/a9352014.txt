Abstract    :
              9352014  McDonald      We propose the purchase of MacPacq data acquisition
              systems  for use in our Anatomy and Physiology courses. These systems  will
              enable students to make physiological recordings and to  produce lab guides
              using a cross-disciplinary approach. The lab  recordings will include standard
              measurements, such as  electrocardiograms and lung volumes, and demonstrations
              of  muscle and nerve responses to electrical stimulation.The  computers will be
              used not only to familiarize the students  with basic physiology concepts, but
              also to instruct them in  the manipulation, display and interpretation of
              scientific  data. We plan a collaborative effort between the Biology  students,
              Technical Illustration students and English  Department staff in the production
              of lab guides for the  equipment. These lab guides will be produced as
              Hypercard  stacks that will allow the students to step through the  processes
              of equipment set-up, data acquisition and reporting  of results. Producing
              these lab guides as an on-screen manual,  and utilizing the talents of students
              and faculty in several  different departments represents an exciting innovation
              in the  use of this type of equipment.The equipment and lab guides will  be
              demonstrated at the Women's Math and Science Network, at a  local Middle School
              and at the Missouri Community College  Association annual meeting.
