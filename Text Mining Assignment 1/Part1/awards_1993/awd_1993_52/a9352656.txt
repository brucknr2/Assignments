Abstract    :
              9352656  Quint       This project is enabling the Ventura College Mathematics 
              Department to establish a computer laboratory classroom whose  main purpose is
              to improve students' understanding of the major  underlying concepts in
              precalculus and calculus. The  mathematics faculty recognizes the need to
              utilize a computer  algebra system in these courses so that students spend less
               time manipulating symbols and more time clarifying and  visualizing
              mathematical principles.  The center is serving as  a classroom for weekly
              precalculus-calculus sessions. It is  also serving as the location of weekly
              supplementary courses  for precalculus-calculus enrichment. Finally, it is
              available  to students outside of class for completing homework  assignments
              and for attempting to find answers to their own  independent questions.
              Students are improving their  communication skills as they work together in the
               laboratory/classroom setting and as they integrate prose and  mathematical
              output into their assignments.        ***
