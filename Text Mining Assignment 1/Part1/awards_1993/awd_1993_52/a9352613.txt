Abstract    :
              9352613  Cordes  The project involves upgrading a lab course in astronomy that 
              gives students the opportunity to work with state of the art  optical and radio
              astronomy equipment. Work to be done includes  the upgrade of existing
              equipment to improve performance and  allow experiments and observations to be
              performed more  efficiently and purchase and construction of new equipment to 
              allow new kinds of observations on astrophysical masers and  neutron stars. The
              signal processing component of the course is  being strengthened considerably.
              Students are able to measure  neutral hydrogen from neighboring galaxies for
              comparison with  the rotation curve of our own galaxy. In pulsar observations, 
              students learn about time-transfer technology, dispersive  propagation in
              plasmas, and the rotations of neutron stars.  Maser observations teach students
              about coherent radiation  mechanisms. Students are taking part in some of the 
              construction of new equipment, interfacing of equipment to  computers, and
              writing of software.  ***
