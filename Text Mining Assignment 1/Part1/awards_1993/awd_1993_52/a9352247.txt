Abstract    :
              Frostburg State University's Physics and Computer Science                      
              departments have initiated an ambitious program with two main                  
              goals, to enhance physics students' experiences with computers                 
              as laboratory tools, introducing experiments in which a                        
              computer is a fully integrated element in the procedure.  Some                 
              existing experiments have been redesigned and some new                         
              experiments have been developed for the Intermediate and                       
              Advanced Laboratory courses to use a computer to control                       
              certain aspects of the experiment, as well as collecting and                   
              analyzing data.  The second goal involves a plan to create a                   
              framework for a double major in Physics and Computer Science                   
              with a concentration on the computer as a laboratory tool.
