Abstract    :
              This project has established an Integrated Geographic Analysis                 
              Facility to enhance the teaching of computerized Remote Sensing                
              and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies. The                     
              project addresses an immediate curriculum goal identified by                   
              the Department of Geography and Human Environmental Studies in                 
              its five-year plan: support for Remote Sensing coursework                      
              through digital image-processing technology. Students studying                 
              GIS are benefiting from the incorporation of Earth image data                  
              while students studying Remote Sensing benefit from the                        
              incorporation of ancillary GIS data. The integration of                        
              thematic mapping and spatial analysis activities through                       
              networked graphics workstations are also expected to benefit                   
              all levels of the Geographic Techniques curriculum.
