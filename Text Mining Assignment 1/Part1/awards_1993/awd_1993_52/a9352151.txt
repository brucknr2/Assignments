Abstract    :
              9352151  Weaver  Title: Upgrading and Automating an X-ray Diffractometer for Use
               in Undergraduate Teaching and Research                                X-ray
              diffraction is one of the basic tools for identifying and  understanding the
              structure of geological materials. The  current x-ray diffraction equipment was
              purchased in 1965 and  is now obsolete. The project will upgrade this equipment
              and  computerize the data acquisition and analysis tasks associated  with it.
              This equipment will be used in a new series of "hands-  on" experiments in
              Mineralogy and Crystallography, Petrography  and Advanced Mineralogy, and
              Theoretical Petrology. These  experiments are designed to promote active
              learning and empower  the students with the knowledge and experience of using a
               powerful tool that is beneficial in the study of a wide variety  of geological
              problems. An upgraded x-ray diffractometer will  provide important support for
              student research, a key component  of the geology curriculum.  ***
