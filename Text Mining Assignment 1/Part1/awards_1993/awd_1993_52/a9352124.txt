Abstract    :
              This project establishes a modern facility that will allow                     
              students to capture, quantify, analyze, and present visual                     
              images obtained from a variety of sources. The project greatly                 
              enhances the education of students by facilitating and                         
              promoting the "hands-on" investigations critical to                            
              understanding how science is done.  Student researchers capture                
              images of objects such as tissue sections, and fluorescing                     
              cells, and quantify these images quickly and easily to test a                  
              wide diversity of functional, developmental and evolutionary                   
              hypotheses.  The imaging facility includes MacIntosh Quadra                    
              computer workstations equipped with video cameras and software                 
              for image acquisition, manipulation, and reconstruction, and                   
              for statistical data analysis.
