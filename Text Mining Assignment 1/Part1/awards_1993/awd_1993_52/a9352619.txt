Abstract    :
              This is a project to establish a Computer Integrated                           
              Manufacturing (CIM) environment for undergraduate level CIM                    
              lecture and laboratory course. This is a new course which will                 
              be offered for the first time in Fall 1993.The project is                      
              consistent with the objectives of the Department and the School                
              of Engineering to develop CIM education. The main goals                        
              include: (a) providing a fundamental course and well-                          
              constructed lab experiments for undergraduate students so they                 
              can function better in a modern, industrial environment, (b)                   
              utilizing a state-of-the-art computer control system to                        
              integrate the many facets of a manufacturing facility, (c)                     
              furnishing an up-to-date medium for attracting and motivating                  
              minority and women students into engineering programs. The                     
              results of this project will be reported in professional and                   
              educational journals and conferences.At present, students learn                
              the components (design, manufacturing, and business functions)                 
              of computer integrated manufacturing. They have no opportunity                 
              to integrate the knowledge taught separately in the respective                 
              subjects. The CIM laboratory is intended to challenge the                      
              students to experiment on integration and explore different                    
              levels of hierarchical control. The equipment which will be a                  
              part of the laboratory includes 486 Personal Computers which                   
              will be networked and integrated with the Engineering Computing                
              Center, a Puma 560 Robot, Denford NC Machine, ASRS, and a                      
              closed loop conveyor.  A separate room has been allocated for                  
              the CIM Laboratory.
