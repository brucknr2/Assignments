Abstract    :
              The Department of Psychology is establishing a computer                         
              laboratory dedicated to giving students in perception and                     
              cognition lab courses tools for active learning and efficiently                
              teaching them to use those tools. Using a network approach,                    
              this lab will be used to develop Hypercard based laboratory                    
              exercises, demonstrations, and formal experiments in                           
              perception; and will serve experimental psychology and                         
              neuroscience courses in similar ways. It is expected that the                  
              programs developed as part of this project will also inspire                   
              students and teachers alike to construct their own.
