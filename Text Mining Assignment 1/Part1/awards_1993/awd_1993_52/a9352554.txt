Abstract    :
              The project will purchase computer and software equipment to                   
              develop molecular modeling curricula to meet two instructional                 
              goals: to introduce undergraduates to molecular modeling                       
              methodology, and to use molecular modeling to enhance student's                
              understanding of molecular structure and energetics. The                       
              practice will be integrated vertically into the undergraduate                  
              chemistry laboratories, from the introductory level through                    
              senior-level.   Students will investigate the structure of                     
              molecules, the effect of structural changes on the energy of                   
              molecules, and the effect of orbital electron spin density on                  
              the formation of chemical reaction products. In upper-level                    
              laboratories, modeling will be implemented on a SGI Indigo                     
              computer workstation. Students will investigate potential                      
              energy surfaces of chemical reactions, molecular dynamics of                   
              proteins, and electrostatic interactions between ligands and                   
              chelators.
