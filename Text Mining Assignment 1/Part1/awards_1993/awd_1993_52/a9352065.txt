Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to substantially improve the                    
              modern physics component of the laboratory in General Physics.                 
              This equipment is allowing the implementation of five new                      
              experiments into the curriculum of General Physics.  One piece                 
              of equipment, One-Piece Millikan Apparatus, is being used for                  
              an independent student project.In addition, the instrumentation                
              is being used to add two new experiments to the curriculum of                  
              Introduction to Physical Science, a course that satisfies the                  
              science requirement for non-science majors.
