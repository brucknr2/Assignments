Abstract    :
              9352604  Rios   The project will purchase an FT-IR for use in development of 
              new laboratory experiments.  The instrument will provide  undergraduate
              chemistry and biology students with the highest  level of scientific research
              training.  The purpose of the  proposed project is to enhance the undergraduate
              science  instruction at Turabo University (UT) by improving the existing 
              chemistry curriculum. These improvements in experimental course  content, will
              provide science and engineering students with a  deeper understanding of
              theoretical concepts and with an up-to-  date preparation for graduate school
              or employment.  The  instrument we are requesting will also provide professors
              and  students with much needed research experience using  sophisticated
              instruments.  ***
