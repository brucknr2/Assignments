Abstract    :
              Sixteen Apple Mac IIvx computer stations are used in an                        
              introductory laboratory curriculum for undergraduate non-                      
              scientists to improve the knowledge, skills, and enjoyment of                  
              non-science students by placing laboratory activities into more                
              relevant contexts and providing a variety of methods by which                  
              learning can take place.  Hands-on investigative activities are                
              the central focus of each lab session.  By integrating                         
              computer-based multimedia instruction into the curriculum the                  
              active learning that occurs through experimentation is extended                
              and the understanding of biological principles furthered.
