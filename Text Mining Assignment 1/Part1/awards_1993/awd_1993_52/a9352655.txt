Abstract    :
                         This project is integrating graphical, numerical,                   
              and analytical (GNA) approaches in all levels of the                           
              mathematics program at Adirondack Community College through the                
              use of classroom sets of handheld palm-top computers with                      
              DERIVE and graphing calculators. Pilot programs at Adirondack                  
              have shown that it is possible to transform the traditional                    
              mathematics classroom into an active laboratory environment                    
              with cooperative groups of students exploring concepts and real                
              world problems. The project is producing curricular and                        
              instructional changes resulting from the GNA approaches in a                   
              wide variety of courses ranging from arithmetic through                        
              differential equations. Corresponding reforms in student                       
              outcomes include an improvement in problem solving and critical                
              thinking skills, concept attainment, motivation, and making                    
              connections. This project is serving as a model of a hands-on,                 
              active mathematics learning experience for both high schools                   
              and universities.
