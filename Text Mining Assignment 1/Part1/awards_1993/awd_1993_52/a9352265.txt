Abstract    :
              9352265  Reed  The aim of this project is to incorporate an experimental
              component  in a new elective course on the fundamentals of wind engineering. 
              It is an interdisciplinary senior-level course that combines the  wind
              engineering aspects of environmental and structural  engineering, and
              engineering meteorology. Specifically, a sonic  anemometer is utilized for
              teaching basic measurement and analysis  skills that are essential for
              wind-related analyses in  environmental and structural engineering.
              Interpretation and  evaluation of wind speeds, intensities and integral scales
              of  turbulence for different exposures and averaging times are a part  of the
              course. Because the sonic anemometer  can be attached to a  lap-top computer
              and easily transported to various locations,  students can take the anemometer
              and computer to nearby urban areas  for evaluating air quality and pedestrian
              level wind effects.
