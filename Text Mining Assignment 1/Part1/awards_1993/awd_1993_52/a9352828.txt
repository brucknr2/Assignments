Abstract    :
              9352828  Wattenberg       Being continued is the development, dissemination, and
              assessment  of an integrated two-year sequence to replace five courses-- 
              Calculus I, II, and III, Linear Algebra, and Ordinary Differential  Equations. 
              The motivating idea driving and project is that these  subjects should be
              taught in the context of real and engaging  problems.  By studying these
              subjects in context, students are  better able to understand them and to use
              them outside the  mathematics classroom.  Pedagogically, the most important
              feature  of this sequence is the participation of students at a higher level 
              than is typical of traditional courses.  Emphasized are very  substantial and
              realistic problems that require the application of  a combination of
              mathematical techniques and that are open-ended,  often without clean, simple
              solutions.  Computers and writing are  essential parts of the approach. 
              Computers make it possible to  deal with more realistic applications and
              facilitate the  experimental approach that is emphasized.  There is a synergy 
              between writing and meaningful problems that engages on a high  intellectual
              plane requiring them to understand and articulate the  mathematics, the
              applications, and the connections between them.
