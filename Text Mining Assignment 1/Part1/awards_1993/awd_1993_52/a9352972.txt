Abstract    :
              9352972  Berken    St. Norbert College will initiate a three-week, residential, 
              Young Scholars project in mathematics for thirty students  entering the eighth
              grade from Native American tribes throughout  the U.S.  The hands-on activities
              will focus on applications of  mathematics to physics, biology, chemistry,
              geology, and  astronomy.  Lectures and laboratory activities explore concepts 
              that are culturally relevant to the participants.  Field trips to  the
              Milwaukee Public Museum, Discovery World, and the  International Crane
              Foundation are also featured.  Ethics of  science/career exploration activities
              and several follow-up  meetings complete the program.  Students are then given
              the  opportunity to participate in several other national programs  that are a
              natural extension of the St. Norbert YSP.  ***
