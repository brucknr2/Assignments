Abstract    :
              The United States Military Academy has implemented a daring and                
              innovative core mathematics program that addresses the 7-into-4                
              problem and the concerns of the calculus reform movement. A                    
              vital element of this program is progressive student                           
              development in certain threads of continuity - one of these                    
              threads being scientific computing. This project is equipping                  
              a computer laboratory/classroom for use in teaching students                   
              exciting and innovative uses of technology through structured                  
              laboratory instruction. This laboratory is also being used by                  
              the Center for Faculty Development to train instructors on how                 
              to effectively use technology in teaching mathematics. A third                 
              use of this laboratory is in a series of outreach workshops,                   
              where the laboratory is being used to "spread the word" both                   
              regionally and nationally on the use of technology in teaching                 
              mathematics.By implementing this laboratory within their highly                
              structured curriculum, each of the 2250 students enrolled in                   
              core mathematics is attending a laboratory session at least 5                  
              times over each of their first four semesters.  Thus every                     
              graduate of this institution will have at least 20 attendances                 
              in this laboratory. Each cadet also has his or her own personal                
              computer. The synergism generated between periodic laboratory                  
              attendances and assignments and projects on personal machines                  
              is assuring that students use technology in learning                           
              mathematics.
