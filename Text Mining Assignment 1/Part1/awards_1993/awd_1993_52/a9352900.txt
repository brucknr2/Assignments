Abstract    :
              The Washington Center for Improving the Quality of                             
              Undergraduate Education, is augmenting and extending for                       
              another two years the work of its Washington Center Calculus                   
              Project. The goals for the project are to build sustainable                    
              institutional commitment to calculus reform efforts already                    
              initiated, to deepen understanding of assessment tools                         
              appropriate to some of the new pedagogies being used in                        
              teaching calculus, to increase the number of institutions using                
              reform calculus curricula, and to document the dissemination                   
              model they are using for statewide calculus reform. This                       
              proposal broadens the scope of the work in which they are                      
              currently engaged, and focuses more upon sustaining and                        
              institutionalizing curricular reform, rather than initiating                   
              it, and upon developing and documenting assessment and                         
              dissemination methods appropriate to regional initiatives.                     
              Activities include assessment workshops, an Assessment Task                    
              Force with a seed grant program for assessment projects,                       
              curriculum workshops for faculty members, site visits,                         
              newsletters, and follow-up workshops.
