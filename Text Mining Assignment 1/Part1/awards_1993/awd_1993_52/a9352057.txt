Abstract    :
              The ILI request results from a two and one-half year MVCC                      
              Physical Science Department "pilot program".  This program                     
              involves the laboratory development and testing of                             
              microcomputer-based applications to improve the physics                        
              laboratory experience and further enhance the students'                        
              critical thinking skills.  Our objectives are to: (1) modernize                
              performance of certain traditional experiments, (2) provide a                  
              platform for Introducing certain cognitive based learning                      
              experiences, (3) stimulate learning and creative thinking by                   
              the use of numerical based open-ended simulation exercises, and                
              (4) expose students to emerging physics based technologies                     
              important to their curricula. Our objectives are being                         
              accomplished by the creation of a "state of the art" fully                     
              networked Macintosh based physics lab.  Eight (8) workstations                 
              have been set up in the physics laboratory and are being used                  
              to accomplish our objectives.  New laboratories and                            
              instructional techniques are being developed to integrate the                  
              latest in Engineering Physics, General Physics, Descriptive                    
              Astronomy, and Photographic Science technologies.  Our long                    
              range goal is to develop a multi-disciplinary course structure                 
              to meet the emerging demands of our four-year transfer                         
              institutions.
