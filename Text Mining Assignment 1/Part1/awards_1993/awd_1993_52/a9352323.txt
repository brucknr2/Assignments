Abstract    :
              The addition of an SEM and ancillary equipment allows modern                   
              morphological instruction to be incorporated into the                          
              curriculum at all levels.  The SEM most significantly enhances                 
              the curriculum by providing a three-dimensional perspective of                 
              tissue, cell, and intracellular structure, and thereby                         
              complements the more traditional two-dimensional data.                         
              The SEM provides a unique component in that it is directly used                
              by undergraduates enrolled in the Cell Biology, Microtechnique,                
              and Electron Microscopy courses.  Moreover, students who have                  
              successfully completed the three courses noted above, are                      
              encouraged to utilize the SEM in their research projects, also                 
              an integral element of the Biology program.
