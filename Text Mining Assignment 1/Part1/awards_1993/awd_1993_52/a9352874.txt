Abstract    :
              9352874  Beatrous  A technology enhanced calculus courses is being established
              at  two campuses of the University of Pittsburgh. The approach  adopted in the
              University courses is based on the Calculus &  Mathematica (C&M) project
              developed at the University of  Illinois by H. Porta and J. Uhl and at Ohio
              State University by  W. Davis. Pilot courses using C&U have been taught at the 
              University of Pittsburgh since the Spring of 1991. The CALC-  TECH project will
              facilitate large scale implementation of the  C&M project on the two University
              campuses.  This will require  workshops for faculty and graduate teaching
              assistants,  development of materials, and evaluation.
