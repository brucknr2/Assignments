Abstract    :
              Mathematics Department at SUNY College of Agriculture and                      
              Technology at Cobleskill is establishing a computer                            
              laboratory/classroom for regular class scheduling of all                       
              precalculus and calculus classes. This classroom is allowing                   
              students to learn mathematics using a "hands-on" approach.                     
              The Harvard Calculus Consortium Project materials are being                    
              used to teach Calculus I and II at Cobleskill.  Selected                       
              exercises from the Harvard materials are also supplementing the                
              precalculus classes while other precalculus lessons are being                  
              written or modified from other projects. The faculty are                       
              attempting to modernize all of their course outlines by using                  
              the types of presentations and exercises given in the Harvard                  
              materials. While no specific technology is required for these                  
              materials, this project is creating a computer                                 
              laboratory/classroom that includes the CAS software Derive.                    
              Such software allows the student to do numerical problems,                     
              graphs, and closed-form algebra and calculus very efficiently.                 
              Thus, the students are learning by doing mathematics throughout                
              the class instead of just watching the teacher. In addition,                   
              the computers are available for in-class and out-of-class                      
              laboratory projects. These projects are designed to present                    
              "real" mathematical situations.
