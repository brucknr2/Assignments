Abstract    :
              9352141  McKenna  Two diode array spectrophotometry systems are being used in a 
              project that is providing an integrative laboratory experience  for students in
              general, organic, advanced analytical and  biological chemistry.  Because we
              believe that kinetics is a  key concept which should be addressed in courses
              throughout the  curriculum, kinetics is being used as a unifying concept to 
              reinforce the idea that each course in the chemistry curriculum  builds on
              skills learned in previous courses.  Students in the  various courses are
              performing a series of increasingly  sophisticated investigations on the
              kinetics of the hydrolysis  reaction of the digestive protease trypsin, using 
              spectrophotometric and synthetic techniques and molecular  modeling.    ***
