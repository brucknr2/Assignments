Abstract    :
              Modern equipment will substantially enhance the nature of                      
              undergraduate Astronomy observing labs at the introductory                     
              level. It is absolutely vital to update antiquated equipment so                
              that Astronomy is not perceived as an old, drab science without                
              innovation. The project centers on student use of modern light                 
              detectors (CCDs) and image processing techniques which closely                 
              match what the professional does. Much of the thrill,                          
              motivation and excitement of science comes from discovery. A                   
              variety of observational exercises, using this modern                          
              equipment, are oriented towards projects which emphasize the                   
              discovery aspects of Astronomy. To meet these objectives, a                    
              wide field imaging system is used so that a single CCD exposure                
              images 1-4 square degrees of sky. With similar systems,                        
              students are able to image a wide variety of astronomical                      
              targets. These new labs represent an exciting addition to the                  
              traditional textbook curriculum. Such labs should increase the                 
              scientific and computer literacy of undergraduate and allow                    
              them to understand more effectively the coupling between                       
              instrumentation and computers, and motivate them to pursue a                   
              career in science by emphasizing the process of discovery and                  
              the relationship between data and scientific model making.
