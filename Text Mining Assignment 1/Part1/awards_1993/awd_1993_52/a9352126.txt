Abstract    :
              This project will implement change in the design of experiments                
              for first and second year biology and chemistry courses by                     
              introducing the capability to conceptualize and visualize                      
              structures and transformations in three dimensions. The design                 
              will engage students in experiments which connect lectures and                 
              laboratory and which reflect the intellectual and laboratory                   
              practices of life scientists and chemists.  Students will study                
              biological material or chemical in two ways.  The student will                 
              analyze the molecular structure using computer-based tools and                 
              also manipulate the same material in laboratory.  The                          
              instruments which provide the capability for viewing and                       
              analysis of molecualr structure are molecular visualization                    
              software running on high-resolution graphics personal computers                
              and molecular models, as requested in this proposal.
