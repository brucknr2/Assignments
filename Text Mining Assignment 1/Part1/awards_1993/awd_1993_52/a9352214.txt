Abstract    :
              This project enables students to conduct independent research                  
              on Sandhill crane courtship and mating displays in a                           
              naturalistic setting. This research opportunity is unrivaled                   
              due to the natural concentration of upwards of 200,000 cranes                  
              in the immediate area every spring. Students conduct research                  
              on proximal cues used by the cranes for pair formation by using                
              event recorders and spotting scopes in the field. Vocal                        
              behaviors are recorded on a Uher tape recorder using a long                    
              distance microphone. Both types of data are then analyzed in                   
              the laboratory on a computer by running specialized analysis                   
              software for time-series event-recording data and for vocal                    
              data. In the course of this project, students also develop an                  
              appreciation for the different types of questions answerable by                
              laboratory and field research.
