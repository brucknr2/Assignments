Abstract    :
              9352680  Nyhof  In support of developing an investigative approach to the 
              physiology laboratory, the equipment requested in this project  will permit
              students to systematically study physiological  phenomena by forming
              hypotheses, devising the means to test  these hypotheses, systematically
              collecting the data, and  mathematically analyzing the data for critical
              evaluation. In  addition, students will experience a greater degree of hands-on
               experimentation in the laboratory activities using the  independent data
              acquisition stations.  The equipment request is for computers using versatile 
              recording and analysis software. To interface with the  computers are signal
              amplifiers, force transducers, and  respiratory volume measuring equipment.
              Related laboratory  equipment will provide temperature regulation for isolated 
              tissue and capabilities to measure metabolic activity in  different types of
              isolated tissue. This equipment will provide  the opportunity for students to
              develop detailed investigations  into many aspects of both human and animal
              physiology using  state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. The versatility of the
               equipment will encourage student experimentation by greatly  expanding the
              range of techniques currently possible and will  foster more systematic
              evaluation of the data collected.     ***
