Abstract    :
              9352631  McShane  Based on the success of our students in learning electronics
              in  the course of their research projects, the introductory  electronics
              program has been revised to provide a similar  contextual setting. Experience
              in a goal-oriented project  environment enables students both to learn more
              effectively and  to make significant research contributions much earlier than 
              previously.  From the beginning of the course the students are involved with 
              the type of modern instruments they will use at various levels  in the larger
              community: with their fellow students in upper-  division laboratories, with
              local industry, and at several  national laboratories and CERN.  Two sets of
              equipment are utilized. The first set is used for  learning the basic
              fundamentals and building blocks of  electronic devices. In this category is a
              digital storage  oscilloscope controlled by a microcomputer. The computer also 
              controls a multifunction I/O board, and programs for analysis  and simulation.
              The second set is used for student projects.  This category comprises
              specialized equipment in the areas of  communication, data acquisition, and
              control. Included here are  microcontroller modules joined to other and
              supervised over a  microcomputer link.  ***
