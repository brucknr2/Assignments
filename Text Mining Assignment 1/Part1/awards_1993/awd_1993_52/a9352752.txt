Abstract    :
              9352752  Clayton     The project will purchase a high field nuclear magnetic 
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer to enable its students to fully  learn modern
              chemical methods. The instrument will be used at  all levels of the curriculum
              and its use will lead students  progressively to a more sophisticated
              understanding of the  power of the NMR method.  In the descriptive inorganic
              course,  students will experience the utility of multinuclear NMR and  learn to
              apply the method for the determination of physical  properties. In the physical
              chemistry laboratory, the  spectrometer will be used to determine kinetic
              parameters, thus  illustrating the application of NMR to time dependent 
              phenomena. A rich array of advanced NMR techniques will be  featured in the
              upper level chemistry courses including  multinuclear methods, quantitative
              analysis, relaxation time  techniques, and two-dimensional methods.   The
              instrument will  have regional impact as well.   ***
