Abstract    :
              Computer based data acquisition and testing is becoming                        
              more and more prevalent in the field of electronics. Presently                 
              the electronic technology equipment at Nassau Community College                
              consists exclusively of discrete, non-computerized measuring                   
              instruments. The project is incorporating data acquisition into                
              the Electronics program at Nassau Community College through                    
              upgrading one of their two electrical measuring labs by the                    
              incorporation of state of the art computer-based "virtual"                     
              instruments. Students using this lab are being exposed to the                  
              concept of computer based data acquisition and computerized                    
              data analysis over the two years they are in the electronics                   
              program. The project builds the integration of the data                        
              acquisition equipment and analysis programs into every                         
              electronics course containing a laboratory portion. The                        
              students knowledge of data acquisition and analysis is being                   
              gradually expanded semester by semester as new aspects in this                 
              area are presented. Upon completion of the program the project                 
              equipment will allow the student to have a thorough                            
              understanding of data acquisition.
