Abstract    :
              9352483  Pesterfield  An FT-NMR multi-element broadband frequency 
              synthesizer/controller, a F-l9/H-l dual oscillator, a magnetic  susceptibility
              balance, two vacuum manifold rack systems, and  the necessary vacuum manifold
              accessories are being used  alongside our existing FT-NMR, FT-IR, and UV-VIS 
              instrumentation as the basis for a new synthesis/physical  methods inorganic
              laboratory/lecture course.  The course  experiments are focusing on the
              synthesis and manipulation of  inorganic compounds, and their characterization
              by physical  methods.  Further, the equipment is being utilized in our 
              physical chemistry and advanced organic chemistry laboratory  courses, and in
              an advanced physics course.  ***
