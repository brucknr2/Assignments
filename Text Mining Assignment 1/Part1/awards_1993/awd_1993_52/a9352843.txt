Abstract    :
              9352843  Phillips    The Harvard Consortium Curriculum is being implemented
              throughout  the Calculus courses, from beginning through Multivariate, in the 
              context of a thorough revision of our first-year and remedial  classes.  This
              involves adapting the Harvard curriculum to meet the  needs of a diverse
              student population, who fall into three  categories: the 1600 students a year
              who take the first term of the  Precalculus/Calculus sequence, for whom the
              precalculus end of the  curriculum needs to be expanded; the 900 who take
              either the slow-  stream or the mainstream Calculus, who can use the curriculum
               essentially in its present form, and a smaller number of well-  prepared
              students, who took some Calculus in high school, and would  benefit from
              enrichment material to supplement the more routine  sections of the curriculum.
               Undergraduate majors interested in secondary teaching are being  recruited to
              participate in workshops and seminars offered as part  of the project and to
              gain teaching experience in the revamped  precalculus and calculus courses.
