Abstract    :
              Computing Equipment to Enhance Inquiry-Oriented Laboratory                     
              Instruction in Biology at a 2-year College                                     
              The goals of this project are to facilitate the acquisition of                 
              biology concepts and cognitive skills in beginning biology                     
              students.  Inquiry-oriented laboratory instruction of nonmajor,                
              introductory biology students to include weekly computer                       
              applications are featured.  The course is based on a 3-phase                   
              sequence of instruction including exploration, term                            
              introduction, and application.  Traditional hands-on                           
              exploration activities, are supplemented with computer                         
              simulations.
