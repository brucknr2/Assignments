Abstract    :
              9352401  Baker  Undergraduate Laboratory for Geographic Information Systems 
              This project is developing a laboratory for undergraduate  instruction in
              geographic information systems (GIS). The  laboratory has a file server, a set
              of workstations and  graphics terminals, plus peripherals to enable
              high-quality  input and output of maps and other data. The lab provides 
              extensive hands-on experience in basic and advanced  undergraduate courses in
              GIS for both majors and students from  other disciplines. The equipment and
              software exposes  undergraduate students to advanced vector-type GIS software, 
              input of large maps and spatial data, analysis procedures, and  innovative
              methods of display and visualization of spatial  data. The lab also hosts
              demonstrations for introductory  courses in geography, and is available for
              other departments  and for student projects in cartography and remote sensing.
