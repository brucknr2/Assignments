Abstract    :
              \9352396  Van Willis  The project will provide funds for the acquisition of an
              atomic  absorption spectrophotometer.  The instrument will be used in  the
              laboratory courses at all curricular levels from  introductory non-science
              labs, through quantitative and  instrumental analysis, to the senior research
              program. The AAS  will play an important role in the environmental chemistry 
              program, where it will be one of the principal tools used to  teach the
              determination and interpretation of metal  concentrations in environmental
              samples.  ***
