Abstract    :
              A principal aim of this project is to assess the stability of                  
              a local wetland and to promote awareness of the need to                        
              preserve wetland ecosystems. Studies of this wetland ecosystem,                
              therefore, are determining population densities and are                        
              providing data on diversity. We have recently added a course in                
              field biology to our curriculum and students in this course                    
              also participate directly in the research. Videotapes                          
              describing the life of the wetland are also being produced for                 
              use by the community. It is expected that the project will                     
              provide additional education opportunities such as cooperative                 
              learning and independent study.
