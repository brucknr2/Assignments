Abstract    :
              9352081  Simone      A series of computer-simulated, animated physiology experi-
               ments, created by the project director and named Physiofinder,  are dedicated
              to critical thinking.  Physiofinder, which is  Hypercard and Macromind
              Director-based, is directed at several  problems in the existing Human
              Physiology lab (200 students per  annum), including: 1) a growing reluctance of
              students to  participate in life-sacrificing experiments, 2) health concerns 
              relating to use of biological fluids, and 3) the difficulties,  deriving from
              lack of equipment and expertise, that often make  it impossible to successfully
              conduct certain highly  educational experiments in the introductory physiology
              lab.   MacIntosh LC II computers are being used with the software to  enhance
              the teaching of Human Physiology.  ***y
