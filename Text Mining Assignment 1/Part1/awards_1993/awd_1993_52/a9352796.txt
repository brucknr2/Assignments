Abstract    :
              9352796  Makedon  Parallelism is the future of computing and computer science
              and  should therefore be at the heart of the CS curriculum. Instead  of
              continuing along the evolutionary path by introducing  parallel computation
              "top down" (first in special junior-senior  level courses), this radical
              approach will introduce  parallelism at the earliest possible stages of
              instruction.  Specifically, a completely new freshman-level course on data 
              structures that integrates parallel computation naturally, and  retains the
              emphasis on laboratory instruction will be  developed. This will help to steer
              the curriculum as  expeditiously as possible toward parallel computing, and 
              provide a national model for other schools to do the same. It  will also serve
              to meet as directly as possible the national  need identified in the HPCC
              initiative to transfer knowledge of  high performance computing as quickly as
              possible into  education. This approach is novel in three distinct and 
              essential ways. First, parallel computing will be taught to  freshmen in a
              course designed from beginning to end to do so.  Second, the course will be
              motivating with examples from  scientific computation. Third, multimedia and
              visualization  will be used as instructional aids to produce a seamless, 
              exploratory environment. The three primary objectives are: 1)  to begin a
              reform of the undergraduate curriculum with an  innovative, laboratory-based,
              freshman course on parallel  computation, 2) to provide a model for national
              use, and 3) to  produce tools and methodologies that improve student 
              understanding of the basic principles of parallel computing  that can be
              disseminated to other schools.  ***
