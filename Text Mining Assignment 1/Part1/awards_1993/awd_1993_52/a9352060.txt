Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is implementing an extensively revised                
              sequence of introductory courses at the freshman level, along                  
              with major revisions in its laboratory experiments throughout                  
              the four year curriculum.  Modern instrumental techniques are                  
              being discussed in freshman classes and introduced into the                    
              laboratory at appropriate times.  In order for magnetic                        
              resonance techniques to become an integral part of this                        
              sequence of laboratory experiments, a 300 MHz broadband FT NMR                 
              spectrometer is being added to the available equipment.                        
              Background for NMR is being introduced at the freshman level by                
              focusing on the concept of equivalent nuclei during the                        
              discussion of bonding in organic compounds, and the NMR itself                 
              is being used by all organic chemistry students.  A series of                  
              coordinated experiments are being used as stepping stones in                   
              the development of NMR in the lab curriculum, beginning with                   
              the traditional structural identifications in the 2nd year,                    
              progressing through more sophisticated multi--pulse and 2-D                    
              experiments, including a molecular dynamics study and multi--                  
              nuclear use, and culminating for many students in the                          
              utilization of the NMR in their senior research projects.
