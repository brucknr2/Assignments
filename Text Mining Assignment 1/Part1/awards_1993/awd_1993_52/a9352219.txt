Abstract    :
              9352219  Wahl   The purpose of this grant is to develop a curriculum in 
              software engineering that focuses on testing, maintenance, and  reliability. A
              software testing laboratory will be developed to  provide an environment
              conducive to teaching, learning, and  experimenting in these critical but often
              neglected areas. The  testing laboratory will support increased emphasis on 
              undergraduate instruction in testing and maintenance. A  sequence of two
              software engineering courses is proposed. The  second course in the sequence
              will be devoted to teaching  testing and maintenance principles relating to
              verification,  validation, reliability, debugging, reverse engineering, 
              restructuring, and enhancement of software. The testing  laboratory will
              consist of a network of 5 UNIX-based RISC  stations. The workstations will be
              used by students in the  software engineering courses and students in a
              capstone  projects course through ongoing experimentation in reliability, 
              testing and maintenance techniques. By developing a model  curriculum focusing
              on the later phases of the software  development life-cycle, the project will
              provide a model for  software engineering education in the areas of testing and
               maintenance.  ***
