Abstract    :
              In line with the recommendation for integrated laboratory                      
              experience of the ACS Committee of Professional Training we                    
              wish to unify the determination of molecular dimensions using                  
              viscometry, light scattering and chromatographic techniques so                 
              the students can have a better understanding of these very                     
              important properties. We will purchase  a Laser Light                          
              Scattering Instrument as part of an integrated macromolecular                  
              characterization instrumentation that will enable the direct                   
              measurement of molecular dimensions of a polymer sample. By                    
              this instrument acquisition our abilities to teach a revised                   
              Polymer Science Laboratory Course, concerned with polymer                      
              synthesis and characterization will be substantially enhanced.
