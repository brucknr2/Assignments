Abstract    :
              Students are utilizing the concepts of Calculus to solve applied               
              problems in both Calculus and Physics. The instructional approaches            
              are modeled after the methods developed by Priscilla Laws, Ron                 
              Thornton, Alan Van Heuvelan, David Maloney, and others, to teach               
              Physics. The approaches also involve stressing the graphical,                  
              numerical, and analytical aspects of Calculus in keeping with the              
              ideas forwarded by the Harvard Based Calculus Consortium.  An                  
              important aspect of this method of teaching is a set of short,                 
              simple conceptual experiments whose outcomes are recorded and                  
              graphed in real-time by a computer.  Concepts are first developed              
              qualitatively using experiments and their graphs, then                         
              quantitatively through mathematical representation of physical                 
              phenomena, and finally with overview case study problems.
