Abstract    :
              9352520  Meadows  A Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) for Great Lakes undergraduate 
              laboratory education is serving a broad, undergraduate  population with the
              goal of producing high quality engineering  and science students with the tools
              necessary to attack the  serious issues facing the marine environment.  The ROV
              is  receiving a wide interdisciplinary use in the education of  students across
              the breadth of the institution.  Technological  development in new areas such
              as ocean exploration requires the  training of engineers and scientists with
              capabilities to  adequately attack new and challenging problems.  Similarly, 
              major future breakthroughs in all areas of oceanography will be  made by
              detailed understanding of ecosystems and their  interrelationships.  An
              important role in this effort and in  the development of appropriate
              undergraduate curricula is being  played by the selective sampling and
              inspection capabilities  provided by vehicles such as this ROV.  The equipment
              and  facilities necessary to support the proposed ROV operations  include the
              Ship Hydrodynamics Laboratory (SHL) and the  University of Michigan's Research
              Vessel Laurentian which  operates in the Great Lakes as part of the NSF/UNOLS
              Fleet.  ***
