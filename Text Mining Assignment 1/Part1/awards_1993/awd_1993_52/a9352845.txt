Abstract    :
              9352845  Marlin                                   An experience-based,
              application-driven, two-year calculus sequence  involving 50 faculty members,
              50 graduate teaching assistants, and  over 4,000 undergraduate mathematics,
              science and engineering  majors each semester is being developed.The three year
              plan  includes to revitalizing undergraduate calculus curricula and 
              instructional techniques through curriculum enhancement,  experiential computer
              laboratories, and intensive faculty  development. The aim of the plan is to
              empower any capable and  willing undergraduate student to succeed in calculus
              and  differential equations, and to encourage advanced study in applied 
              mathematics. A team-based approach to curriculum and assessment  development,
              involving faculty from client disciplines, is focusing  on applications of
              mathematics and the use of technology to  illustrate the central importance of
              calculus in engineering and  science. The project demonstrates innovative
              adaptations of small-  scale models previously developed by others, in addition
              to a new  set of curriculum enhancements emphasizing applications in other 
              disciplines, which may be adopted or further adapted at  institutions of any
              size.
