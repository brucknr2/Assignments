Abstract    :
              Four New Brunswick Bioflow III bench top fermentors along with                 
              software and a microcomputer facilitate instruction in                         
              fermentation engineering. Projects and experiments in eight                    
              classes instruct students in the fundamentals of fermentor                     
              design, operation, and day-to-day maintenance. Students also                   
              use  the fermentors for independent projects.
