Abstract    :
              This project seeks to enhance the application of modeling                      
              techniques that support full implementation of computer-                       
              integrated manufacturing. The curricular areas primarily                       
              affected are the Manufacturing Technology program and the                      
              Electro-Mechanical Systems program. The four key areas of                      
              coursework will be impacted directly range from freshman-level                 
              studies of automated manufacturing to senior-level research                    
              projects. The University has been supportive in program                        
              development especially through the establishment of computer                   
              laboratories in the Industrial Technology Center. Students gain                
              experience with key software applications in numerous areas                    
              including computer-aided design (CAD), numerical control                       
              programming, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), process                       
              planning, cost estimating, statistical process control and                     
              computer simulation.                                                           
              This proposal seeks support for phase-one of a two-phase plan                  
              to upgrade the automated manufacturing laboratory facilities.                  
              Phase one establishes an automated manufacturing cell using                    
              industry-standard benchtop CNC machine tools with robot                        
              material handling and vision system for automated inspection.                  
              The cell would also serve as a focal point for student                         
              application of simulation and SPC techniques. Phase two would                  
              expand the cell to create a flexible manufacturing system (FMS)                
              including ASRS, palletized automated conveyor and bar code I.D.
