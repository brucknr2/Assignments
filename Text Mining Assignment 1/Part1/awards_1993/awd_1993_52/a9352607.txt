Abstract    :
              9352607  Veening                              This project will incorporate the
              use of Capillary Electrophoresis  (CE) into the undergraduate curriculum as an
              important instrumental  tool in chemical and biological research. It will be
              applied to the  identification of pollutants in environmental water samples,
              the  separation of complex proteins and amino acids, and analysis of 
              metabolites. This project will introduce this state-of-the-art  technique to
              students through laboratory exercises and through  undergraduate research
              projects.
