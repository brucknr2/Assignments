Abstract    :
              The project will purchase equipment to assemble two complete,                  
              self contained vacuum line systems and design experiments to                   
              incorporate their usage specifically into the Advanced                         
              Synthesis Laboratory. It will also incorporate their usage into                
              the Advanced Inorganic Chemistry and Organometallic Chemistry                  
              courses, and to encourage student research using the equipment.                
              Students will learn the techniques for manipulation of air-                    
              sensitive compounds and their applications to industrial and                   
              academic experimentation.
