Abstract    :
              9352329  Alexander  The University of Mississippi's Department of Mathematics is
               implementing a new calculus curriculum, Project CALC (Calculus  As a
              Laboratory Course). The University is the first  comprehensive public
              university utilizing materials and methods  of Project CALC, developed and
              first implemented at Duke  University. After extensive review of its
              mathematics  curriculum, the Department selected Project CALC to test as an 
              alternative curriculum and teaching strategy in the  undergraduate curriculum.
              Project CALC is an innovative  calculus program which emphasizes more
              applications, numerical  and graphical techniques, modeling, use of current
              technology,  and collaborative learning. After the initial one year trial 
              period, the Department is pursuing implementation of Project  CALC in all of
              its calculus sections.  The objectives of this  project are: 1) to enable
              continuation of a phased  implementation of Project CALC at the University of 
              Mississippi, 2) to refine the materials and implementation  strategy where
              necessary to better suit the environment at a  comprehensive state university,
              3) to afford students an  opportunity to have an innovative and exciting new
              learning  experience; especially underrepresented minorities, for whom  the
              strategies of Project CALC seem to be particularly  successful, and 4) to share
              with the broader mathematical  community experiences in order to facilitate
              calculus reform in  environments similar to the University of Mississippi. This
               project ties in closely with the Mississippi Alliance for  Minority
              Participation.  ***
