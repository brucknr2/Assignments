Abstract    :
              9352539  Radak       This project will purchase a HPLC for use in the teaching
              of  organic chemistry, analytical chemistry as well as other  related fields. 
              Emphasis will be on practical applications as  well as training for those
              students who will enter the  industrial sector as technicians. The technical
              training would  emphasize both the job related basic skills of being able to 
              operate a variety of modern laboratory equipment, as would be  expected of a
              technician, in addition to the basic research  skills needed for a student to
              successfully pursue a  professional degree in science.   ***
