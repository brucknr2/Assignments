Abstract    :
              The project involves acquisition of a modern, rapid scan CW NMR                
              spectrometer to provide students across the curriculum with greatly            
              increased opportunities to gain hands-on experience with an                    
              instrument that plays a fundamental and pivotal role in any modern             
              chemical laboratory. The instrument will also have a substantial               
              educational impact on the Advanced Chemical Analysis, the Physical             
              Chemical, the Advanced Inorganic Laboratory, the Chemical                      
              Spectroscopy and the Biological Biochemistry courses.    The                   
              acquisition will allow enrichment of existing experiments and                  
              development of new instructional exercises.
