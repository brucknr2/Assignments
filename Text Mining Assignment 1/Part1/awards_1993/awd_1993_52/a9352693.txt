Abstract    :
              9352693  Simmons  This project will support an emerging interdisciplinary Center
               for Scientific Visualization (CSV) currently being built upon  existing
              expertise and resources of the Departments of  Mathematics and Computer
              Science, Manufacturing Engineering and  Art. The Scientific Visualization
              Laboratory will also serve  the Undergraduate programs in Water Resources
              Management,  Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and eventually, the social  sciences.
              An advisory council with members from organizations  such as IBM, MIT and
              Carnegie Mellon University has been  assembled to provide guidance for the
              development. The primary  objectives of the CSV Laboratory are as follows: 1)
              support  undergraduate courses requiring advanced computer graphics,  image
              processing and visualization techniques; 2) provide an  environment for
              multiple disciplines to work together as  science teams; 3) conduct
              undergraduate and faculty research  projects requiring advanced visualization
              techniques; 4) serve  as a testbed to develop new visualization mechanisms to
              aid in  teaching difficult mathematical, scientific and engineering  concepts.
