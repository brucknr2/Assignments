Abstract    :
              9352407  Rubinson    The project will purchase a gas chromatography/mass 
              spectrometry instrumentation for use in their undergraduate  courses.  These
              include the courses taught in the organic  sequence, intermediate analytical
              chemistry, instrumental  analysis, biochemistry and undergraduate research. 
              There will  also be cooperative sessions with one of the local technical 
              colleges in their science technology curriculum. The instrument  will allow
              students to acquire an appreciation of the  possibilities for use and the
              limitations of GC/MS  instrumentation. The proposed project work will result in
              a  series of new experiments to be used in the undergraduate  curriculum.
