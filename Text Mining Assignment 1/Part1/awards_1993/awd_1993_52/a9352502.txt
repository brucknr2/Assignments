              93525502  Woods  Diode Array Spectrophotometers for Rapid Kinetics              
                  The project will purchase diode array spectophotometers to  measure sapid
              knetics in the undergraduate biochemistry course.  New experiments will be
              centered about enzymatic kinetics with  data collection required at less than
              second intervals.  The  rates of formation and degradation of reactants,
              intermediates,  and products will be determined.  ***y
