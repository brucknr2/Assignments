Abstract    :
              A network of X-terminals and workstations linked to  Zephyr                    
              satellite data receiving systems allow the interactive display                 
              and analysis of weather data in classroom activities. Both                     
              historical data ('Weather Disk' CD-ROM) and current daily                      
              weather data (UNIDATA channel) are available. Specific                         
              activities  include review of the daily weather maps, as well                  
              as synoptic and dynamic weather elements. Also, vertical                       
              temperature profiles, isopleth mapping, evolution of weather                   
              patterns, and statistical forecast evaluation is quickly                       
              obtained through the use of the graphics workstations. This                    
              project also allows teaching of a new Honors section focusing                  
              on modeling. This gives students a better understanding of                     
              atmospheric science, weather analysis, and forecasting. They                   
              also investigate specific phenomena using historical data.
