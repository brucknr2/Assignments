Abstract    :
              9352798  Hazelewood                                                         This
              proposal is for the acquisition of a parallel computing unit  to support
              laboratory assignments for undergraduates in the  Departments of Computer
              Science and Mathematics. Modules including  lab assignments will be developed
              for inclusion in eight existing  courses together with the development of a new
              undergraduate course  in parallel computing. Software usable in closed lab
              sessions will  be generated as a product of undergraduate research projects.
              Where  appropriate, a portable interface will be used to facilitate the  use of
              laboratory software in other computing environments. The  proposed parallel
              configuration will interface with equipment on  hand to support open and closed
              laboratory sessions, timings on a  dedicated machine, and undergraduate
              research.  ***
