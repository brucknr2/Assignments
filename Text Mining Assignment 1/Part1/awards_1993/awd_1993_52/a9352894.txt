Abstract    :
              The goals of this fifteen-month project are to design and implement            
              a curriculum for the critical first year of calculus at                        
              comprehensive universities and two-year colleges. The program                  
              adapts and synthesizes methods from successful calculus reform                 
              efforts and is crafted to meet local needs.                                    
              The curriculum stresses and facilitates cooperative learning,                  
              develops visual thinking with the aid of interactive graphing                  
              technology, and uses writing to help students learn and communicate            
              mathematics. These methods are integrated in an environment that               
              focuses on the central ideas of calculus and provides a progression            
              of problems and projects to challenge students while improving                 
              their confidence and study skills.                                             
              The project establishes a collaborative partnership among Sam                  
              Houston State University, North Harris College, San Jacinto College            
              Central, and Tomball College.  Two faculty members from each of                
              these four institutions will serve as site leaders.  All eight site            
              leaders will meet regularly to share ideas, experiences, and                   
              materials.  A volume of student assignments will be compiled to                
              serve as a resource for college faculty across the nation.
