Abstract    :
              The project involves the implemention of an integrated or                      
              common laboratory to be used by engineering students in their                  
              introductory mathematics, physics, and engineering courses. The                
              proposed laboratory is part of a novel curriculum revision                     
              experiment which is being funded separately as part of the NSF                 
              sponsored SUCCEED program.                                                     
              The planned curriculum revisions address critical issues in the                
              restructuring of the undergraduate engineering curriculum and                  
              a new experimental model for undergraduate engineering                         
              education is developed. In particular, a new model for                         
              integrating mathematics, physics, and introductory engineering                 
              at the critical freshman year is being implemented. The project                
              seeks to develop an early exposure to engineering and an                       
              emphasis on the common knowledge base from mathematics,                        
              physics, and the engineering method at the freshman year.                      
              Innovative features of the  integrated teaching approach                       
              include: (1) a flexible hours per week distribution concept                    
              between mathematics, physics, and engineering, (2)                             
              implementation of "just-in-time" learning concepts between the                 
              three subject areas and, (3) a common computer- oriented                       
              laboratory for the three subject areas.
