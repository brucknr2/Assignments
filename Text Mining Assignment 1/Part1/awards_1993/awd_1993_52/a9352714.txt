Abstract    :
              Organic chemistry and biochemistry students will construct,                    
              manipulate, and analyze computer generated visual models of                    
              chemical systems on a frequent and routine basis. These                        
              exercises will make use of computer-based molecular modeling                   
              tools and compatible chemistry modeling software.  The                         
              workstations will enable faculty to lead modeling sessions for                 
              large groups of students, and will ensure easy access for                      
              students engaged in independent modeling exercises.  This                      
              project is unique because it does not view computational                       
              chemistry as an end in itself. Rather, state-of-the-art                        
              computational techniques will be used to develop student                       
              "chemical intuition", and to provide a means for employing                     
              modeling, with an emphasis on structure visualization and                      
              analysis, as a learning activity.
