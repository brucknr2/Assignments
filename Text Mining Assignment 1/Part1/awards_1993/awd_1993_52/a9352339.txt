Abstract    :
              Experiments follow from a single question posed at the                         
              beginning of the course: How is gene expression regulated? In                  
              order to answer this question students learn the standard                      
              techniques of biotechnology: bacterial culture, DNA                            
              purification, restriction and ligation of DNA, transformation                  
              of competent cells, Southern transfer, polymerase chain                        
              reaction, preparation and labeling of probes, chemiluminescent                 
              detection, in vitro mutagenesis, DNA sequencing, protein                       
              electrophoresis and Western blotting. The continuity of the                    
              experiments illustrate and emphasize the sequential nature of                  
              scientific inquiry.   Many important biochemical and genetic                   
              concepts are highlighted while students simultaneously practice                
              their investigative skills and develop their technical skills.
