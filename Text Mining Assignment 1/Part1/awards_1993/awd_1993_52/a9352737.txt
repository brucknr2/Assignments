Abstract    :
              A comprehensive molecular biology laboratory facility enhances                 
              an  undergraduate molecular biology course, a molecular biology                
              course for in-service high school teachers, and genetics and                   
              introductory biology courses.  There is great student                          
              independence in the laboratory, and a focused approach to gene                 
              isolation and sequencing.
