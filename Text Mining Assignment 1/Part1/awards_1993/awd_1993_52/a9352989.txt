Abstract    :
              9352989  Narayan    SUNY College at Oswego  will initiate a four week summer 
              residential Early Alert project for 32 eighth graders.  The  disciplinary focus
              will be mathematics and physics. The project  challenges students to develop
              new ways of thinking about  mathematics and physics.  Exploratory sessions,
              workshops and   hands on activities will focus on such topics as: graph theory
              and  its applications, Logo, mathematical patterns in number theory   
              elementary mechanics, and the physics of light.  All students work  on group
              and individual projects  suitable for a regional science  fair.  Follow up
              activities include six Saturday workshops and  conferences.   ***
