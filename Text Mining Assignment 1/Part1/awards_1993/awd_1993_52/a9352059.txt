Abstract    :
              9352059  Myers                                     DCCC will establish a
              Math/Science Learning Lab to improve and  expand the teaching/learning
              processes of mathematics and science  by incorporating integrated computer
              technology into every course  of instruction. The lab will be used to present
              new material to  entire classes; stimulate advanced and independent study 
              activities; provide an environment to produce laboratory  stimulations; enable
              faculty to use more varied formative and  summative assessment techniques to
              monitor student progress;  implement specialized software programs for
              instruction; and shift  the emphasis of teaching to a more conceptual approach.
              An  important additional outcome of this technologically-advanced  learning
              environment will be to serve as a model to other  undergraduate institutions,
              particularly community colleges, in  creating new ways to stimulate and enhance
              learning in math and  science.
