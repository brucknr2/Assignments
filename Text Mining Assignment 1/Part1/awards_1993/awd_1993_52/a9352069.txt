Abstract    :
              9352069  Veath  The overall goal of this project is to provide authentic "real- 
              world" experiences in the physics curriculum.  Creation of an  observatory for
              undergraduate teaching and student research is  the mechanism for the
              implementation of this goal. Specifically  the project not only provide
              authentic experiences in a variety  of physics classes, but also institutes new
              quantitative  courses and opportunities for student research and senior 
              portfolios. Pre-service secondary teachers in a new course of  laboratory
              methods, design activities utilizing the new  technology for pre-service
              elementary teachers and non-majors,  thereby reducing their "technophobia".
              Working with  professional organizations like the American Association of 
              Variable Star Observers and International Amateur-Professional  Photoelectric
              Photometery, undergraduates engage in  observational astronomy program that
              result in professional  presentations of their results. Existing telescopes are
               upgraded by the addition of electronic digital setting circles  and integrated
              CCD imaging photometers.     ***
