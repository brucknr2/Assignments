Abstract    :
              State-of-the-art laboratory sequences in immunology, plant                     
              physiological ecology, cell physiology, biochemistry, and cell                 
              biology augment existing courses.  Innovative approaches to                    
              laboratory design include: Replacing radioactive tracers with                  
              either colorimetric or fluorescent assays; Miniaturizing                       
              experiments to reduce reagent use through the use of tissue                    
              culture and development of assays using the microplate reader;                 
              and Studies the effect of similar stress situations on varying                 
              plant physiological responses.
