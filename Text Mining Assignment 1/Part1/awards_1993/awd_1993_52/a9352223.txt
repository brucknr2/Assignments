Abstract    :
              An ultracentrifuge will be acquired to allow new laboratory                    
              experiences for undergraduates in molecular biology using                      
              isolated DNA, viral and plasmid vectors, and isolated                          
              organelles. The hands-on experience in molecular biology will                  
              be integrated into introductory and advanced courses in the                    
              biology program and will enhance laboratory experiences in new                 
              interdisciplinary courses. Students will benefit from the                      
              introduction of this technology into numerous courses and                      
              student research programs that develop critical thinking                       
              skills. The major use of this instrument will be to introduce                  
              students to the ultracentrifuge as a tool for the isolation of                 
              macromolecules or organelles. The students will become familiar                
              with the exploitation of the physical characteristics of                       
              macromolecules that are used to isolate those molecules.                       
              Students will also acquire the skills to manipulate                            
              macromolecules genetically. By combining chemical and genetic                  
              techniques students will appreciate the usefulness of multiple                 
              approaches to the dissection of biological processes.
