Abstract    :
              9352979  Karnawat    Turtle Mountain Community College will conduct a four week
              summer  commuter project in mathematics for thirty Native American high  school
              students.  Participants will learn to apply mathematical  ideas to engineering
              design.  Problems relevant to local industry  and the reservation will be
              studied using techniques from  probability and statistics.  The TI-82 graphing
              calculator will  be employed to analyze data.  Emphasis will be given to those 
              problems that are relevant to the Chippewa culture.  Field trips  to local
              universities and 9 Saturday follow-up meetings complete  the program.  ***
