Abstract    :
              9352767  Gibson  A computer laboratory with the  mathematics software, Theorist,
               is being developed to relieve students from difficult algebraic  calculations,
              thus enabling them to concentrate on concept  development and understanding. In
              addition, multimedia  presentations that explain and reinforce Calculus
              concepts in  an exciting manner are being developed to encourage student 
              interest and success. Five multimedia modules, on limit,  continuity,
              differentiation, integration and series that  explore, clarify and amplify
              concept understanding are being  developed. The modules are being developed to
              particularly meet  the needs of the divers student body; at least 50% of the 
              institution's students are non-native English speaking and  sixty-nine percent
              of incoming freshman place below standard  college entrance level in
              mathematics placement tests.  ***
