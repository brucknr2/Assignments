Abstract    :
              9352501  Henley                                                             This
              project provides a multi-purpose microcomputer laboratory (1)  to enhance
              teaching in experimental psychology; and (2) for the  learning of computer
              applications in the discipline. The  microcomputers, dynamic classroom display,
              and simulation software  form a laboratory which has significantly improved the
              teaching  environment for computer applications. The project has increased 
              students' access to basic microcomputer facilities, and to local  and remote
              computer networks. The project is also expected to  improve instructional
              capabilities in experimental psychology by  providing a laboratory facility for
              majors and, through the  innovative use of simulation software, provide direct
              experience  with the critical thinking, design, conduct, analysis, and 
              reporting of experiments not possible through the traditional lab  approach.
