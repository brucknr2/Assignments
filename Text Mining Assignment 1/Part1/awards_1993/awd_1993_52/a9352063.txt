Abstract    :
              This project affords undergraduate students in the animal                      
              sciences a unique opportunity to obtain experience in                          
              developing and applying a new technology, ultrasound, to solve                 
              problems in the livestock industries.  Students are introduced                 
              to the basics of ultrasound technology in a required meat                      
              animal evaluation course and are then given an opportunity to                  
              enroll in a study program consisting of intensive training in                  
              physical properties of the technology coupled with hands-on                    
              training in measuring and analyzing animals with the equipment.                
              After completion of a proficiency program and certification,                   
              students are available to producers for measurement and                        
              analysis of animals.  Undergraduate students are involved in                   
              research attempting to develop and apply high technology to                    
              agriculture problems.
