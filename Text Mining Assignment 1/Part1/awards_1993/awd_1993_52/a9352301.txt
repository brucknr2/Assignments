Abstract    :
              9352301  Craig       Design of Mechatronic Systems is the proposed
              senior-elective  course and laboratory for mechanical engineering 
              undergraduates. It builds on the current successful course,  Mechatronics, and
              focuses on mechatronic design. With the  support of industrial sponsors - real
              customers- student design  teams will design, build, and test a
              microprocessor-based  mechatronic system to satisfy the customer defined 
              problem/need.Funds are requested for course development and for  laboratory
              equipment. Course development will focus on  microprocessor instruction, the
              design process taught by  example, and design practice taught by scheduled
              written and  oral presentations, culminating with a prototype. The 
              testing/debugging equipment requested here is essential for  successful
              microprocessor-based design. They, together with the  current inventory of
              sensors, actuators, computers, and  microprocessors in the Mechatronics
              Laboratory, and the  project-specific equipment supplied by the industrial
              customer,  will give the student design teams all the tools necessary to  learn
              good mechatronic design methodology by experience and  produce winning
              designs.This course sequence represents the one  of the first known offerings
              in mechatronics at the  undergraduate level.  Aspects of course will also be
              modified  for collaborative use within the curriculum of Hudson Valley 
              Community College via instructor tutorials, transferred  laboratory and
              experimental procedures, shared resources and  student interaction. 
              Furthermore, the course and its  associated laboratory equipment will be used
              to attract 7th-  10th grade precollege students, especially women and 
              minorities, to engineering.  ***
