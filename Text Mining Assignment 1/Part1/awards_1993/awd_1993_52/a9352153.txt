Abstract    :
              9352153  Silver                                                                 
                      This project creates a computer-aided software engineering  (CASE)
              laboratory to promote the application of software  engineering practices. The
              current laboratory facilities are  inadequate for supporting full-lifecycle,
              CASE-oriented  software development. This severely constrains the complexity 
              of projects students can address and limits both their ability  to understand
              the need for this discipline and their exposure  to leading-edge technology.
              Undergraduates will use this  laboratory to create, document, and evaluate
              systems  specifications, software designs, code units and test cases for  a
              variety of large Ada artifacts. The CASE tools will increase  the productivity
              of student teams, increasing the size of  development or maintenance projects
              they can complete. The  laboratory will also support the creation of a
              repository of  reusable specifications, designs and code spanning several 
              generations of students. This will allow students to  participate in a project
              which otherwise would be too large to  complete in a single semester.
