Abstract    :
              9352889  Moore       The authors are developing interactive laboratory and
              classroom  materials to support follow-on courses for students completing 
              reformed calculus course:  linear algebra, differential equations,  and applied
              mathematical analysis.  A seven-member development  team, working at five
              different institutions over a two-year  period, will develop approximately 70
              interactive text modules.   Each module will be developed in one of the systems
              Mathcad 3.1,  Maple V, or Mathematica, and translated by student assistants to 
              each of the other two system.  This project will build on and reinforce the
              acquired concepts and  shared experiences of students moving on from reformed
              calculus  courses.  These students know how to work in a lab, how to work  with
              partners, and how to work on their own.  Moreover, they have  had introductions
              to many of the important ideas that will be  developed further in the follow-on
              courses.  Such students will  find conventional courses less than satisfactory
              as preparation for  their scientific or engineering careers in the 21st
              century.  The  modules to be developed by this project will enable students to 
              work with significant and realistic problems in a modern computer  environment
              that allows the to experiment to vary examples  endlessly, and to control the
              order and pace of their learning.
