Abstract    :
              Purchase of a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                         
              spectrometer will provide the basis for laboratory curriculum                  
              development in years 2, 3, and 4 of the undergraduate program.                 
              Following recent laboratory renovation and conversion to                       
              microscale experiments, new experiments will be introduced into                
              the sophomore organic laboratories which require the                           
              sensitivity and resolution of this high field instrument. In                   
              the senior organic course in qualitative organic analysis, a                   
              research component involving 2-D examination of earlier                        
              spectral assignments for complex molecules will be introduced.                 
              In the senior organometallics laboratory course, new                           
              experiments will utilize multinuclear NMR to characterize                      
              transition metal complexes and illustrate important concepts                   
              not possible to demonstrate with presently available equipment.                
              In physical chemistry laboratory, experiments involving gas                    
              phase kinetics as well as relaxation phenomena will be                         
              introduced. The instrument will also be used in a newly                        
              organized undergraduate research program.
