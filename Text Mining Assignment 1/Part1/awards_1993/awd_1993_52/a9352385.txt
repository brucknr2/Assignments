Abstract    :
              Semiconductor characterization experiments are being introduced                
              into the undergraduate physics curriculum at Macalester                        
              College.  These experiments are part of an innovative upper                    
              division laboratory class for physics majors in thin film and                  
              semiconductor physics.  They also provide opportunities for                    
              student independent study and faculty-student collaborative                    
              research.  The experiments being implemented as part of this                   
              activity are four-point probe measurements, Hall effect,                       
              transient photoconductivity, and pn junction current-voltage                   
              and capacitance measurements.  These experiments complement                    
              existing experiments in vacuum deposition science and                          
              technology, two-point conductivity measurements, optical                       
              absorption spectroscopy, steady-state photoconductivity, and                   
              solar cell spectral response. Together these experiments                       
              provide a comprehensive laboratory experience in experimental                  
              physics, through the vehicle of stimulating and topical                        
              experiments in materials physics.
