Abstract    :
              9352169  Smith-Baish  The proposed experiments allow students to:   1. measure
              magnetic fields;   2. numerically model electric and magnetic sources using a
              two-  dimensional finite-element program, and graphically represent  the
              electric and magnetic fields generated by these sources;  and   3. compare the
              experimental and theoretical magnetic field  measurements.   The specific
              experiments are:   1. to measure magnetic field exposures such as those due to 
              household appliances and distribution or transmission lines,   2. to calculate
              the electric and magnetic fields under  transmission lines,   3. to determine
              experimentally and numerically the magnetic  fields around different wiring
              configurations, (The design of  different devices such as electric blankets
              will be related to  this experiment.)   4. to determine experimentally and
              numerically the magnetic  fields around different types of motors, and   5. to
              calculate the electric field around and in a dielectric  sphere exposed to a
              given electric field. (This experiment  provides a model for a biological cell
              in an electric field and  the effect of the electric field on the cell.)  ***
