Abstract    :
              The primary purpose of this proposal is to design and implement                
              a Geographic Studies Center as a model geography laboratory for                
              Wyoming and northern Colorado. The Center will engender student                
              and teacher interest in geography by demonstrating ways in                     
              which technological advances (computer graphics, high-quality                  
              videodiscs) are creating new learning opportunities in this                    
              field. Students at Laramie County Community College will be the                
              most immediate beneficiaries of this laboratory facility, but                  
              it also will serve as an innovative model and inservice venue                  
              for educators and students throughout this region. Geography                   
              teachers from Laramie County, professors from the University of                
              Wyoming, and community college instructors will be involved in                 
              the design and implementation of the Geographic Studies Center.
