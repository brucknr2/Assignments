Abstract    :
              9352472  Lawrence  This project has established an instrumentation laboratory 
              to  enhance undergraduate geographic information systems (GIS)  instruction.
              The project also provides students with tools that  permit them to solve
              real-world problems, especially within a  team framework. The team approach
              will be especially beneficial  to students because GIS applications frequently
              require teams  of workers. A team strategy also broadens the view of students 
              as to the need for cooperation and to the contributions that  specialists in
              diverse fields can add to GIS applications. The  combination of a team
              oriented, problem solving approach and  quality hardware and software should
              also profit students when  they embark upon their careers in GIS.   ***
