Abstract    :
              Laboratory instruction is employing calculation and plotting as                
              means for exploration and learning in statistics. Also, the                    
              scientific content of undergraduate statistics curricula is                    
              being enriched with advances in statistical/mathematical                       
              computing and state-of-the-art computer intensive statistical                  
              methodology.  In particular, a foundational laboratory course                  
              in statistical computing provides the students with a broad                    
              introduction to numerical, graphical and symbolic computation,                 
              as well as promotes active learning via the use of calculation                 
              and plotting.
