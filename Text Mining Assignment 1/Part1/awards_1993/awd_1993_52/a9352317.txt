Abstract    :
              9352317  Frech                                                           The
              introduction of the use of a 200 MHz NMR spectrometer is  filling a major gap
              in the curriculum in the chemistry  department.  Two phases of implementation
              of the new instrument  into the program are being carried out in order to
              instruct  students at various levels of NMR expertise.  In the first  phase,
              NMR theory and techniques are being presented in a  seminar course required for
              chemistry majors and available to  all interested students and instrument
              users.  Applications of  the instrument specific to the areas of Organic and 
              Instrumental Analysis are being added to the NMR material  already presented in
              these courses.  A second phase of  integration of NMR into the undergraduate
              curriculum includes  the introduction of specialized experiments designed for 
              Inorganic, Physical, Biochemistry, and General Chemistry  laboratories.  In
              addition, the NMR spectrometer is serving as  a key component in an Integrated
              Laboratory capstone course for  Chemistry majors as well as in undergraduate
              Directed Research  projects.  Students from several nearby, smaller
              universities  also are using this instrument for instruction and research 
              applications.  ***
