Abstract    :

              Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Infrared  Spectrometry (IR) will
              be incorporated into curricula and offer  research opportunities to
              undergraduate students in Environmental  Sciences. We will establish three new
              computerized laboratory  workstations consisting of a GC/MS, a IR spectrometer
              and a 486  computer containing tutorials and environmental software. These 
              workstations will greatly enhance the undergraduate laboratory  experience for
              students learning analytical methods, chemistry, and  environmental fate of
              compounds. The GC/MS and IR are well suited  for this endeavor since together
              they can effectively analyze the  majority of OSHA and EPA regulated
              pollutants. The development plan  features hands on experience, instruction in
              principles of GC/MS  and IR spectrometry, interpretation of spectra, analytical
               techniques, and applications. Specific experiments will be  conducted to allow
              comparison of conventional GC, GC/MS and IR  techniques. Analysis for
              atmospheric gases, vapors and priority  pollutants will be covered, so they may
              be used as investigative  tools in research topics and result in scholarly
              works with  undergraduate coauthors. Since chemistry, biology and environmental
               science students will take laboratory courses using these  workstations, the
              project will impact a significant number of  students.    i
