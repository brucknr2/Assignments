Abstract    :
              9352698 Brosing In order to bridge a gap in sophistication between lower and
              intermediate level labs and the project-oriented senior-level Advanced Labs, we
              have recently introduced a Modern Physics Laboratory course.  This project is
              designed to expand this course to two semesters by introducing several new
              experiments as well as upgrading a few that were done previously.  In addition,
              equipment is being used in the Modern Physics lab that is flexible enough to
              support more advanced undergraduate research projects in the senior Advanced
              Lab course.  The experiments being developed include X-ray crystallography, the
              photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, gamma-ray spectros- copy, the Hall
              effect in germanium, measurement of the velocity of light, and holography and
              holographic gratings.  Experiments are also being added to the Modern Physics
              lab in solid state physics and modern optics, while also expanding what is
              being done in atomic and nuclear physics. ***
