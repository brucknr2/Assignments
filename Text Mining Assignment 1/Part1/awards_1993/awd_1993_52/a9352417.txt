Abstract    :
              The Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET)                      
              department of the Southern College of Technology is developing                 
              a Local Area Network (LAN) laboratory to support a new Local                   
              Area Networks course. Southern Tech realizes the impact                        
              networking has on the world today and is striving to educate                   
              and prepare undergraduates for work in this growing                            
              communications era. With the help of a grant from the National                 
              Science Foundation, the ECET LAN laboratory is giving students                 
              hands-on experience with state of the art communications                       
              equipment. The lab consists of (1) various network                             
              configurations, e.g. Ethernet and Token Ring with Novell and                   
              IBM network operating systems, (2) a variety of transmission                   
              media, e.g., coax, twisted pair, and fiber optic cabling, (3)                  
              network analysis tools that have the ability to monitor                        
              signals, examine protocols and simulate network traffic, (4) a                 
              LAN simulation package used to analyze designed networks and                   
              optimize performance, and (5) a gateway to X.25, the long haul                 
              environment, with access to DSO up to T3 lines. The students                   
              are designing, installing, and testing various LAN                             
              configurations and preparing to configure a company-wide local                 
              area network. This hands on education gained in the laboratory                 
              is preparing Southern Tech Electrical and Computer Engineering                 
              Technology graduates to contribute immediately to today's                      
              communications industry.
