Abstract    :
              Improving Quantitative and Critical Thinking Skills in                         
              Introductory Biology                                                           
              Students in an introductory biology course improve quantitative                
              and critical thinking skills by conducting laboratory exercises                
              requiring increased use of data collection, recording,                         
              analysis, and reporting.  Microscopy laboratories include                      
              exercises requiring measuring, counting and estimating.                        
              Electrophoresis experiments separating DNA fragments are                       
              incorporated into the regular laboratory schedule. Increased                   
              use of lab exercises focusing on cellular and molecular biology                
              provide students better opportunities to utilize the tools of                  
              biology and connect biology with related disciplines                           
              (chemistry). Students work in teams and utilize a collaborative                
              learning methodology which extends to both lecture and small                   
              group weekly sessions.
