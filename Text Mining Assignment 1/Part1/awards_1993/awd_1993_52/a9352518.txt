Abstract    :
              This new course combines concepts from the students' prior                     
              course work and introduces them to a broad range of modern                     
              design and testing techniques for advanced materials.                          
              Fundamental engineering concepts are followed immediately with                 
              engineering problem-solving.  A series of lab sessions have                    
              been formulated, each involving a task directed toward the                     
              reverse-engineering, evaluation, and improvement of a sample,                  
              manufactured mechanical product. Design and manufacture is                     
              approached as parallel rather than sequential tasks. The course                
              also enhances learning by increasing the level of interaction                  
              on various levels. The course is arranged in a way which                       
              emphasizes discussion and oral examination rather than lecture.                
              The instructor spends most of his/her time interacting with                    
              small groups of students rather than the entire class. The                     
              students are required to interact amongst each other in the                    
              organization and preparation of the lab reports. Unlike more                   
              traditional courses, grading will not be based strictly upon                   
              knowledge level.  Student interest in the material will be                     
              stimulated because the proposed lab sessions have both a                       
              sequence and a unifying context which give the learning                        
              experience continuity. The course will give the students                       
              exposure to more modern and advanced mechanical testing                        
              techniques, engineering materials, and approaches to the                       
              design/manufacturing interaction than they currently receive.
