Abstract    :
              9352152  Taylor                               The university will purchase an
              inductively coupled plasma  (ICP) Spectrophotometer for incorporation into the
              analytical  instrumental chemistry components of their undergraduate  programs,
              which traverse the disciplines of chemistry, aquatic  toxicology/chemistry,
              biology, microbiology and medical  technology. The incorporation of ICP into
              the curricula will  enhance their ability to educate students about the theory,
               operation and applications of modern instrumentation in  analytical chemistry.
              ICP is a relatively new technology that  is now commonly used in industry and
              government for the  analysis of metal ions; however, the principles, operation,
              and  applications of ICP are not commonly taught at undergraduate 
              universities.  The university has developed a long-standing  philosophy that
              "hands-on" training in the laboratory is the  cornerstone in the education of
              young scientists. ICP will be  incorporated into three formal classes:
              Instrumental Analysis,  Standard Methods of Water Analysis, and Aquatic
              Toxicology. In  addition, many students will gain advanced experience with the 
              ICP as part of their undergraduate research.
