Abstract    :
              9352734  Shor   An industrial-standard control laboratory with reconfigurable 
              real-time VME-bus-based architecture is being established for  undergraduate
              control engineering instruction.The motivation  for this novel proposed
              laboratory setup is to make the setting  both flexible for individual project
              design and accessible from  remote sites. The flexibility of the  architecture 
              permits  multiple projects to be developed and tested concurrently  without
              interfering with each other. The VME-bus architecture  allows the projects to
              share VME-bus devices such as data-  acquisition boards and real-time
              controllers. Further, since  the equipment is accessible from the network,
              students may  develop their software and algorithms from remote sites and  take
              advantage of available network resources. This also makes  the proposed
              laboratory accessible to persons who are disabled.  The extensive video network
               together with the network  accessibility of the laboratory, provides
              interactive  demonstration capabilities for laboratory-classroom  instruction.
              This contributes to the effort to develop  decentralized classroom
              technology.The laboratory  provides  reliable, modern, industrial-quality
              equipment to familiarize  the student with the current industrial standards.
              This quality  setup  enables the students to focus on the challenges of 
              controlling non-ideal dynamical systems and to experiment with  innovative
              ideas. A sequence of experiments is designed to  improve student understanding
              of the basic principles and  challenges of digital control.   ***
