Abstract    :
              This project is providing students with daily access to                        
              computer hardware along with mathematical software by putting                  
              computer work stations directly into two mathematics                           
              classrooms. Each classroom has twelve computers, enabling a                    
              class of thirty-six students to work on projects in groups of                  
              three. Courses taught in these computer classrooms are being                   
              centered around problem solving teams that use the computers to                
              do mathematics and to write reports that combine text with                     
              graphical and numerical output.  Students are becoming                         
              comfortable enough with the hardware and software so that they                 
              naturally and effortlessly use the computers as they think,                    
              discuss, and experiment. Daily access, rather than occasional                  
              trips to a lab, is allowing this to happen. The project is                     
              beginning in precalculus classes and then branching to                         
              intermediate algebra and calculus. With computers close at                     
              hand, faculty are fundamentally revising the way they teach                    
              mathematics.
