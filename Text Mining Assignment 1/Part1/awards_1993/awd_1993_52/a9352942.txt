Abstract    :
              9352942  Lenk    This proposal is to develop and disseminate a middle school
              (5-8)  interactive CD-ROM based science unit on The Rain Forest  Connection. 
              This unit will be a series of cooperative group  activities that use video,
              still images, animation, dramatic  stories, and actual scientific data to
              involve students in science  learning.  The content will focus on the search
              for plants in the  Indonesian rain forests containing compounds that may be
              successful  in the treatment of cancer or AIDS.  Print materials are also 
              available.  The unique nature of this project is that the CD-ROM  unit may be
              used by a teacher with 30 or more students at the same  time.
