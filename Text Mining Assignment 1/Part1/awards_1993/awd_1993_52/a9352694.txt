Abstract    :
              Shearon  9352694                                                         This
              project allows the development of laboratories in  experimental and comparative
              psychology by using basic computer  hardware and software plus video equipment.
              Specific  experiments and hands-on research include birds of prey,  various
              endangered and threatened species in our desert region,  large numbers of
              migratory species, and large tourist and  outdoors populations using wilderness
              areas in Idaho. The  project allows the department to increase the research 
              productivity of undergraduate students and faculty. More  traditional areas of
              psychology, such as, cognition, sensation,  perception and memory, are also
              opened to investigation with  the precision afforded by the computers.   ***
