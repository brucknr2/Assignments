Abstract    :
              This project will improve student instruction in electro-                      
              chemical methods through the purchase of a                                     
              potentiostat/galvanostat with a mercury drop electrode. Using                  
              this equipment, students in analytical, inorganic, and physical                
              chemistry courses will be able to explore the application of                   
              electrochemical methods to a wide range of problems. The                       
              instrument will be computer interfaced for ease of student                     
              instruction and to facilitate data collection and analysis.                    
              Experiments will range from the determination of trace amounts                 
              of inorganic and organic substances to the elucidation of                      
              reaction mechanisms. In addition, a student/faculty research                   
              project in bioinorganic chemistry will be significantly                        
              enhanced.
