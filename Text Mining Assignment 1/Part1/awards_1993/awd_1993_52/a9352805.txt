Abstract    :
              This project is developing an undergraduate laboratory using                   
              high speed microcomputers and an ethernet network. The network                 
              bridges  the institutional Academic Computing Facility Network                 
              and the NSFNET/Internet. The laboratory permits the department                 
              to significantly enhance its undergraduate curriculum at the                   
              introductory and advanced levels. Also, four major objectives                  
              are being emphasized. These include infusing content with                      
              hands-on laboratory exercises, simulations, experiments, and                   
              research experiences, mathematically-based social science                      
              courses, and the dissemination of results and products of the                  
              project. Also, special efforts are being made to disseminate                   
              our results to historically Black colleges and to other                        
              interested institutions via the institutional Faculty Resources                
              Network.
