Abstract    :
              9352760  Nations                                                         Digital
              imaging techniques are used to enhance students'  experiences in both physics
              and astronomy.  Non-science majors  (including many education majors) in a
              year-long elementary  astronomy sequence are using CCD cameras in observing and
               laboratory exercises.  This a dds a much more quantitative  component to the
              observation-oriented but largely descriptive  astronomy laboratory course. 
              Science majors in their first  (and often only) physics course, both in the
              algebra and the  calculus-based sequences, can get laboratory experience with 
              CCDs and digital image processing.  This is a technology they  are quite likely
              to encounter in their future careers.  Physics  majors in upper-division
              courses in optics, experimental  physics, and a required, research-oriented
              independent study  courses will use the equipment as well.  Research
              opportunities  in both astronomy and physics increase dramatically in both 
              spectroscopy and imaging applications.  Laboratories which  incorporate the
              CCDs are more streamlined, quantitative, and  clear than previously.   The
              systems are easily transported  between physics laboratories, which are offered
              during the day,  and astronomy laboratories, which are at night.        ***
