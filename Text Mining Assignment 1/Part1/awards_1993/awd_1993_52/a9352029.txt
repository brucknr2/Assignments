Abstract    :
              Eureka is now equipping two mathematics classrooms with                        
              computersand video display units so that they can replace the                  
              traditionallecture-chalkboard format of classroom instruction                  
              with an exploratory experimental computer-based mode of                        
              interactive classroom learning.  Students are being involved                   
              more actively in class.  Class time is being supplemented with                 
              additional student time in the computer laboratory which is                    
              available for use by all students.  Eureka is a small                          
              undergraduate college that emphasizes personal attention, small                
              class size, and a favorable student-teacher ratio.   The                       
              mathematics software they are using includes Derive, Minitab,                  
              and Exploring Small Groups.
