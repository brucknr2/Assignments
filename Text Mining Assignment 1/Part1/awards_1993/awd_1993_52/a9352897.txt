Abstract    :
              9352897  Santos                                                                 
               The Maricopa Mathematics Consortium (M2C)--composed of the  Maricopa County
              Community College District, the second largest  community college district in
              the country; Arizona State  University, the fifth largest public university in
              the United  States; and four public school districts in Maricopa County--  are
              instituting a two-year project that is resulting in  significant systemic
              change in the teaching/learning process in  precalculus mathematics: the bridge
              to calculus. The  participating institutions, who serve 235,000 students, have
              a  long history of cooperation and joint development. This  collaborative
              effort includes restructuring the curriculum,  developing materials to reflect
              the changes to be made, and  using technology and new pedagogies. Faculty/staff
              development  is being provided during all phases to build faculty support  and
              confidence in these new approaches to teaching mathematics  (776 faculty).
              During the  evaluation process, they are  examining outcomes at key benchmark
              points in the areas of  faculty development, student learning, and
              developmental  processes. A team of administrators, faculty, and staff are 
              providing leadership and management to the project with support  from key
              individuals who serve on the National Advisory  Committee.
