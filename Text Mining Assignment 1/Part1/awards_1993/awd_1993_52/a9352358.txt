Abstract    :
              9352358  Thompson  This project is designed to upgrade microcomputer laboratory 
              facilities in geography. Most of the facilities are utilized in the 
              undergraduate geography curriculum, principally at the intermediate  and
              advanced levels, and impact various courses. Undergraduate  students have
              access to personal computer workstations equipped  with various graphics and
              text peripherals. Various special-purpose  computer software packages and
              updates are also available. The  project has improved computing facilities and
              maintains and en-  hances high-quality instruction of undergraduate students in
              the  discipline.   ***
