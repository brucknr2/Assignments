Abstract    :
              9352488  DeHart  This project has established a new developmental psychology 
              laboratory, making it possible for students to gain active  experience with
              laboratory- and field-based research  techniques. This also provides
              opportunities for student  research projects. Equipment includes audio and
              video recording  instruments for use in the laboratory and in the field. 
              Computers are also used for analyzing and writing up the  results of student
              research projects. The project is expected  to enhance instruction in our
              developmental psychology courses.  In particular, it will produce audio- and
              videotaped examples  of infant and child behavior for use in class, expand
              students'  opportunities to carry out structured laboratory exercises, and 
              increase opportunities for students to carry out original  research current in
              the field.  ***
