Abstract    :
              9352234  Cunningham       Project SummaryThis project will revitalize and
              improve an  introductory digital laboratory.  Specifically the project has 
              three main purposes: (i) introducing symbolic computation to  freshmen, (ii)
              introducing field programmable gate arrays  (FPGA) to sophomores, and (iii)
              connecting entry level students  using personal computers (PC) to workstations
              using X-Windows.  It will change the course content in all of our freshman, 
              sophomore, and junior electrical engineering classes. Teaching  freshmen Maple
              (symbolic computation) and MATLAB (high level  numerical computation) will make
              them more effective in all of  their mathematics, science, and engineering
              classes. Using  FPGAs with the proper software will allow sophomore digital 
              electronics students to solve real world problems within the  time constraints
              of a weekly laboratory session. Running X-  Windows with Microsoft Windows on
              PCs will give beginning  students access to a variety of easy-to-use graphics
              based  tools on the PCs, the Electrical Engineering Department SUNs,  and the
              Tech Computer Center workstations. This will provide  workstation tools to a
              wide audience, in a friendly atmosphere,  at a low cost per user.  ***
