Abstract    :
              9352794  Chini       This project supplements a previously funded effort to
              create  a soils compenent in the Construction Management Technology  program. 
              Four new experiments are added to 7 previously  developed.  The complete set of
              experiments create a  comprehensive Soils Science and Technology course which 
              introduces students to the nature of soils and illustrates how  soil materails
              may influence certain construction operations.   The course is divided into two
              parts.  Part I is an  introduction to soil materials in conjuction with testing
               methods.  Part II addresses the earthwork in the construction  contract and
              reviwers construction items that involve soils  operations.  ***
