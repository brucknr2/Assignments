Abstract    :
              We proposed to incorporate molecular biology experiments into our              
              curriculum as a means of introducing students to modern biological             
              research techniques. The objectives of the proposed project are to             
              provide positive and realistic hands-on research experiences to our            
              majors, and increase the percentage of our graduates who pursue                
              postgraduate study or careers in science. Recombinant DNA                      
              experiments will be incorporated into the General Microbiology and             
              General Genetics courses, and a new course in Molecular Genetics               
              will be added to our curriculum. Access to the basic tools of                  
              molecular biology will provide our undergraduates with the                     
              opportunity to participate in basic research in this area and                  
              enhance their employment opportunities by helping them to develop              
              the analytical and technical skills required of modern biologists.
