Abstract    :
              This project integrates microcomputers into various aspects of                 
              our biology curriculum. The main goal is to enhance and extend                 
              the hands-on experience of a lab or field project by using                     
              microcomputers. Various tasks, including data management and                   
              analysis, simulation and model experiments, are performed in                   
              the laboratory or field. Versatile hardware is used with                       
              innovative educational software (e.g., BioQUEST) and standard                  
              software applications (e.g., StatView). In classrooms or labs,                 
              Duos with MiniDock attachments are also used in conjunction                    
              with Liquid Crystal Displays on overheads to demonstrate                       
              software applications and simulations.
