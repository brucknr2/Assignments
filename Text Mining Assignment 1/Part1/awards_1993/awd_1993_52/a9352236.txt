Abstract    :
              Monmouth College is establishing a computer configured                         
              classroom for teaching calculus. The ACM/GLCA Calculus Reform                  
              in Liberal Arts Colleges and other calculus reform projects                    
              have produced materials which make use of mathematical                         
              software. The Monmouth Calculus Classroom is providing an                      
              setting designed to use these materials in a cooperative                       
              learning environment with groups of two to three students                      
              sharing 15 networked PCs. Students are able to interact with                   
              Calculus as the classroom is used in one of three modes. In a                  
              Lecture Mode, the professor is able to show examples to                        
              reinforce concepts and demonstrate solutions to problems as                    
              students observe the output on their monitors. The Interactive                 
              Mode allows students to experiment and interact with material                  
              while the professor supervises their work by walking around the                
              classroom or from the control station. In the Reverse Control                  
              Mode, students share their discoveries with the class as the                   
              student workstation assumes the role of the control station.                   
              Additionally, the classroom is used as a mathematics laboratory                
              in an Independent Mode. This project is providing a student                    
              centered learning environment which utilizes the capabilities                  
              of mathematical software. Equipment includes IBM/compatible 486                
              student workstations and one control station, a network server,                
              Novell Netware 386, a LAN bridge, Mathematica, Microsoft                       
              Windows, and an enhanced version of LANschool.
