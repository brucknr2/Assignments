Abstract    :
              This project will develop an intermediate level instrumental                   
              analysis course and upgrade the advanced instrumental analysis                 
              course. The major instruments to be purchased and their                        
              applications include a high performance liquid chromatography                  
              (HPLC) system and a capillary electrophoresis (CE) system. This                
              project is significant because "hands on" experience with                      
              modern instrumentation that was formerly available only to                     
              senior level chemistry majors will now be accessible to many                   
              more students. In addition, student understanding of the                       
              principles and student proficiency in the practice of liquid                   
              chromatography and capillary electrophoresis will be enhanced.
