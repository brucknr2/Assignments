Abstract    :
              9352969  Bishop    The California State University, Los Angeles seeks to
              intimate a  four and one-half week, commuter, Young Scholars project in the 
              summer with follow-up activities during the academic year.  The  project is in
              Mathematics for fifty highly motivated, predominantly  Black and Latino
              students in grades 10, 11 and 12.  The summer  component combines course work
              in group theory and number theory  with laboratory, research, field trips
              activities.  The academic  year Saturdays sessions on campus involve follow-up
              of summer  activities, student presentations, and science fairs participation.
