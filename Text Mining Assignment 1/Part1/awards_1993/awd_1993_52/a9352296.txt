Abstract    :
              9352296  Altschuler  An inverted microscope with microinjection capabilities 
              enhances the quality of independent student research projects.  Seniors and
              lower division students can now carry out tissue  culture work, observe living
              specimens and record their  observations for presentation at scientific
              meetings.  ***
