Abstract    :
              Acquisition of a multinuclear (1H, 13C, 19F, 31P) Fourier                      
              Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer will                
              have a significant impact on the undergraduate chemistry                       
              curricula. Educational opportunities in eight existing courses                 
              will be significantly enhanced, including Instrumental                         
              Analysis, Advanced Instrumental Analysis, Organic Chemistry,                   
              Advanced Organic Chemistry, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry,                      
              Biochemistry, Physical Chemistry, and Elements of Research.                    
              This instrument will provide the students with analytical                      
              capabilities to determine both 1D and 2D-NMR spectral data for                 
              proton, carbon, fluorine, and phosphorous. The FT-NMR will                     
              significantly enhance laboratory studies for students in                       
              conventional and research courses, with improved data for                      
              structural elucidations, kinetic studies, and characterizations                
              of complexes. The FT-NMR will also be used for workshops that                  
              include instructors and students from both high schools and                    
              two-year colleges.
