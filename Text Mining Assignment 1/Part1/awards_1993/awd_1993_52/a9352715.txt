Abstract    :
              9352715  Senftleber       The university will purchase a flame and graphite
              furnace  atomic absorption spectrometry for metal ion analysis.  The 
              experience will extend to general chemistry, analytical  chemistry,
              instrumental analysis, physical chemistry, and  environmental science. 
              Environmental projects will focus on  local sites. Undergraduate research as
              well as teacher  inservice classes will also benefit from this new direction 
              emphasis.             ***
