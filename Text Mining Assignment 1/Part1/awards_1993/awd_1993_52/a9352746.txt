Abstract    :
              9352746  Ganezer  We have drawn upon our research and teaching experience in 
              Particle and Nuclear physics to formulate an upper division  laboratory.  It is
              designed to prepare students for careers in  academic and industrial research
              in subatomic physics.   Specific emphasis is placed upon providing students
              with a  thorough practical and up-to-date background in Particle and  Nuclear
              physics.  The program is designed for a small  department with limited
              infrastructure.  It will complement and  enhance a student assisted research
              program.  ***
