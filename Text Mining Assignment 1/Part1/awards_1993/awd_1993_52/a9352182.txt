Abstract    :
              9352182  Cleveland  It is increasingly clear that interdisciplinary approaches
              are  required in the natural and social sciences to characterize and  solve
              global environmental problems. Accordingly, this project is  helping implement
              a new undergraduate interdisciplinary program in  environmental studies. The
              project is aimed specifically at  improving the instruction of quantitative
              systems modeling,  geographic information systems (GIS) techniques, and
              computer  networking to undergraduates in the social sciences. An  
              environmental modeling course teaches students a systems-oriented  approach to
              the analysis of environmental problems. GIS courses  provide students with the
              skills and technologies for spatial  analysis. Environmental networking teaches
              students how to use  electronic communication networks. All courses also
              encourage  independent student research projects and collaboration with 
              faculty.  ***
