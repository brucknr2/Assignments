Abstract    :
              9352173  Bern  This project builds on faculty expertise on biomaterials (such 
              as grain, oilseeds, forage, animal waste, dust, soil, water,  odor-laden air,
              or animals) developed through research to  develop new lab activities.  In
              particular, instructors plan to  offer innovative exercises in new areas like
              computer-vision  quality analysis of grain, three-dimensional stress analysis
              of  soil core samples, grain deterioration measurement, and animal  response to
              environment.   This project involves procuring  specialized lab equipment for
              use in student labs and  undergraduate research projects. The 18 pieces of
              equipment  requested will be used in 16 courses, for lab activities  involving
              1,500 students taking departmental courses and  completing research projects
              over the next 5 years.  In  addition, 14 research ideas for the Research
              Experiences for  Undergraduates program will use equipment requested, and 
              minority high school students will participate in weekend  workshops in the
              biomaterials lab.  ***
