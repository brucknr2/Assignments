Abstract    :
              9352598  Haywick  The Department of Geology and Geography offers a variety of 
              undergraduate courses in the geosciences including components  of mineralogy,
              petrology, and sedimentology. Petrographic  techniques learned in these courses
              are vital to students  interested in pursuing graduate research in geology as
              well as  to geologists employed in the petroleum, hydrology and mineral 
              exploration industries. The Department is using a  cathodoluminoscope in the
              undergraduate teaching curriculum and  encouraging undergraduate students to
              use it in directed  research projects in the fields of sedimentology,
              mineralogy,  petrology and low temperature geochemistry. The addition of a 
              cathodoluminoscope to the department significantly improves  undergraduate
              teaching in a wide variety of geology courses.  Students benefit by gaining
              more comprehensive knowledge of  lecture material and through the technical
              skills they develop  during cathodoluminescence analysis and thin-section 
              microscopy. This greatly enriches their understanding of  geological processes
              and gives them the knowledge they need  when competing for entry to graduate
              schools or the work force.  ***
