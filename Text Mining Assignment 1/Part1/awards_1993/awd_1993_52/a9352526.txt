Abstract    :
              This project will greatly enhance our ability to teach about                   
              the importance of accurate chemistry reports and their use in                  
              manufacturing and quality engineering.  Accurate chemistry                     
              reports are needed for on-site alloy preparation, on-site heat                 
              treatment activities, stress/strain diagram interpretation,                    
              metallographic sample analysis, material removal and horsepower                
              calculations, and quality assurance report preparation. These                  
              subjects are covered more than once in at least four of our                    
              courses. The courses identified are required for all                           
              Engineering and Industrial Technology majors in the department.                
              Specifically, the project will use a 24 element capable Glow                   
              Discharge Emissions Spectrometer and a Carbon/Sulfur                           
              Determinator system to accurately determine all alloying                       
              elements in the aluminum, copper base, and ferrous based                       
              alloys. This will allow students to instantly analyze and                      
              mathematically adjust furnace heats in the foundry, select                     
              appropriate phase diagrams and time/temperature/ transformation                
              diagrams for various heat treatment activities and obtain hard                 
              copy print-outs of chemistry reports that would typically be                   
              used for quality assurance reports.
