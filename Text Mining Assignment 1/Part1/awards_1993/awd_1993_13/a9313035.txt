Abstract    :
              9313035  Najar       Eigenvalues of graphs first arose in the study of  graphs
              from an algebraic viewpoint.  In the past ten years,  there have been a number
              of fundamental developments in  spectral graph theory brought about by the
              strong interplay  between graph theory and a variety of areas, including group 
              representations, number theory, differential geometry,  communication networks,
              algorithms and computational  complexity as well as chemistry and physics. 
              Such cross-  fertilization has produced powerful new techniques and  deeper
              understanding of the fundamental structure of graphs.  Also, results in
              spectral graph theory have led to numerous  applications in these diverse
              areas.       There is a strong cadre of active researchers in  combinatorics at
              several California universities.  The  conference will be an opportunity for
              interested researchers  to hear an informative set of lectures on the state of 
              research in a very active area.  It will encourage  newcomers, graduate and
              postdoctoral students, to do  research in the area of graph theory and
              combinatorics.
