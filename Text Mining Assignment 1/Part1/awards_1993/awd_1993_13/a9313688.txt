Abstract    :
              9313688  Furbish  This project is aimed at providing a general description of
              the  complex flow fields that can occur in steep mountain streams, whose 
              morphologies consist of irregular arrangements of stable boulders  and logs,
              and small gravel bars.  The treatment makes use of both  linear and nonlinear
              formulations involving depth-integrated  equations of momentum and mass
              continuity to describe how  streamwise and transverse flow velocities, and
              water-surface  topography, respond to an irregular bed whose topography is 
              significantly more complex than that of alluvial self-formed  channels.  The
              work is an extension of a linear model which  predicts that the wavelength of
              nascent bend forms can be longer  than that of the dominant bendforms. 
              Theoretical aspects of the  work will be tested with data collected rom North
              Boulder Creek,  Colorado.  Data will come from a single reach of nearly 80
              channel  widths in length, and from two short reaches selected for detailed 
              measurements of bed topography and flow.  Results will provide a  mechanical
              basis for testing the idea that these bouldery channels  can undergo a
              self-stabilizing period that involves an interaction  among extant flow
              conditions, variable erodibility of bed and bank  materials, local armoring of
              the bed, and piecemeal transport of  sediment.
