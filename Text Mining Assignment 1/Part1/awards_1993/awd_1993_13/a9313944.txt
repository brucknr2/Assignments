Abstract    :
              9313944  Hossenlopp  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program of the 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. J.M. Hossenlopp of Marquette  University will
              investigate the energy disposal patterns in the  products of molecular
              elimination reactions which occur via an  asynchronous mechanism.  Experiments
              will be performed on a  series of moderate-to-large size organic carbonyl
              compounds  which undergo photochemical eliminations initiated via an 
              intramolecular hydrogen abstraction by the carbonyl oxygen.  Polyatomic
              eliminiation products will be probed by high  resolution spectroscopy to
              provide a detailed view of the  dynamics of the carbonyl photodissociation
              process. The primary  goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive
              framework  for interpretation of the photodissociation dynamics of the  class
              of carbonyl photochemical reactions known as the Norrish  Type II split.  %%% 
              Unimolecular and bimolecular reaction dynamics stand at the  forefront of
              contemporary resarch in physical chemistry.  Among  the problems considered are
              how do reactions proceed along  different possible and competing pathways. 
              This research  project deals with the exploration of the reaction dynamics of 
              polyatomic molecules and their dissociation products produced  by photochemical
              processes.  ***
