Abstract    :
              This project is attempting to speed up computer arithemtic by  several orders of
              magnitude using a combination of algorithmic,  circuit, and packaging
              techniques.  CAD tools to automate the  application of these techniques are
              also being developed under the  project.  Specific research problems include
              the development of a  package capable of passing large numbers of signals with
              100  picosecond rise times, and the integration of wave pipelined data  paths
              into an overall system.
