Abstract    :
              9313654    Candela    The goal of this proposal is to obtain long time series of
              data, which can be used to examine the annual and inter-annual signal in the
              flow through the straits of Sicily and Gibraltar, and to develop a method for
              long-term monitoring of the Atlantic- Mediterranean exchange.  The proposed
              work consists  of a two-year (1/94-1/96) moored array of current-meters, and
              pressure, temperature and conductivity sensors at the Strait of Gibraltar.  It
              will be undertaken in cooperation with the European Community-sponsored PRIMO-1
              program. Four six-month deployments are anticipated, all using a Spanish naval
              vessel. In addition a total of six sea level (PTC) sensors will be installed
              bracketing the Gibraltar moorings and the European's ones in the strait of
              Sicily.    ***     P Q R S T U V W X Y Z   \   ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j   l m
