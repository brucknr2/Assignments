Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is designed to take advantage of a suite of low                  
              probability and ephemeral physical environmental conditions that               
              should allow the significant extension of data sets having to do               
              with the effects of an urbanizing landscape on a lake ecosystem.               
              Historical data sets are available for comparison of lake behavior             
              attributable to this cold season's peculiar set of conditions. It              
              is expected that significant changes will be observed in the                   
              patterns of streamborne nutrient inputs to the lake.  Even more                
              interesting, however, is the possibility of using the data for the             
              evaluation of "bottom up" versus "top down" assertions that                    
              currently abound in the aquatic ecology community.                             
                                                                                             
              Studies of the type represented by this project provide the                    
              foundation for better understanding and, therefore, the better                 
              management of aquatic resources.  It can be expected that the work             
              will be important not only within the sphere of fundamental                    
              aquatic science but also to water resource managers involved in                
              decisions regarding water quality and fisheries.
