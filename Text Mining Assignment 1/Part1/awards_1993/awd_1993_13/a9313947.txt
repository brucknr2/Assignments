Abstract    :
              9313947  Fernandez  According to the report of the Office of Science and
              Technology Program, Executive Office of the President on National Critical
              Technologies, "Intelligent processing equipment is the foundation of the shop
              project is to investigate schemes to use applied intelligence in automated
              manufacturing processing operations like Computer Numerical Control machine
              tools.  The term "applied intelligence" refers to the technologies: expert
              (knowledge-based) systems, fuzzy logic systems, and artificial neural system
              (ANS).  These supporting technologies combined with robust control and
              automated modeling techniques offer a tremendous potential when confronted with
              unstructured environments like manufacturing processes.  Real-world
              (unstructured) operating conditions, such as those found in manufacturing
              processes, are characterized by noisy sensor and actuators, as well as  process
              noise, drifts, system faults, and external disturbances.  This project will
              construct a "nervous system" for a machining center that will observe various
              states of the machining system, :learn" the dynamics of a machining process,
              construct corrective codes, and initiate control.  The approach will
              incorporate the "experience" into a knowledge base leaving an insightful trace
              about the signal processing capabilities of artificial neural networks,
              knowledge representation tools like fuzzy systems, and robust nonlinear control
              techniques like sliding mode control, is designed to be "intelligent".  ***   v
