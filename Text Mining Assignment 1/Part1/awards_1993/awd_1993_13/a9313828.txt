Abstract    :
              9313828  Johnson  This Americas Program award will support a research 
              collaboration between Prof. Markes E, Johnson of the  Department of Geology of
              Williams College and Prof.  Jorge Ledesma Vazquez of the Universidad Autonoma
              de  Baja California (UABC) in Baja California, Mexico.   The purpose of the
              collaboration is to study various  relationships among geological formations
              located in  a series of small sedimentary basins at the base of  the Concepcion
               Peninsula in Baja California.    A previous reconnaissance survey revealed the
               unexpected presence of widespread bedded cherts in  these basins and
              preliminary thin sections expose  microfossils of dinoflagelates.  The
              researchers  intend to test the theory that some of the geological  formations
              represent periods of local tectonic uplift,  while others, including limestones
              and cherts,  represent episodes of marine incursion related to  rising sea
              level.  The collaboration will involve  undergraduate students from Williams
              College and from  UABC, thus providing them with an early research  experience.
