Abstract    :
                      9313038  Enright    The main thrust of this research is to explore the 
              properties of a type of working short-term memory  involved  in sensorimotor
              processing.  Motor responses such as  redirecting the eyes or pointing with a
              finger can be made  not only toward objects actually seen, but also toward 
              rememberd object locations.  Dr. Enright's experiments will  uncover details of
              how these two kinds of movements are  performed.  These studies will help
              deteremine the validity  of our current understanding, derived from 
              neurophysiological studies, of how the visual world is  mapped within the brain
              and how information in visual maps  is held for a time to be used in guiding
              behavior.  This  work will have direct bearing on our knowledge of human 
              sensory perception and motor planning -- both of which are  essential for
              attempts to optimize human interaction with  the environment.  ***
