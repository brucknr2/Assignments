Abstract    :
              Gardner          Controlled environmental growth chambers are key to many of the
               research projects on the campus of the University of Minnesota that study 
              plants, algae and fungi.  This award supports the modernization of these growth
               chambers so that research in plant biology, and horticulture science can be 
              pursued in  up-to-date  facilities.  These renovated facilities will allow this
               university to continue the high level of research on genetically engineered 
              organisms and remain competitive and compliant in the biotechnology arena.  
              This award will replace 54 growth chambers used by  faculty and students in 
              five departments.  Seventeen postdocs, 35 graduate students and 10 
              undergraduate students will be impacted because of the newly planned 
              facilities.  This project will increase the capabilities in biotechnology
              research at  the University of Minnesota.
