Abstract    :
              9313237  Ousterhout  In this research project, innovative analytical techniques
              are  developed for modeling and controlling sheet forming processes by 
              combining closed-loop control theory with real-time process  measurements. The
              procedure leads to optimum binder force profile  in both space and time, and
              increases the level of in-process  control and disturbance rejection towards
              significantly improving  accuracy, part-to part consistency and flexibility.
              The project  includes the design, fabrication and testing of a deep-drawing 
              apparatus with a multivariable force controlled binder to test  the analytical
              methods, and to assess the performance of the  multivariable force controlled
              binder over a wide variety of  materials and part configurations. The variable
              force controlled  binder has the force control characteristics to regulate the 
              binding force, and the capability to generate a variable force  profile along
              the perimeter of the binder that changes with  position and time. The results
              of this research lead to the  development of theory and establishment of
              technology for  improving accuracy and flexibility in sheet forming process.
