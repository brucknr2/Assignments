Abstract    :
              Horizontal gene transfer has been proposed to account for                      
              patterns of expression of mobile genetic elements among non-                   
              interbreeding species.  Until recently no multi-celled organism                
              could be targeted as a potential agent of such transfer.  There                
              is now, however, biochemical evidence that implicates the mite                 
              Proctolaelaps regalis DeLeon as such a transfer agent for one                  
              class of mobile elements (P elements) among species of                         
              Drosophila.  Little is known about the evolution of P elements,                
              and empirical evidence is completely lacking concerning the                    
              frequency of horizontal transfer of any mobile element. The                    
              Drosophila-Proctolaelaps interaction is the first system in which              
              such questions can be experimentally addressed.                                
              %%%                                                                            
              The overall objective of this proposal is to experimentally verify             
              that this interspecific transfer can indeed occur in an observable             
              manner under laboratory conditions, using the polymerase chain                 
              reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis.  If successful, this initially             
              high-risk endeavor will open the door to a research program                    
              involving controlled laboratory manipulation of a previously                   
              intractable area of valuable research which has far-reaching                   
              implications for understanding novel mechanisms of inheritance, the            
              phylogeny of Drosophila, the innovation of new species, and the                
              evolution of host-parasite and predator-prey interactions.
