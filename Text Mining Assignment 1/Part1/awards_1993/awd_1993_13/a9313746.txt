Abstract    :
              9313746  Finn  The focus of this research is the development of the chemistry 
              of bimetallic Fischer carbene complexes containing an added,  electron
              deficient, metal center attached to the carbene  heteroatom.  The second metal
              center serves to heighten the  reactivity of the complexes and acts as a
              template for the  organization of the carbene and substrate moieties leading to
               selective transformations.  The potential of the reagents for  catalytic
              carbene transfer will also be explored.  %%%  With this renewal award, the
              Synthetic Organic Program is  supporting the research of Dr. M.G. Finn of the
              Department of  Chemistry at the University of Virginia.  Professor Finn will 
              focus his work on the chemistry of Fischer complexes, carbene  complexes that
              that engage in a wide variety of reactions  with carbon-carbon double and
              triple bonds.  ***
