Abstract    :
              9313934  Andreou  This project will attempt to  develop a new class of recurrent
               networks.  The architecture of the  networks is inspired by recent work  on
              image encoding based on iterated  transformation theory and it's  associated
              inverse problems.  The  PIs purpose to restrict our  investigation to networks
              that can  be physically implemented in  subthreshold analog VLSI.  With  their
              approach analog components  that implement high quality  arithmetic operations
              are  unnecessary.  Indeed, significant  departures from ideal linear  behavior
              can be tolerated, provided  that these departures are  reproducible across
              chips.  As a  concrete application they will  consider that task of data 
              compression and decompression.   Compression is accomplished by the  relaxation
              of an electronic circuit  to a steady state while compression  is preformed
              either off-line or  with an adaptive analog VLSI neural  network architecture. 
              For hardware  compression they propose to use a  learning algorithm that learns
              both  the weight and the connection  topology.  Hence, the ability to  gate and
              switch electrical current  is central to the operation of  these networks.  The
              main thrust of  this investigation is to design and  characterize the circuits
              that  implement the required  transformations in one dimension.   A successful
              outcome to this  investigation has the potential for  making compression and 
              decompression technology available  for all low-power applications.  ***
