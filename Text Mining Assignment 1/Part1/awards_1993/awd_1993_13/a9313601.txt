Abstract    :
              9313601  Policansky    This award will enable the National Academy of Science
              (NAS) to  continue management of U.S. scientific participation in the 
              international Scientific Committee on Problems in the Environment  (SCOPE), a
              committee of the International Council of Scientific  Unions (ICSU).  The
              objectives of SCOPE, which was created in  1969) are: (1) to advance knowledge
              of (a) the influence of  humans on their environment and (b) the effects of
              environmental  changes upon people, their health, and their welfare, 
              particularly those influences and effects that are either global  or are shared
              by several nations; and (2) to serve as a council  of scientists acting as a
              source of advice to governments and  intergovernmental bodies on issues
              concerning the environment.   This award would enable members of the U.S.
              National Committee  for SCOPE, whose activities are managed by the NAS, to
              continue  their involvement in international projects coordinated by SCOPE  on
              sustainable development, biodiversity, and the effects of  increased
              ultraviolet radiation on biological systems.
