Abstract    :
              9313186 Gross          The project develops a computer aided design method for
              laying out subsystems in building designs.  By using a CAD program with
              embedded assembly rules and spatial layout rules, each subsystem designer can
              subscribe to this layout method.  The project develops and tests and
              interactive layout program based on constraint techniques that can be
              programmed to manage and enforce different sets of layout rules.  A series of
              design experiments test and evaluate the layout method and the program that
              supports it.  A team of designers use the program to design a series of
              increasingly complex layouts using residential wood frame buildings as an
              example.  evaluation includes interviews with the participants and reviews by
              external consultants with experience in subsystem layout.          The
              objective of the method is to support cooperative design by minimizing spatial
              interference conflicts among the designers of different subsystems  the pipes,
              ducts and wires that supply water, electricity, and ventilation.  The method
              restricts the placement of subsystems into preallocated spatial zones,
              restricting interference conflicts to predictable locations that can be
              resolved with predetermined fixes.  It supports cooperative design by allowing
              members of a design team to work independently and in parallel knowing that
              their respective designs can easily be integrated.
