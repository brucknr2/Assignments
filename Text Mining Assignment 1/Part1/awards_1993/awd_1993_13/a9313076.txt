Abstract    :
                      9313076  Chen  Concrete materials exhibit both extremes of behavior:
              that is,  ductile flow and brittle fracture.  Under certain conditions, a 
              transition between brittle and ductile behavior occurs, yet no  distinction
              between the two modes has been made in any of the  present failure criteria and
              related theories.  Ideally  constitutive equations should reflect both the
              modes of deformation  and the possibility of a brittle-ductile transition. 
              Also, because  concrete materials are highly non-homogeneous, especially in the
               softening regime where cracking is widespread, macroscopic  observations are
              not sufficient.  Therefore, a unified elastic-  plastic-damage theory is
              proposed, which is based on recent  fundamental understanding of concrete
              micro-mechanics.  New  software development systems are thus necessary for
              adequate  development and testing of new material models.  A software 
              development environment for structural engineering focused on  software
              reusability.
