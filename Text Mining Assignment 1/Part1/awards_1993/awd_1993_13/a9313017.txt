Abstract    :
              9313017  Sultan    Technical Narrative:    This project represents a
              collaborative research  effort between Washington University and the  Egyptian
              Geological Survey in Cairo, Egypt.  The  investigators intend to use field
              mapping, remote  sensing, and high precision U-Pb dating  techniques in order
              to advance our knowledge of  the geologic history of southern Egypt.  This 
              study will have implications for the  understanding of the continental
              evolution of  Africa.  Project funding will allow the  researchers to conduct
              geochronologic and  isotopic investigations in southern Egypt as well  as
              enable an Egyptian geologist to visit the  state-of-the-art laboratory
              facilities at  Washington University in order to receive  advanced training in
              remote sensing  interpretation and modern isotopic dating  techniques.    This
              project in petrology and geochemistry  fulfills the program objective of
              advancing  scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts  in the United
              States and Egypt to combine  complementary talents and conduct research in 
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  ***
