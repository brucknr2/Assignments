Abstract    :
              9313739  Shaw    The purpose of US-Japan Workshop on High Tc Superconductivity
              are  to bring together specialists from both countries to exchange  information
              on recent advances, and to identify the problem areas  that are particularly
              suited for international cooperative  programs.  The 6th US-Japan Workshop will
              be held in Houston,  Texas, hosted by the Texas Center on Superconductivity at
              the  University of Houston on December 7-8, 1993.  The Workshop is  organized
              to address research problems in four technical areas,  they are:  wire and coil
              development; phase equilibrium and  processing issues for bulk materials; thin
              films and new materials;  and vortex dynamics and pinning.  Participants are
              invited to the  Workshop, and they are selected from university, industry, and 
              national laboratories.  %%%  This project is for the 6th US-Japan Workshop to
