Abstract    :
              9313394   Rouch       The research is for the development of techniques for 
              controlling chatter and vibration in machining by use of a actively  controlled
              dynamic absorber.  The inertial force generated by  actuation of the secondary
              mass relative to the cutting tool  assembly modifies the system dynamic
              characteristics.  The proof of  concept design using a piezoelectric actuator
              packaged inside of  the boring bar has been demonstrated to be effective.  The
              research  is to provide an enhanced theoretical basis for the approach and 
              extend its range of application to a wider variety of practical  machining
              conditions.  In particular, robust controller  methodologies will be
              investigated and the system design parameters  optimized.  Higher force and
              higher stroke capabilities will be  sought in the application to boring
              operations.  Extension to multi  point machining such as milling are also to be
              considered.  Successful completion of the research should enable a stable 
              operation of boring bars with higher length to diameter ratios.  Material
              removal rates and accuracies in boring and milling  operations will be
              improved.
