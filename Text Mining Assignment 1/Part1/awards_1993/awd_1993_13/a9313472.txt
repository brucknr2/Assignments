Abstract    :
              9313472  Barnett  The Biology Department at San Diego State University is the 
              second largest academic department in the University.  Research  expertise in
              diverse areas of biology is organized into three  major program areas within
              the department: (1) cell and molecular  biology (2) ecology, and (3)
              systematics and evolution.  The  department plays a key role in providing
              research training  required for a scientifically literate workforce in the
              areas of  biotechnology, environmental protection and environmental impact. 
              The microbiology program is critical for those students enrolled  in masters
              and doctoral programs in microbiology and cell and  molecular biology,  as well
              as those students who pursue  employment in the local biotechnology industry. 
              In addition, the  department has a major role in training teachers for K-12 
              education and training personnel for health-related occupations.    ARI funds
              are requested to renovate laboratory space in the Life  Sciences North building
              to provide a new faculty research space  and to upgrade an existing facility
              that provides support for  faculty members doing research in virology,
              immunology,  bacteriology and microbial genetics.  The existing space, 
              constructed in 1962, is poorly designed for current research, and  does not
              comply with health and safety regulations.  The  renovation of this space will
              increase research training  opportunities in microbiology, for a diverse
              population of  undergraduate and graduate students by providing a modern 
              research laboratory to conduct experiments, and increase the  efficiency and
              utility of research support for current faculty.  ***
