However, intuitively, those explanation was very hard for a fair number of scientists to swallow because it is hard to imagine how He and Ne, rare gases, would remain so isolate in an ever differentiating and evolving earth when all other isotopic systems and elements have been disturbed.  Don Anderson (CIT) has now challenged this concept         2       in the latest issue of    Science    and argued that the high    3   He in the mantle source of the hot spot basalts may be seeing a subducted sedimentary component that contains extraterrestrial rare gases incorporated in tiny dust particles.  In order to test this iconoclastic idea, the PI has formulated a simple but elegant test, namely to analyze old  0 80 million years) sedimentary cares from the oceans for these isotopes.  His objective is to evaluate whether the results are negative or positive, will have great impact on our understanding of geochemical reservoirs in the earth's mantle, cosmic fluxes of materials to the oceanic sediments, and the importance of subducted sedimentary component in oceanic island volcanism. ***
