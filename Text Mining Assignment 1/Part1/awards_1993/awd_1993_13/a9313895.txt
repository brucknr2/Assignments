Abstract    :
              9313895  Wyche    Many reasons account for the underrepresentation of minorities
              in  important fields of biological sciences.  A major contributing  factor has
              been the paucity of opportunities for significant  numbers of competent
              minorities to receive high caliber educational  training at the best academic
              institutions, and insufficient  exposure to high caliber scientists and
              research laboratories.  In  an effort to correct some of these deficiencies,
              the Minorities  Affairs Committee (MAC) of the American Society for Cell
              Biology  (ASCB) has set forth the following objectives:  1, to provide  travel
              grants to underrepresented minorities from minority and  majority institutions
              to attend the annual meeting of the ASCB,  which provides recipients with the
              opportunity to attend symposia,  workshops, poster sessions, and to interact
              with peers and leading  ASCB scientists; 2, to provide tuition, laboratory
              fees, housing  and travel support to minority students and scientists to attend
               academic and/or technical courses and workshops at high quality  academic
              sites such as the Marine Biological Laboratory and Friday  Harbor Laboratory
              summer courses; 3, to support summer trainees and  visiting professors in
              research laboratories offering state-of-the-  art programs in cell and
              molecular biology; 4, to support  orientation meetings of the ASCB minorities
              attending the annual  meeting, mini-scientific symposia and workshops, and an
              annual ASCB  breakfast meeting during the annual meeting; 5, to provide funds
              to  support essential secretarial and managerial services provided by  the ASCB
              executive office and printing costs to inform the  scientific community of
              opportunitites for underrepresented  minorities.  ***    9313895  Wyche    Many
