Abstract    :
              9313062  Buyukozturk      This  project  will  investigate  the  role  of 
              mortar-aggregate  interfaces  on the mechanical behavior of high strength 
              concrete  composites.  the general objective of the project is to establish 
              the  fundamental criteria governing the strength,  stiffness  and  ductility 
              of  high  strength concrete  through  studies  of  the  material as a composite
              consisting of a high strength mortar  and  aggregate  system.  the emphasis
              will be on the role of interface  toughness on the composite material behavior.
               Fracture mechanics  based  laboratory  experiments  and  numerical  studies 
              will  be  performed on concrete models with high strength mortar matrix and 
              aggregate   inclusions   having   different   material   property  combinations
               with controlled interface fracture characteristics.  The  required  interface 
              fracture  toughness  data  for  various  mortar/aggregate systems will be
              assessed based on  the  approach  developed  through previous research.  The
              variation of interface  strength, achieved using controlled amounts of silica
              fume,  will  be implemented in the parametric studies for the properties.  The 
              research  is expected to provide a fundamental knowledge  of  the  effects  of
              mortar-aggregate interfaces on high strength concrete  behavior and to have a
              direct impact on its production and use in  an efficient, economical, and sate
              manner.  ***
