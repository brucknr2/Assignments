Abstract    :
              9313677  Durbin             The dominant copepod species on Georges Bank,
              Calanus  finmarchicus, Pseudocalanus moultoni and P. newmani, show strong 
              interannual variation in abundance that may significantly alter  energy flow
              and larval fish recruitment in different years.  We  hypothesize that:  (1)
              Recruitment variability in the dominant  copepods reflects interannual
              differences in the abundance and  source of the parental stock, and to the
              effect of food upon the  egg laying rates of adult females; (2) Subtle changes
              in regional  climate strongly influence processes controlling the abundance and
               production of the parental stock of Calanus in the Gulf of Maine  (GOM); and
              (3) Production rates of Calanus will be food limited on  Georges Bank except
              during the peak of the spring bloom, whereas  winter/spring period.  These two
              species will therefore respond  differently to seasonal changes in food levels
              on Georges Bank.         We propose to investigate two major aspects of Calanus
               finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp population dynamics and  production on
              Georges Bank, in relation to the above hypotheses:   (1) The recruitment of
              Calanus and Pseudocalanus on Georges Bank  during the winter/spring period, as
              inferred from pump samples to  quantitatively sample nauplii and early
              copepodites during the  broad scale surveys;  and (2) The rates of growth and
              egg  production of Calanus and Pseudocalanus on Georges Bank, in  relation to
              small scale spatial and temporal variability in the  food environment during
              the process cruises.
