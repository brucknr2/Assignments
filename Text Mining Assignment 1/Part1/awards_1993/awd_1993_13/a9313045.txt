Abstract    :
              9313045  Berger       The Fifth International Valencia Meeting on Bayesian 
              Statistics will be held from June 5 - 10, 1994, in Alicante,  Spain.  This
              series of international meetings is the major  venue for presentation and
              dissemination or research on  Bayesian statistical methodology.  The Bayesian
              approach to  statistics has experienced astonishing growth in recent  years,
              driven in large part by its ability to solve  difficult applied statistical
              problems in science and  society in general.  Participation in this meeting is 
              crucial for researchers, especially young researchers, as  the pace of
              developments in the area substantially outstrips  the pace of publications.  By
              attending the meeting,  researchers will be able to acquire the latest Bayesian
               techniques, and will have ample opportunity to obtain  feedback on their own
              work.  A portion of the grant will go  towards expenses of graduate students,
              since attendance at  the conference will greatly augment their statistical 
              education.
