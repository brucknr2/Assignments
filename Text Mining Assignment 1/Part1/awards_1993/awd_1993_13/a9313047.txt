Abstract    :
              9313047  DiNardo    Technical abstract:  It is proposed to combine temperature- 
              dependent momentum-resolved electron vibrational spectroscopy with  theoretical
              calculations and simulations to study the dynamics of  reconstructed
              semiconductor surfaces and epitaxial interfaces.  A  new, high-resolution
              angle-resolved electron energy loss  spectrometer (HREELS) will be applied to
              the measurement of the  surface phonon band structures of the Si(001) and
              Ge(001) surfaces  and the heteroepitaxial Ge/Si(001) interface.  The surface 
              potentials of these systems are strongly anharmonic, resulting in  dramatic
              temperature-dependent structural and vibrational changes  that will be probed
              for the first time experimentally with electron  loss spectroscopy and modeled
              theoretically.    Non-technical abstract:  The detailed characterization of 
              semiconductor surfaces and interfaces is of a considerable  fundamental and
              technological interest.  It is proposed to study  the surfaces of
              semiconductors by investigating their surface  vibrational properties.  The
              principal experiment tool will be a  state-of-the-art high resolution electron
              energy loss spectrometer.   It is planned to investigate the vibrational
              properties of surfaces  and interfaces as a function of temperature in order to
              provide  information about the dynamics of the surfaces.  These studies are 
              likely to have an impact on semiconductor processing, including  growth and
              etching phenomena.  ***
