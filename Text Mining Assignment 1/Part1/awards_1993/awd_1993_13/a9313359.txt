Abstract    :
              Chin    The Wilmore Laboratory, constructed in 1947, houses the research
              programs of  Chemical, Civil, Materials, and Mechanical Engineering on the
              campus of Auburn  University.  The majority of laboratory space is utilized for
              research and research  training in Chemical and Materials Engineering.  In
              addition, the building houses two  university  service facilities, electron
              microscopy and chemical analysis laboratories,  which support activities of
              faculty members engaged in  engineering and physical  science research. 
              Approximately  300 scientific personnel use the facility to conduct  research
              activities.  However  due to the age and the deteriorating condition of the 
              Laboratory, the quality of research and research training performed in the
              facility has  been severely restricted.    This award will provide funding for
              the renovation of engineering research space.   Specifically the renovations
              will include: improving the electrical, HVAC and plumbing  systems, modernizing
              fire safety systems, providing handicapped accessibility in the  building and
              replacing the roof.  Installation of clean rooms, new chemical fume hoods  and
              fume extraction systems will allow faculty to participate in new avenues of 
              research such as the development and fabrication of intrinsically adaptive
              materials.   Certain activities that were curtailed due to safety
              considerations will resume once  renovations are completed.  Because the
              College of Engineering is the largest in the  state of Alabama and minority
              groups are strongly represented in the state, this  infrastructure project will
              significantly improve Auburn's efforts in recruiting minorities in 
              engineering.
