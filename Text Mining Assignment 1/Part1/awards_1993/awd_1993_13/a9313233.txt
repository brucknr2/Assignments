Abstract    :
                9313233  Moran  This research will develop nonlinear (both material and
              geometric)  and nonlocal finite element methods for the quantitative analysis 
              of solid-state phase transformations.  A unified approach based on 
              minimization, via finite elements, of the Landau-Ginzburg free  energy will be
              developed for application to three-dimensional  nucleation.   The methods
              developed will provide quantitative  predictions of interfacial energies and
              lead to a deeper  understanding of the effects of nonlinearity and nolocality
              on  solid-state reactions involving change in crystal structure.  ***
