Abstract    :
              9313773  Chang  Funds are requested for partial support for the 1993 MIT 
              Symposium/Workshop on the Physics of Space Plasmas.  The theme of  this year's
              conference is "Chaos, Stochasticity and Strong  Turbulence."  The funds will be
              used to partially cover conference  related expenses for graduate students,
              recent doctoral recipients  and visitors, including partial travel, room
              accommodations, meals  and registration costs, thereby assuring that the
              upcoming  generation of space physicists and qualified scientists will be  well
              versed in this vital area of space physics.  ***
