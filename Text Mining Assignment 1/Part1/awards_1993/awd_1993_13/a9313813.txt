Abstract    :
              9313813  Zeyen  Replacement of a 15 year old energy dispersive X ray
              Micronanalysis Unit (XRMA) on an existing scanning electron microscope, and
              addition of a detector and remote workstation to a newly acquired analytically
              configured transmission electron microscope are the proposal objectives.
              Replacement instrumentation is for campus wide research and student training on
              the St. Paul Campus of the University of Minnesota. The XRMA replacement sought
              is a workstation based analyzer capable of simultaneous energy dispersive X ray
              microanalysis from two light element detectors installed on existing
              instruments located in separate rooms. The replacement instrumentation would
              also provide for electronic image capture and storage, image analysis
              capabilities, and have a networking interface with Ethernet. The requested
              replacement instrument is an integral part of current and future campus wide
              biological and life science research needs.    On going student training and
              research capabilities would be greatly enhanced by "state of the art"
              replacement instrumentation. Current research efforts, with state and national
              priorities, benefiting immediately from the proposal for a replacement
              instrument are: a) Wood decomposition and bioprocessing of lignin removal for
              paper products; b) Disease and pest resistance in plants; c) Elemental
              distribution research in plants aimed at reducing fertilizer needs; d) Forest
              water quality and applied ecology of lakes, streams and rivers; and, e)
              Atmospheric acid deposition and pesticide residue research in soil chemistry
              and physics.    Replacement instrumentation is to be located in the 
              Cooperative Electron Optics Facility (CEOF) in the Christensen Laboratory
              building on the St. Paul Campus. This multiple user facility has been in
              operation since 1969, is supported by the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment
              Station, and serves campus wide needs in analytical electron microscopy and
              XRMA. The CEOF is centrally located on the St. Paul Campus, has 11 rooms, 2
              ultramicrotomes, vacuum evaporators, darkrooms and preparation laboratories. No
              renovation or remodeling is necessary to accept the proposed instrument
              replacement.     u    ~ s  t  # # # # # # # # # #   # # #  e# # #
