Abstract    :
              9313268  Adamowicz  This U.S.-Mexico award will support a collaboration  between
              Professor Ludwik Adamowicz of the University  of Arizona and Professor Ivan
              Ortega Blake of the  Institute of Physics of the National Autonomous 
              University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca, Mexico.   The collaborators intend
              to work on the hydrolysis of  phosphate esters using a combination of ab initio
               quantum theory, molecular dynamics, and molecular  modeling.  The goal of the
              study is to elucidate the  molecular mechanisms as well as determine the most 
              effective mediators which enhance or inhibit phosphate  bond hydrolysis.    The
              importance of the phosphate bond can hardly be  overestimated.  Its critical
              role in biological  systems in constantly upgraded: it is not only  relevant to
              the process of ATP synthesis and  hydrolysis, but also there is increasing
              evidence of  it being involved in all sorts of processes through 
              phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and as a trigger  mechanism in multiple
              second phenomena. The proposed  work will be conducted as a collaborative
              effort  through mutual contacts, visits, a student exchange  program, and
              electronic communication.  The long term  goal of the project is to advance our
              understanding of  a crucial biological process as a source of bioenergy.  ***
