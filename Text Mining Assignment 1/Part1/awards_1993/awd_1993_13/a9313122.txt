Abstract    :
                      9313122  Bazant  The aim of the Workshop will be to provide a forum for
              an in-depth  discussion of the frontiers of research and a critical appraisal
              on  the current state-of-the-art and promising research directions.   Recently,
              a great surge of interest took place in this subject,  with an exploding
              literature.  This increased activity has been  stimulated by the needs of
              rebuilding national infrastructure as  well as increasing competitiveness of
              the U.S. industry in the  field of materials.  Advances in the subject may be
              expected to  lead to improved high strength concrete, tougher ceramics, safer 
              design of structures subjected to overload such as earthquakes,  design of more
              reliable machine parts, etc.  The symposium is  expected to facilitate
              interdisciplinary dialogue between  scientists working in structural
              engineering and concrete  technology, materials science, continuum mechanics
              and applied  mechanics, and to stimulate new developments.
