Abstract    :
              9313535  Bustos  Since its establishment in 1966, the Department of Biological 
              Sciences at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC),  has been
              committed to excellence in plant research.  The focus of  plant research
              projects has ranged from the physiology and  biochemistry of photosynthesis to
              plant development and molecular  biology.  Recent developments in plant
              biotechnology,  particularly transgenic plant research, require specialized 
              facilities that provide better environmental control capabilities  and
              containment of transgenic plant material.  Many of the  experimental techniques
              required for this research are impossible  to achieve with the existing
              conditions at UMBC's greenhouse  facility.    This ARI award will provide
              funding for the modernization of the  greenhouse facility.  New HVAC units,
              supplemental lighting and  an automatic drip-feed watering system will be
              provided, within  the facility, to sustain near optimal growth conditions
              annually.  The renovations will make more efficient use of available space, 
              furnish a wider range of growth habitants,  provide separate  areas for
              preparation and sterilization of growth media, and the  inspection and
              treatment of plant specimens.  Improving the  facility will allow the
              university to be in compliance with  federal regulations regarding the growth
              and harvest conditions  of genetically engineered plants.  Researchers and
              students will  be able to work on ten different species of plants, including 
              Arabidopsis.  The renovated facility will enhance the  university's ability to
              continue to attract students and faculty  with diverse backgrounds into this
              important field of science and  provide state-of-the-art training.  ***
