Abstract    :
              9313650  Bates  Research activities focus upon metal-semiconductor composites
              for  the detection of optical radiation in the 3-5um wavelength portion  of the
              electromagnetic spectrum.  Two important detectors used for  thermal imaging in
              this atmospheric window include Hg1-x Cdx Te  (x=0.4 to 0.3) and Ptx Si
              Schottky barrier devices.  (The Ptx Si  alloy composition varies with the
              sintering temperature.)  The  former material has attractive fundamental
              properties such as a low  intrinsic carrier concentration with no~1014 cm-3, a
              high electron  mobility of ue~ 105 cm 2/volt-sec. and long minority carrier 
              lifetimes on the order of 10-6 seconds associated with intrinsic  recombination
              processes.  These combine to give systems using this  material large quantum
              efficiencies of 60%.  Quantum efficiencies  are given on the basis of absorbed
              photons.  Disadvantages include  nonuniform properties in two-dimensional
              arrays and poor mechanical  integrity.  The latter material, though very
              uniform in its  properties, suffers from low quantum efficiencies of about 1%
              for  thermal imaging and are normally operated at 80 K to suppress the  dark
              current.  These factors have contributed to the lack of their  more widespread
              use in the 3-5um wavelength range.  The concept involved in these studies is
              the use of buried Schottky  barriers, as produced by dispersing small metal
              particles typically  5-50nm in size, in semiconducting matrices for the
              detection of  infrared radiation.  These structures avoid the trade-off between
               absorption and quantum efficiency in the choice of metal thickness  in the
              planar structures which contributes to their low quantum  efficiencies.  The
              system to be investigated is PtxSi particles in  a p-type silicon matrix and
              this choice is based on the following:   (a) like the planar structures of the
              same materials this system  can be made sensitive to radiation in the 3-5um
              wavelength range;  (b) these structures may be produced by well established
              solid-  state growth techniques; ( c) they may be, like the planar 
              strucutures, readily incorporated as an integral part of a larger  system using
              silicon-based technology and; (d) properties such as  quantum efficiency
              responsivity and uniformity may be readily  compared to the planar structure as
              a test of the theory involoved  and the feasibility of reducing it to practice.
