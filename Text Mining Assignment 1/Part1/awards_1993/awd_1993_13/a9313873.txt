Abstract    :
              CTS-9313873  University of Texas-Austin  Douglas R. Lloyd        ABSTRACT     
              Development of a homogeneous theoretical model to predict species rejection
              coefficients for multicomponent electrolyte solutions during reverse osmosis
              comprises the main thrust of this research.  The new theory incorporates the
              calculation of fixed charged density in the membrane during reverse osmosis and
              its dependence on ion coefficients will be calculated as a function of
              electrolyte concentrations, pH, and applied pressure and then compared to
              experimental measurements.  The general theory will be extended to accommodate
              concentration polarization and membranes of different structures.    Results
              could enhance the use of reverse osmosis to develop water resources in parts of
              the country, contributing to civil infrastructure, and facilitate hybrid
              methods for environmental treatment of contamination sites.
