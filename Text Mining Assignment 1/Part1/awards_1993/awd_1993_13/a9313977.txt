Abstract    :
              9313977  Castor  Reversed micelles hold much promise as a  means of carrying out
               selective liquid-liquid extraction of  proteins from solution  mixtures such
              that the desired protein is  obtained in a purer and  more concentrated form
              than the original  feed.  Reversed  micellar-organic (RM-ORG) phase separation 
              could have significant  utility in the primary purification or  initial
              fractionation of  biosynthetic protein production processes.   The continuous
              flow  RM-ORG process developed during Phase I was  designed to displace 
              conventional low resolution chromatographic  purification  processes which
              cause losses in yield and  increased manufacturing  costs.    During Phase II,
              process stream parameters  such as surfactant  concentration and aqueous stream
              pH are to be  optimized.  These  parameters play key roles in determining 
              protein solubilization  in reversed micelles.  A continuous flow  RM-ORG
              prototype is to  be designed, constructed, and tested.  Based  on this
              information,  an economic analysis of the prototype is to  be performed.
