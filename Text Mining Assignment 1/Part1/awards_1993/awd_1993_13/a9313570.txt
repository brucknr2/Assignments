Abstract    :
              9313570  Vedula  This award will allow Iowa State University to renovate two 
              floors of a 65-year old building into a dynamic focal point  for
              materials-related research activities.  The Materials  Science and Engineering
              Department at this institution has  23 faculty members that make use of this
              research facility.  Their research and educational activities involve 
              metallurgy, ceramics, magnetic materials, and nondestructive  evaluation and
              with emerging strengths in electronic,  photonic, bio- and composite materials.
              This program in  materials science is in a dynamic stage as evidenced by the 
              70% increase in graduate student enrollment, from 36 to 62,  during the past
              two years.  The Department is well funded by  federal sources.    The
              renovation approach to be used is based on a new concept  of "shared" research
              space, which is believed to be  particularly relevant for materials science
              because of its  interdisciplinary thrust.  "Generic" labs will provide  common
              services to many researchers, and a good portion of  the space will be
              renovated for use as "modular" space for  individual research groups, depending
              on their current  needs.  This method of space allocation is expected to be 
              responsive to the dynamic nature of the field and changes in  faculty
              composition and interests as well as to provide a  convenient format for
              interactions with other disciplines of  science and engineering.  Finally, this
              modernization is  expected to become a major asset for attracting more U.S. 
              students, particularly minorities and women, to materials  science studies.
