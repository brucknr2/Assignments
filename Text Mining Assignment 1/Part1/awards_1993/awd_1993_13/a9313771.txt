Abstract    :
                Larson  The research centers on experimental studies of the  photodetachment
              of negative ions in external fields through the  production and detection of
              wavepackets using picosecond and  subpicosecond laser pulses.  Penning traps
              are used to contain  the negative ions.  A second project, the study of two
              electron  correlations in alkali negative ions will shed light on the 
              threshold laws for the ejection of two electrons by  electromagnetic radiation.
