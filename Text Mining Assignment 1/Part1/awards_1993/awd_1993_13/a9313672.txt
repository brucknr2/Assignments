Abstract    :
              9313672  Marcus    Populations of Calanus finmarchicus constitute a major
              portion of  the zooplankton biomass in the Northwestern Atlantic, and comprise 
              a fundamental food source for the cod and haddock that live on  Georges Bank. 
              The springtime arrival of this copepod on the Bank  is reportedly due to
              recruitment of fifth stage copepodites from  the deeper waters of the Gulf of
              Maine, where they overwinter in a  state of dormancy or diapause.  Recruitment
              success depends, to a  large extent, on the duration of this diapause stage. 
              Knowing the  effects of environmental factors on the timing of diapause 
              induction and termination, and the internal morphological changes  that occur
              throughout this critical life stage, will contribute to  a better understanding
              of the physical and biological factors that  regulate the recruitment process
              of Calanus finmarchicus onto  Georges Bank.  The research to be conducted under
              this project is  an in-depth investigation of ways in which variations of 
              temperature and photoperiod may influence the physiological  processes that
              control and regulate diapause in Calanus  finmarchicus.  A specially designed
              system for culturing multiple  generations of C. finmarchicus will be used to
              subject the juvenile  stages to various combinations of temperature and
              photoperiod.  Light microscopy and TEM will be used to confirm the identity of 
              the cue-receptive organs and neuroendocrine sites that control the  cessation
              and induction of molting.  Cytological features of gonad  development in
              diapausing and nondiapausing individuals will be  described and compared in
              both laboratory and field populations.  ***
