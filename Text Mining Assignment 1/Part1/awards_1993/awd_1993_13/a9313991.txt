Abstract    :
                9313991  Aller  Planetary nebulae represent material which was ejected from
              highly  evolved stars.  Its composition contains clues about the evolution  of
              stars and the ejecta are an important source of heavy elements  in the
              interstellar medium.  The abundances of elements in  planetary nebulae will be
              determined using high quality spectra now  available from the Lick Observatory
              Echelle Spectrograph and new  modeling techniques.  ***
