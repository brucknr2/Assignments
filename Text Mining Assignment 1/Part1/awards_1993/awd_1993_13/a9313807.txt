Abstract    :
              This award supports an exploratory visit to the islands of Sao Tome            
              & Principe and Annobon in the Gulf of Guinea for the purposes of               
              evaluating the possibility of using massive corals from these                  
              localities for paleoclimatic reconstructions of the Subsahara and              
              Northern Africa.  Corals will be analyzed to assess whether these              
              localities reveal know histories of drought and excess rain fall in            
              the subsahara.  The nature of this research is exploratory because             
              it is contingent upon there being corals of the suitable size and              
              age.
