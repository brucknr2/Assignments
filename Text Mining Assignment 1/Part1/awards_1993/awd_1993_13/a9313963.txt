Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research on the political campaign leading up to the Spanish              
              election in June of 1993 is part of a large cross-national study on            
              the manner in which citizens obtain information during political               
              campaigns.  It focuses on the roles played by secondary                        
              organizations and personal contacts with friends, co-workers and               
              family as well as the impact of the mass media on the channeling               
              and structuring of political information to potential voters.  This            
              study, as part of the larger Comparative National Elections                    
              Project, will enhance our understanding of the flow of information             
              in campaigns.  The effectiveness of this communications process is             
              vital to citizens making informed judgements in their voting                   
              decisions and is, therefore, critical to the health of the                     
              democratic process.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The funding will be used to expand the sample size of the surveys              
              so that conclusions drawn on the basis of these data will be more              
              reliable.  The researchers will archive campaign materials,                    
              especially the media broadcasts that appear to play such a major               
              role in modern campaigns, so that the flow of information can be               
              accurately assessed after the campaign.  These data would not be               
              retrievable without immediate support for the project.
