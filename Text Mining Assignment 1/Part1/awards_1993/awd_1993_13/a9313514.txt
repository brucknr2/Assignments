Abstract    :
              9313514  Makarewicz        The Biology Department of the State University of New
              York (SUNY) at  Brockport occupies Lennon Hall, a classroom building
              constructed in 1966.  Since its construction, the university has made a
              commitment to faculty  research, but this building is poorly equipped to
              support research and research  training activities. Most faculty research labs
              are classrooms in which tables  have been used as lab benches. These labs lack
              the basic electrical power,  fume hoods, and environmental controls that are
              necessary for modern  biological research. The university plans an extensive
              renovation of Lennon Hall  which will provide an upgraded electrical system to
              the building, installation of  fume hoods, a building-wide replacement of the
              heating, ventilation, and air  conditioning system, and installation of
              adequate laboratory benches and  cabinetry.        The planned renovation of
              Lennon Hall will enable faculty and students to  pursue research projects that
              have previously been impossible due to building  conditions. The renovation
              will create safe and healthy environments for work  with chemicals and
              biological reagents, and will provide suitable support  systems for advanced
              research instrumentation. It will promote joint faculty-  student research
              projects, and as a result will attract students to the study of  and careers in
              science.  ***
