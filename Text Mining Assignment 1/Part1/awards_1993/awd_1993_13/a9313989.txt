Abstract    :
              9313989  Whitmire    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in inorganic and organometallic chemistry between Kenton H. 
              Whitmire, Rice University, and Jean-Yves Saillard, University of  Rennes.  The
              objective of their research is to perform  experimental and theoretical studies
              on a class of large cobalt-  bismuth cluster compounds, an organometallic
              cluster recently  discovered by Dr. Whitmire's group.  Large cluster compounds
              are  important for studies on main-group and transition metals, and on 
              separating molecules and solids.    The U.S. investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in  the synthesis and characterization of large bismuth
              cobalt  clusters and in experimental studies of main group elements and 
              transition metals. This is complemented by the French group's  expertise in
              small organometallic cluster molecules and extended  solid state structures,
              which are important to understanding  bonding of these molecules. They have
              worked on methods for   determining orbital structure for both organometallic
              cluster  complexes and extended solid state arrays.  This project will  advance
              understanding of the formation of complex molecules of  main group and
              transition metal atoms and their chemical  reactivity.  ***
