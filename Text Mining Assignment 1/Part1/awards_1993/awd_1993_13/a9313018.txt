Abstract    :
                   This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supporram  
              supports studies by Luis Echegoyen at the University of Miami   focused on the
              synthesis and characterization of  various novel  fullevel    fullerenes.  
              Derivatized fullerenes having appended   calixarenes and crown ethers will be
              prepared, and the   complexing and electron transfer properties of the
              resulting   species will be characterized using electrochemical methods, as
              well a as   well as electron spin resonance spectroscopy.   
              Electrocrystallization of novel materials based on these   compounds will be
              attempted.  %%%       The fullerenes are a new class of compounds that have
              been discoveen   discovered and investigated over the last several years. 
              These specieese   species are spherically-shaped arrays of carbon atoms which  
              demonstrate unique chemical and materials properties.  Prof.   Echegoyen will
              investigate the properties of a novel subset of   these new compounds.  These
              studies should provide a better   understanding of the structure and electronic
              properties of   these novel species, and could help in suggesting important  
              applications for these new materials.  ***
