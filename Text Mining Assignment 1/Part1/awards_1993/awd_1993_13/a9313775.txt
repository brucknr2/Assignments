Abstract    :
               An important class of practical parallel computers consists of  machines
              comprising many large grained processors.  These  processors execute 
              asynchronously and memory is assumed to be  distributed.  Trying to execute a 
              general n-thread parallel  program P on such a parallel system poses
              theoretical  and  practical challenges.  One must provide mechanisms for 
              implementing the  synchronization barriers, for load sharing and  balancing
              amongst the  processors, and for program executing that  respects memory
              locality.    The  approach used in this research is to define algorithms  and a
              program transformation  (compilation) T so that T(P) executes correctly and
              efficiently on any P.  This simulated  execution does not require any
              specialized hardware or operating  system mechanisms in the target machine.   
              Of particular interest is the case  that the parallel program is 
              large-grained, i.e. that in each parallel step a  substantial  block of
              instructions is executed on some or most of the parallel  threads.  It is
              assumed that the parallel program is already  optimized so as to  make the
              blocks of code within the parallel  step quite large.  This project  studies
              the most general case  of large grained parallel programs, paying  particular
              attention  to memory locality and to memory fault-tolerance,  employing 
              randomization.  A further goal is to achieve Las Vegas style  results, i.e.
              small expected running time and no errors.
