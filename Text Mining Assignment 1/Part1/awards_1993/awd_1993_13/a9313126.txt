Abstract    :
              9313126  Lewis       The broad objective of the research is to improve the
              quality,   reproducibility, and speed of ceramic-based multi-chip module   
              manufacturing.  An interdisciplinary effort will simultaneously    focus on
              materials and processing issues, and on automated visual   inspection of
              tape-cast ceramic layers.  Currently, a scientific    understanding of the
              effects of materials composition on both    suspension rheology and as-cast
              properties (both macrostructural    and microstructural) is lacking.  This will
              be addressed by an    experimental program which (1) characterizes the
              rheological    properties as a function of suspension composition and time, and
                 (2) determines the microstructural variations within the layers.    Insights
              gained from this experimental program will be used to    derive statistical
              models for defect occurrence, which will then    drive the inspection process. 
              An inspection methodology that    combines process knowledge with computer
              vision and image    processing techniques does not yet exist.          The end
              result of the research will be improved dimensional  control and reproducibilty
              and automated visual inspection of  tape-cast sheets.  In addition, this work
              will provide a basic  understanding of the relationship between the materials
              system,  processing parameters, and microstructural development that is 
              readily applicable to the production of advanced ceramic  components.  Such
              understanding may allow the production of more  reliable electronic devices and
              assemblies.
