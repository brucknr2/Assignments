Abstract    :
              9313731  Koul  Description:  This proposal will support travel  for a small
              group  of U.S. statisticians to participate in a  workshop: "Analysis of 
              Censored Data, University of Poona, Pune,  India, December 1994."   The
              Department of Statistics, University of  Poona, is the leading  research center
              among Indian universities and  is second only to  the Indian Statistical
              Institute, Calcutta.   Statistical  inference is the thrust area of research in
               this Department.  The  workshop will be hosted by the Department of 
              Statistics at the  new IUCAA facility on campus at Poona  University.  The
              organizers  are Hira Koul, Michigan State University and  J.V. Deshpande, Head 
              of the Department of Statistics at Poona  University.  The purpose  of the
              workshop is to initiate interest in this  area of research  among leading
              Indian inference statisticians.   Censored data  arise out of industrial,
              biomedical and  ecological survivorship  studies.  The stress will be on the
              need for  analyzing censored  data and the most recent methodologies used for 
              the design of  collection and analysis of such data.    Scope:  This workshop
              will be the first  international gathering  on censoring to take place in
              India.  Life  testing/survival  analysis have become critically important as 
              India seeks to  modernize the biomedical and industrial  sectors.  Improving
              the  quality and reliability of manufactured  products is vital in 
              accomplishing this goal.  Additionally, the  opportunity to  exchange ideas
              with leading statisticians from  Germany, Holland,  Finland, and Canada will be
              highly beneficial  to U.S.  participants.  Post-doctoral and women  scientists
              from the U.S.  will be well represented at the workshop.     ***
