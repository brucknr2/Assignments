Abstract    :
              CTS-9313913  University of Iowa  David G. Rethwisch      ABSTRACT    The
              enhanced capabilities of NMR with a pulsed field gradient NMR probe will permit
              the measurement of solute mobility as well as solubility in polymers.  Direct
              comparison of measurements for polymer samples from different physical
              processing methods will be made for better understanding of structure function
              relationships.  Particular applications will be aimed at the improvement of
              non-porous polymeric membranes for gas separations.    Gases currently used in
              the production of foams contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer and to
              global warming so that alternative gases or processes must be identified. 
              Membrane-based gas separation methods offer promise as a lower energy, more
              economical approach to the production of commercially and medically important
              gases.   .N  T""   AUTOEXECBAT            X  J     BURKA   PRE            dP
