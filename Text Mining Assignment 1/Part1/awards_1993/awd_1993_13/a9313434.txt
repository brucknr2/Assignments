Abstract    :
              9313434  Clough       The Biology and Chemistry Departments of the University 
              of Richmond are housed in Gottwald Science Center, which was  constructed in
              1978 primarily for classroom use. Since that  time, a significant number of
              younger faculty members have  been added to the staff, and their high levels of
              research  activity are poorly served by the Science Center's  laboratory
              spaces. In particular, there are an insufficient  number of efficient fume
              hoods, and the building's  ventilation system and hazardous material storage
              rooms are  inadequate. To address these concerns, the University will  upgrade
              the building's HVAC system, modernize the chemical  storage facilities, and add
              24 new fume hoods.       The planned upgrading of Gottwald Science Center will 
              have several significant effects: 1) the safety of students,  staff, and
              faculty in the Center will be safeguarded; 2)  research instrumentation will
              have more suitable  environments; 3) the scope and quality of faculty research 
              will be increased; and 4) joint student-faculty research  projects will be
              easier to pursue. These changes will serve  to attract more students into
              scientific careers.  ***
