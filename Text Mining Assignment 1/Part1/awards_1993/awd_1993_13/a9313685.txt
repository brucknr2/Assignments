Abstract    :
              9313685  Hinton  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and 
              Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at  the University
              of Arkansas in Fayetteville in the purchase of a  workstation cluster of IBM RS
              6000/370 computers.  This  equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including  the following:    1.  NMR Chemical Shift Calculations  a.  Develop
              GIAO (Gauge Including Atomic Orbital)      NMR chemical shift code for network
              parallel processing.  b.  Develop a parallel NMR chemical shielding program
              using      local density functional (LDF) theory.    2.  Methods for Molecular
              Potential Surfaces  a.  Efficient multiconfigurational methods for potential
              energy      surfaces:  UNO-CAS and generalized Miller-Plesset      Perturbation
              theory.  b.  Dynamical correlation methods for large molecules.  %%%    A
              workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is  a new way to
              satisfy the computing needs of chemistry  departments.  Such a "computer
              network" also serves as a  development environment for new theoretical codes
              and  algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and  visualization
              facilities and supports research in  state-of-the-art applications of parallel
              processing.  ***
