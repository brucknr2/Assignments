Abstract    :
              This grant is a renewal of Professor Crooks' fundamental                       
              investigation of molecular recognition phenomena observed in                   
              organized chemical systems.  The project in the Analytical and                 
              Surface Chemistry Program will involve experimental and                        
              theoretical studies of thin films of organosulfur compounds                    
              chemisorbed on gold surfaces, i. e., so-called self-assembled                  
              monolayers (SAMs).  The investigations will center on the                      
              electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between probe                  
              molecules and the adsorbed monolayers.  The goal of the                        
              research is to develop molecular recognition strategies which                  
              can be used for chemical sensors.

              Professor Crooks and his colleagues will investigate the                       
              chemistry of self-assembled monolayers of organosulfur                         
              compounds adsorbed on gold surfaces. The research results will                 
              be used for the development of new chemical sensors based on                   
              molecular recognition phenomena, new electronic materials and                  
              innovative lithographic techniques.
