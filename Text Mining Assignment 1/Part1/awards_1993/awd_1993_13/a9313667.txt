Abstract    :
                   Nine years' observations of 33 sunlike stars offer tantalizing            
              evidence that the sun's potential for long-term brightness                     
              variability is significantly understate by measurements of solar               
              irradiance variations since 1978.  These stellar observations also             
              show that changes in visual brightness and magnetic activity are               
              not simply correlated, as has been presumed in reconstructions of              
              long-term solar irradiance fluctuations from sunspot and other                 
              solar data.                                                                    
                   This project will extend the observational time series for                
              three years (that is, comparable with one full "solar" cycle),                 
              providing a unique unbroken set of precision photometric                       
              measurements at 472 nm and 551 nm.  In close collaboration with the            
              separately funded HK program at Mount Wilson Observatory that                  
              monitors the chromospheric (magnetic) activity of these stars, the             
              PI will compare magnetic and brightness variations of the sun and              
              similar stars in an effort to characterize long-term solar                     
              variability.                                                                   
                   Stellar and solar brightness variations are clearly linked to             
              chromospheric activity, but the relationship is complex and                    
              requires further elucidation.  The PI will establish the morphology            
              and statistics of long-term brightness variability with particular             
              regard to the question of poorly understood phenomena such as the              
              solar "Maunder minimum."
