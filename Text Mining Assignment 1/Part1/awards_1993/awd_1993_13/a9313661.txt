Abstract    :
              CTS-9313661  Cleveland State University  Orhan Talu        ABSTRACT    The
              single crystal method of determining diffusivity in micropores will be modified
              to permit concentration-driven measurements at constant pressure and to include
              the capability for isotopic labeling by the incorporation of a mass
              spectrometer for analysis.  Investigations performed with the single crystal
              method may help to resolve differences between macroscopic (e.g. gavimetric)
              and microscopic (e.g. NMR) - based estimates of diffusivities.    Diffusion of
              gases in absorbants for separations and in packed beds for reactors is
              important for the design and operation of many industrial chemical processes.
