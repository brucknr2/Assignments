Abstract    :
              9313920  Yngvesson  A joint research project is undertaken between researchers
              at Moscow State Pedagogical University (MSPU), and University of Massachusetts
              at Amherst (UM/A).  The two groups have during the last few years separately
              developed hot electron devices which have the potential for realizing a new
              generation of receivers and detectors for the range 0.5-3 THz (wavelengths 600
              um to 100 um), with much lower noise temperature than any present receiver. 
              MSPU has concentrated on thin film superconductors, while UM/A has utilized the
              two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) medium at a semiconductor hetero-junction. 
              The basic principles of the two devices are quite similar: a heated medium
              consisting of quasi-particles (in the superconductor case), or 2DEG electrons,
              is created, in which detection or mixing takes place.  Recent work at both
              institution has resulted in available bandwidth with demonstrations GHz range.
              MSPU has shown that their devices mix up to at least 1.5 THz.  A comparative
              study of inelastic relaxation processes in the two media is proposed, thus
              expanding the basic knowledge of inelastic relaxation processes a Howing
              development of optimum hot electron-based THz mixers.  The two most promising
              materials known at the present time, NbN films and 2DEG at heterostructures of
              GaAs/A1GaAs, have been singled out for specific comparison.  ***
