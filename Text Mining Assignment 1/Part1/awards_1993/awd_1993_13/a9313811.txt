Abstract    :
              This RUI program will measure frequency shifts due to the  effects of hyperfine
              structure during low energy electron  spin exchange collisions between ground
              state hydrogen atoms  in a cryogenic hydrogen maser operating near 11K with
              solid  neon storage surfaces.  Monte Carlo techniques will be used  to model
              all other potential perturbations of the  oscillation frequency of the hydrogen
              maser and the  cryogenic hydrogen maser being used at the Harvard Center  for
              Astrophysics to measure the hyperfine induced collision  shifts near 0.5.  The
              results will probe the breakdown of  the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in low
              energy atomic  collisions and the degree to which collisions between  hydrogen
              atoms may limit the potential stability of  cryogenic hydrogen maser frequency
              standards.
