Abstract    :
              9313387  Hutzler       The Environmental Engineering programs at Michigan 
              Technological University have grown substantially over the past ten  years.  To
              accommodate this growth, the university has assigned  research space that has
              been vacated by the Department of  Metallurgical Engineering.  While some of
              the space is adequate for  environmental engineering research, much of the
              existing facility  is either outdated or unsuitable for research activities. 
              Those  laboratories that are adequate for research were equipped in 1968  when
              the building was constructed, and thus are severely limited  for modernized
              research use.  Much of the present research is  conducted at several locations
              on and off campus.       This ARI award will provide funding for the renovation
              of this  space to bring it to the standards necessary for the increasing 
              volume of research being conducted by the environmental engineering  faculty
              and students.  This includes the renovation of laboratory  space, installation
              of laboratory utilities, and the acquisition  and installation of fixed
              equipment.  Once the renovations are  completed, faculty, students, and staff
              will be capable of  performing research that they are presently committed to as
              well as  conduct research that they would like to do but cannot within the 
              existing infrastructure.  The facility will be able to accommodate  additional
              faculty and students in the renovated area, allowing for  continued growth and
              increased productivity within the  Environmental Engineering program.  ***
