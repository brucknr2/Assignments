Abstract    :
              Frank  9313872    Vertical migration has been described as one of the dominant 
              behavioral patterns on earth.  The influence of this  phenomenon on the
              structure of marine ecosystems is well  documented, and defining the
              environmental variables which  control this behavior is critical to developing
              predictive  models of animal distributions in the ocean.  It is  generally
              accepted that light is the variable which exerts  the greatest influence over
              migratory behavior.    This study will conduct experiments on deep-sea species,
               whose ambient light field contains few variables and is  therefore more easily
              reproduced.  Due to the recent  discovery of near-UV light sensitivy in several
              species of  deep-sea, vertically migrating shrimp, in situ measurements  of
              both visible and near -UV light will be made and utilized  to provide a
              calibrated light field for behavioral and  electrophysiological experiments
              designed to define the  critical photic determinants of vertical migration.
