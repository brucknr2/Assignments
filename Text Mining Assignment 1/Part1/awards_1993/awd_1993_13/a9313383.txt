Abstract    :
              9313383  Hartmann         This project investigates the climate variability on 
              intraseasonal time scales using models and observations.  The  natural
              low-frequency variability generated within the atmosphere  an its interaction
              with the oceanic mixed layer is studied with a  hierarchy of models.  The role
              of transient synoptic scale eddies  in maintaining a low-frequency atmospheric
              variability and in  driving heat exchange with the ocean will be investigated. 
              The  tropical intraseasonal oscillation with a time scale of 40-50 days  and
              its interaction with midlatitude weather anomalies is also  investigated with
              models.  A dynamic/thermodynamics mechanism for  setting the long time scale of
              the tropical intraseasonal  oscillation will be further investigated using a
              model to be  developed, which will be directed toward efficient examination of 
              dynamic/thermodynamic/hydrologic feedbacks within the tropics.  To  complement
              this modeling effort, a detailed diagnostic analysis of  the interactions among
              large-scale dynamics, convection,  evaporation, radiation and SST will be
              undertaken using a variety  of data sets including in situ surface
              observations, satellite data  and meteorological analyses.       This research
              is important because it aims at further  improvements in our understanding of
              climate processes that  regulate seasonal and interannual climate variability.
