Abstract    :
              9313735  DESHMUKH  Description:  This research proposes a series  of
              calculations to explore the ionizing  interactions of electromagnetic radiation
              and  charged particles with atoms and ions.  The  collaborators are Steven
              Manson of Georgia  State University and Pranawa Deshmukh of the   Indian
              Institute of Technology, Madras.  During  the initial phase of the project, the
              Indian  collaborator will be supported with travel and  living expenses to do
              developmental work using  the computational facilities at Georgia State 
              University.  The proposed research will study  i) the influence of relativistic
              interactions  in the photoionization of high-z atoms using  the RRPA formalism
              with enough channels to  obviate truncation errors, ii) investigate the  inner
              shell threshold behavior of  photoionization cross sections, iii)  explore  the
              photoionization of ions with the RRPA  technology, iv) examine the systematics
              of  generalized oscillator strengths for neutral  atoms, excited states, and
              atomic ions.      Scope:  This research will provide training for  graduate and
              advanced undergraduate students in  the methods of calculating and
              understanding  atomic and molecular structure and collisions.   The techniques
              and computer codes developed  will strengthen the theoretical physics program 
              at the collaborating institutions.  The results  will provide further insight
              into the basic  nature of these fundamental atomic processes  which are
              important in plasma physics,  atmospheric, solar, and astrophysics, radiation 
              physics and therapy, and for studies of  possible x-ray and nuclear-pumped
              laser  mechanisms.   ***
