              dissertation research proposal by a Russian student at Stanford received very
              enthusiastic reviews.  The student has received some funding from the Wenner
              Gren foundation.  I calculated that about $2,898 of his budget was not covered
              by his other funding.  Dr. Noel Broadbent (DPP) was disposed to co-fund this
              project, but with such a small award it hardly makes sense to split the
              funding.   The student is already in Russia doing his research, but his adviser
              will visit him in the field and will bring him the equipment that NSF is
              funding.  (Dr. Broadbent, who has experience doing research in polar regions,
              felt that the request for $150 for a parka was not justified.)    I recommend
              that this proposal be funded.     DAMmmm d, yyyy    PG   9313289  Collier    
              This project involves the dissertation research of a Russian native student of
              cultural anthropology getting his Phd from Stanford University.  The project
              studies the role of the Soviet state in transforming notions of ethnicity and
              fair economic exchange among a group of forest hunters and reindeer herders of
              Subarctic Siberia.  Using archival research and ethnographic methods, the
              student will investigate the growth of ethnic solidarity and out-group
              discrimination in this local society, and the relation of these value changes
              to the local group's incorporation into the larger Russian economy.     This
              kind of research is important because the growth of local ethnic identities and
              ethnic-based discrimination is an ugly fact of life in many regions of the
              world.  In-depth case studies such as this one can reveal the role of the
              central state in fomenting ethnic distinctions, and can help decision makers
              formulate policies to moderate the problems and conflicts such discrimination
              causes.  ***  LBRV 4    LBLG STU                                      LBCD
