Abstract    :
              9313801  Pesnell  Collisions strongly affect the dynamics of the thermosphere
              and  ionosphere.  The solar wind induces electric fields in the  ionosphere,
              accelerating the ions, which then accelerate the  neutral gas through
              collisions.   The reverse is also true.  If the  neutral species are
              accelerated by a pressure gradient or other  force, the ions are also
              accelerated.  One example is the diurnal  tide, which propagates up through the
              thermosphere.  The periodic  neutral winds act as a dynamo, generating global
              electrical  currents.    One important quantity for each of those interactions
              is the  collision frequency.  When the collision frequency is large for a 
              certain scattering process, those two gases are dynamically  coupled. 
              Unfortunately, the relevant collision cross sections are extremely  difficult
              to measure.  Laboratory measurements have been done only  at energies
              substantially greater than those found in the  thermosphere (Stebbings, 1964). 
              It is necessary to use quantum  mechanical calculation to extend theoretically
              the measurements to  the low energies of the thermosphere.    The transport
              coefficients are calculated as part of the proposed  research.  The theoretical
              values of these transport coefficients  will be compared to published
              coefficients and with empirically  derived coefficients.  The discrepancy
              between published empirical  and theoretical collision frequencies is on the
              order of a factor  of three.  An estimate of the error in the other transport 
              coefficients will be made based on this discrepancy and the  empirical
              coefficients.  Data from the Dynamics Explorer 2  satellite will be used to
              give empirical values of the collision  frequency and thermal diffusion
              coefficient.  Simplified momentum  and energy equations will be used in that
              analysis.  ***
