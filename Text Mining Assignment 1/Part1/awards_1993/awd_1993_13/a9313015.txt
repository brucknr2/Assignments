Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              To aid in the implementation of the Environmental Protection                   
              Agency's priorities for source reduction and recycling, the PI                 
              plans to develop a systematic procedure for identifying the                    
              source of treatment problems in terms of the design decisions                  
              that are the cause of that problem (such as the addition of                    
              steam as a reactor diluent).  By identifying the design                        
              decision as the cause, an alternative decision, that will                      
              avoid the necessity for treatment or disposal, can be                          
              identified.  This approach is applicable to both continuous                    
              and batch processes, but since the stream flows are much                       
              larger in continuous processes, much larger reductions in                      
              emissions should be possible.                                                  
                                                                                             
              A hierarchical decision procedure will be implemented that                     
              provides a simple way of identifying potential pollution                       
              problems early in the development stages of a new process.                     
              The procedure focuses on the decisions required to complete a                  
              design.  If alternative decisions are made, process                            
              alternatives are generated.  Some of the decisions affect the                  
              exit streams from (and the feeds to) the process, and in some                  
              cases these exit streams can have an adverse environmental                     
              impact.  Hence, of one  can make decisions, i.e. find                          
              alternatives, that do not lead to pollution problems, one can                  
              develop cleaner processes.  The hierarchical decision                          
              procedure can also be used to decompose existing designs;                      
              then, process alternatives that eleminate existing pollution                   
              sources can be identified. ***
