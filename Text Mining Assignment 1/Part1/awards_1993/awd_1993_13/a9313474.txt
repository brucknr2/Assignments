Abstract    :
              9313474  Renaghan  The J.W. Wilson Lab at Brown University houses a large number
              of  researchers in molecular biology and biochemistry.  Twenty three  faculty,
              24 postdoctoral fellows, and about 57 graduate students  make use of the
              research facilities in this building that have not  been renovated in 31 years.
               Due to the age of the building, it is  unsafe, unreliable, has serious
              capacity and energy problems and  the general environmental conditions do not
              attract scientists or  students.  This award will allow Brown University to
              renovate and  modernize the research and research training facilities in this 
              building and impact the research infrastructure by: 1) providing  for an
              uninterrupted and stable research environment while removing  restrictions
              currently in place on hoods and research equipment; 2)  providing for an
              optimal HVAC system thereby creating a healthy  environment for performance of
              research and reduction of downtime;  3) providing for flexible and reliable use
              of mechanical and  electrical research equipment in laboratories; 4) providing
              for  compliance with all applicable building and environmental codes; 5) 
              providing greater opportunity for enhanced preparation and improved 
              productivity of faculty and student researchers; and 6) providing  a safe and
              stable working environment for graduate, undergraduate  and postdoctoral
              trainees.  The researchers at this institution  have an excellent research
              record in biotechnology research areas  and the modernization project to be
              undertaken will greatly enable  their efforts.  ***
