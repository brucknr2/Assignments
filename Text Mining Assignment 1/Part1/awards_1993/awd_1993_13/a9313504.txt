Abstract    :
              Taylor       The University of Louisville s Department of Biology occupies the
              Life  Sciences Building, which was built in the 1960s when the institution s
              focus was on  teaching rather than research. As a result, the subsequent
              increase in research activity  by the faculty and students in the department
              has been hampered by the building s  configuration and support systems, which
              were built to serve classroom and teaching  lab functions. The University plans
              to renovate a portion of the basement of the Life  Sciences Building to
              accommodate modern research in microbiology and  molecular  biology. The area
              will be reconfigured for group research, including undergraduate  and graduate
              students, and building systems (fume hoods, lighting, plumbing,  electrical,
              and ventilation) will be modernized. Walk-in growth chambers will be  installed
              to support research and research training in microbiology.       The renovation
              will resolve safety issues stemming from the use of hazardous  materials and
              will create environments suitable for state-of-the-art research  instruments.
              Overall research productivity of the department will increase as a result  of
              the renovation. Reconfiguring the area will increase the number of students who
               can take part in faculty research, and as a result a greater number of
              students will be  attracted to scientific careers.
