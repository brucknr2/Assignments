Abstract    :
              Investigators at the Polar Science Center of the University of                 
              Washington will purchase a quantity of Submarine Ship launch                   
              eXpendable CTDs (SSXCTD) and fabricate a boom for deploying other              
              scientific instruments from a U.S. Navy submarine.  The Navy is                
              providing the civilian academic ocean science community with a                 
              unique, first-time opportunity to make scientific measurements                 
              under the ice in the Arctic Ocean from a nuclear powered submarine.            
              This cruise is scheduled for the late summer and is a prototype for            
              potential future submarine science cruises.  SSXCTDs are submarine-            
              launched counterparts to XCTDs that are deployed from research                 
              vessels.  These free-falling probes measure seawater temperature               
              and conductivity as a function of depth.  Use of SSXCTDs are                   
              crucial to the planned physical oceanography program on the                    
              submarine.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Making ocean science measurements, especially under the ice cap,               
              from an operational submarine has long been of interest to civilian            
              investigators.  This summer's cruise represents an opportunity to              
              test the feasibility of using operational submarines for basic                 
              scientific research.
