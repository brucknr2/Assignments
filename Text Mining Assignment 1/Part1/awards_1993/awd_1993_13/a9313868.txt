Abstract    :
                9313868  Landolt  This grant will support the continuation of a long term
              program to  establish standard stars for broad band photometry.  These stars 
              are needed for the calibration of stellar photometry and are used  by many
              investigators.  During the duration of the present grant  the standard star
              sequences will be extended to fainter stars and  as many stars with extreme
              colors will be included as possible.   ***
