Abstract    :
              9313818  Cooper    The central objective of the proposed work is to develop 
              quantitative models of the scattering and charge transfer dynamics  in
              hyperthermal ion-surface collisions.  The proposed work is  focussed on the
              scattering of alkali ions from copper surfaces as  model systems to study these
              dynamics.  Both the energy and angular  distributions of scattered positive
              ions and neutrals are measured.   Trajectory simulations will be used to test
              scattering models and  potentials, and determine energy transfer and trapping
              mechanisms.   Energy spectra peak widths will be used to study surface atom 
              binding forces.  Additional techniques, including Auger Electron  Spectroscopy,
              will be used to study trends in the trapping  probabilities as a function of
              ion and surface species, energy, and  geometry.  New simulation capabilities
              will be developed to  determine trapping mechanisms.  Comparisons of scattered
              neutral  and ion fluxes will be used to determine neutralization  probabilities
              and investigate the role of charge transfer in the  collision and trapping
              dynamics.  New experimental and simulation  capabilities are proposed to enable
              the study of the collision,  charge transfer and trapping dynamics of reactive
              ion-surface  collisions.  Trapping trends and overlayer deposition will be 
              studied with Auger and scanning tunneling microscopy.  The  information
              obtained from these studies will be useful for modeling  the interactions that
              occur in surface processing and thin film  deposition.  Such information could
              also be used to optimize these  techniques.  ***
