              will partially support travel costs of some participants in the minitrack for
              Data and Knowledge Base Issues in Genomics, which is part of the Hawaii
              International Conference on System Sciences/Biotechnology Computing Track.  The
              conference takes place in Maui, Hawaii, January 4   7, 1994.  The minitrack is
              a one day workshop consisting of paper presentations and discussion sessions
              that will bring together biologists and computer scientists interested in
              genome data management and retrieval.  Topics to be considered by this workshop
              include design and use of databases for genomic mapping and sequences,
              interchange and interoperability between genome databases, and integrating
              genome databases with knowledge bases.  This award is made in conjunction
              comparable support from the National Center for Human Genome Research and from
              the Department of Energy. ***
