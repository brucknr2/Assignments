Abstract    :
              9313546  Hayes  This award will allow the University of Indiana to modernize 
              its laboratory space that was originally built to  accommodate classical rock
              analysis in 1962 and now must be  adapted for research in isotopic
              biogeochemistry.  New hoods  and lob benches will be installed, a computer and
              data  facility will be established, and a core-storage and layout  room
              provided with this renovation project.  The  biogeochemistry labs at the
              University of Indiana are used  by four senior faculty and serve as an
              important training  center for individuals establishing biogeochemistry
              research  groups at other university locations.  Through geoscience  research,
              the focus of this lab is on the cycling of carbon  in modern and ancient
              environments.  To provide a basis for  interpretation of ancient records,
              members of this research  lab study structured fractionation of stable isotopes
              in  modern environments and microbial cultures, the  stabilization of
              sedimentary chemical systems in  contemporary settings, and the distribution
              and abundance's  of molecular structures in modern organisms.  The origin and 
              development of fossil fuels, the geochemistry of sedimentary  carbon, and the
              development of instrumentation and  techniques for both the analysis of stable
              isotopes in  traces of organic material and organic molecules are  additional
              research themes.  The modernization of this  laboratory is very important for
              the training of the next  generation of biogeochemists, low-temperature
              geochemists,  and geochemically-oriented geobiologists and  sedimentologists
              who will give us new knowledge about global  change issues.  ***
