Abstract    :
              Wartell         This award will help support the renovation of the high  bay
              area in the  Cherry Emerson Building at Georgia Institute of Technology.  This
              three story  building is home to the educational and research missions of the
              School of Biology  and to the instrumentation and staff of the Research Center
              for Biotechnology.  This  renovation will convert the high bay area into two
              floors of needed research  laboratories needed for the biosciences at this
              institution.  The research and training to  take place in these lab spaces
              include environmental biology, microbiology, and  molecular biology/genetics. 
              Technical expertise and training are available in this  building in the areas
              of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high resolution  mass spectroscopy,
              chromatographic separations, medium scale fermentation, and  microbial
              bioreactor systems.  This renovation project will provide approximately  3506
              square feet of modernized laboratory space to be used by 14 faculty, 7 
              postdoctoral fellows, 35 graduate students, 4 research technicians, and about
              32  undergraduate students.
