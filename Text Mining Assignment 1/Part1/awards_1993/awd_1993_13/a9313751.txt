Abstract    :
              9313751  Newman  Partial nucleotide sequence information will be obtained for 
              approximately 36,000 randomly selected anonymous cDNA clones from  Arabidopsis.
               The clones will be from a normalized library  constructed from mRNA
              representing leaves, roots, etiolated  seedlings and shoots (stems, flowers and
              developing seeds).   Approximately 450 base pairs will be obtained from the 5'
              end of  each cDNA clone by automated sequencing.  It is estimated that  this
              will provide partial sequence information for 85% of the  genes in Arabidopsis.
               The sequence information will be deposited  on a regular basis in a public
              access computer database.  ***
