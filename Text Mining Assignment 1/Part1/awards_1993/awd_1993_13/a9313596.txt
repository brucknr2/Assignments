Abstract    :
              9313596  Frey    This three-year award supports U.S.-Belgium cooperative
              research  between Frederick A. Frey of Massachusetts Institute of  Technology
              and Dominique Weis of the Universite Libre de  Bruxelles. Both groups will
              perform complementary geochemical  analyses of lavas erupted from the Kerguelen
              volcanic plume over  the last 40 million years. The resulting Kerguelen
              Archipelago is  considered a mantle "hotspot."  The award provides travel
              support  to Dr. Frey's graduate student for analysis and interpretation of  the
              complementary data sets.  The graduate student will benefit  from the expertise
              of U.S. and Belgium mentors and have access to  specialized equipment.  Dr.
              Frey brings to this collaboration  expertise for trace element analysis using
              neutron activation.   This is complemented by Dr. Weis' expertise in isotopic
              analysis  using mass spectrometry.    Studies of lavas and volcanism over a
              period of time have been  very useful in understanding mantle hotspots. Frey
              and Weis  propose to apply this approach to the Kerguelen Archipelago's  lavas.
              Their study will advance our understanding of mantle  hotspots and more
              specifically, of the Kerguelen hotspot's  influence in creating the eastern
              Indian Ocean seafloor.  ***
