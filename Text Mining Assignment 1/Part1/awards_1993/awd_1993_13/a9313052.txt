Abstract    :
              9313052  Ellis  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which is
              to devise mathematical  models with stochastic, multiobjective and  visual
              attributes that are capable of being  used to address environmental problems
              more  complex and on a scale larger than is now  possible.  The investigator
              plans on  developing parallel developing parallel  approaches to devise models
              that address more  than a single objective simultaneously and  that incorporate
              into the models  stochasticity and interactive visual  interfaces.  He plans on
              applying the models  developed to deal with environmental problems  such as the
              design of air pollution  monitoring networks that consider intermedia  transfer
              of pollutants from air to water and  to determine the way in which this
              approach  could be used in management of groundwater  quality.    Results of
              this research are expected to  include its application in engineering design 
              of systems for abatement of air and water  pollution and in evaluating the
              ecological  consequences that result from emissions  trading concepts, a
              current attribute of  approaches for dealing with abatement of air  pollution
              and which is being considered for  water as well.  Results of this project are 
              expected to be utilized in design of  approaches to dealing with environmental 
              problems on a scale that is more consistent  with scope of the problems than is
              now  possible to address with existing  environmental models.
