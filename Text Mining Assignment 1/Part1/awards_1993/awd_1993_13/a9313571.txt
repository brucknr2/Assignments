Abstract    :
              The concurrent volcanic activities of Mt. Mayon and Mt.                        
              Pinatubo in the island of Luzon, Philippines, offer a rare                     
              opportunity to compare and contrast the petrology and mantle                   
              source signature of the East and West Philippine volcanic                      
              arcs.  Mt. Mayon belongs to the East Arc wherein volcanism                     
              is associated with the subduction underneath Luzon of the                      
              Philippine Sea Plate with thin pelagic sediment cover                          
              whereas Mt. Pinatubo belongs to the West Arc wherein                           
              volcanism is the result of the eastward subduction of the                      
              South China  Sea Plate with moderate terrigenous sediment                      
              cover.  We propose a combined field and laboratory                             
              investigation of volcanic rocks from Mt. Pinatubo and Mt.                      
              Mayon.  In the field, we will map and try to collect                           
              representative samples from the oldest to the youngest                         
              eruptive products of both volcanoes.  In the lab, samples                      
              collected  will be analyzed for their petrography,                             
              mineralogy, bulk major and trace element chemistry, and Sr,                    
              Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions.  The proposed                                
              investigation is a collaborative effort among workers from                     
              the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, United State                          
              Geological Survey and Philippine Institute of Volcanology                      
              and Seismology.
