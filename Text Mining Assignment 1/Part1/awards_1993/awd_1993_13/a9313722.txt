Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the
              Chemistry Division, Paul Dagdigian will study the   gas-phase dynamics of atoms
              and small molecular free radicals   in molecular beams.  Laser-induced
              fluorescence will be used to  determine the internal product state
              distributions.  Both   atom-radical and radical-radical reactions will be
              studied.  In   a new direction for his research program, Dagdigian will  
              examine the reaction of oxygen and chlorine atoms with   vibrationally excited
              methane isotopomers using stimulated   Raman excitation to prepare the
              molecular reagents.  The   reactions of excited Al atoms with H2 will be
              investigated   using emission and laser-induced fluorescence detection.    In
              this project Dagdigian will study the effect on the rate or   pathway of a
              chemical reaction of energizing one of the   reacting partners with a specific
              type of excitation.  Atoms   with a large amount of excitation will be reacted
              with certain   molecules, or other larger molecules with lesser amounts of  
              excitation will be reacted with atoms.  Such studies will   permit an
              understanding of the effect on reactions of exciting   these different modes in
              the reacting atoms and molecules.    These are very fundamental studies which
              could impact practical   areas such as semiconductor or materials
              manufacturing.
