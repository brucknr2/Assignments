Abstract    :
              9313946  Balakrishnan  Artificial neural network based  controllers for
              nonlinear systems  will be studied int he project.   Two main objectives of
              this project  are to formulate neural network  controllers based on adaptive 
              critic designs and stochastic  representations of uncertain  nonlinear systems.
               Hamiltonian and  its derivatives which occur in the  formulation of optimal
              control  problems are proposed in the  adaptive critic design.  A constant 
              network configuration controller  and an online-modified network  configuration
              controllers are  proposed based on neighboring  optimal control theory.  The 
              stochastic representations of a  plant are proposed to be based on  filtering
              theory.  Furthermore,  classes of problems are described  on which these
              network controllers  are proposed to be investigated.   It is hoped that the
              results of  this study will substantially  improve understanding of the 
              adaptive critic based neuro  controllers and the stochastic  neural network
              representations of  uncertain nonlinear systems.  ***
