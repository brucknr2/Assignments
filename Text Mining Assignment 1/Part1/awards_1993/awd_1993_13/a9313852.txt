Abstract    :
              Proposal No:  9312852    This project will develop a new measurement technology
              for low-frequency NMR and NQR measurements in which a SQUID detector functions
              as a high-sensitivity broadband detection system for stochastic NMR
              measurements.  The inherent sensitivity of a SQUID sensor and its wide
              bandwidth make it the ideal detection device for low-frequency magnetic
              resonance experiments.  The bandwidth of the SQUID system also offers a unique
              match to the broadband nature of the rf excitation used in stochastic NMR.  In
              addition, experiments at the University of California, Berkeley and Phase I
              measurements have shown that SQUID systems can be used in low-frequency pulsed
              experiments.  The combination of both wideband and pulsed measurement
              capabilities in a single instrument offers the promise of a unique and powerful
              new tool in NMR and NQR studies of modern materials.  Potential applications
              for this measurement technology include NQR and zero-field NMR studies of
              amorphous and polycrystalline solids, NQR measurements of deuterium for studies
              of solid organic compounds and polymers, and the investigation of a wide
              variety of biologically-significant molecules through NQR measurements on 14
              {superscript}N.  By providing highly resolved spectra in polycrystalline and
              other disordered systems, it is likely that such a system will become a
              research tool in a variety of scientific disciplines.
