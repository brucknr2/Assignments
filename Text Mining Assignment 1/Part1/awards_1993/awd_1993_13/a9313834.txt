Abstract    :
              9313834 Wiens          The project seeks to use force and position data from
              avaliable automated deburring devices for burr recognition, and prediction of
              chamfering depth, tool wear, part alignment, and kinematic and dynamically
              induced errors.  The feasibility of establishing such corrleations for various
              micromanipulators available for automated deburring will also be investigated. 
              The dependence of such corrlwations on the micromanipulator design will also be
              determined.          The results from the work will provide thenecessary
              correlation models needed for developing a smart deburring system that is
              capable of adaptively responding in real time to process and part variations
              with on line tuning and path planning.  The approach should remove or minimize
              the need for vision feedback, making the system less sensitive to problems such
              as occlusions and need for prior data processing.  Areas that will benefit from
              the research are finishing of machined surfaces and sand cast surfaces.
