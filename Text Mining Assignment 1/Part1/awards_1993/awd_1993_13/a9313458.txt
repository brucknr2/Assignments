               The Tufts Chemistry Department has undergone a rejuvenation in all aspects of
              its program during the last decade.  The research program has abandoned the
              traditional areas of analytical, inorganic, organic and physical chemistry to
              pursue the field of materials, environmental, and biomedical chemistry.  These
              focus areas are strengths not only of the department, but of the university as
              well.  A resurgence in research and funding activities, and the recruitment of
              new faculty, has made it necessary to renovate and upgrade the department's two
              research and training buildings, Pearson and Michael laboratories, constructed
              in 1923 and 1968 respectively.  Although adequate space exits within the
              Pearson-Michael complex to meet the needs of anticipated faculty and students,
              the space is presently underutilized due to antiquated conditions.  Original
              laboratories are unusable because they are contain asbestos, have inadequate
              electrical and plumbing systems, and no operable fume hoods.  ARI funds have
              been requested to renovate laboratory space and the general infrastructure,
              specifically, the electrical and plumbing systems, HVAC and fire safety
              systems.  These renovations will allow faculty to consolidate their research
              activities that are currently dispersed over several locations in the two
              buildings.  Modernization of the facilities will provide a safe, well equipped
              environment for faculty and student to conduct research.
