Abstract    :
              Medical ultrasound works by illuminating the body's interior with short, high
              frequency sound pulses, receiving the echoes, processing them numerically, and
              displaying the moving image in real-time on a CTR screen.  The heart of
              ultrasound is a rather sophisticated composite transducer.  With this
              sophistication, conventional design methods are approaching practical limits of
              effectiveness.  Comprehensive computer modeling is seen as the answer.  The
              industry is currently using frequency-domain finite element codes exclusively,
              with limited success due in part to the transient character of the signals
              modeled.  A much better alternative is explicit time-domain simulation.  In our
              Phase I project we developed and validated such a time-domain finite element
              code, FLEX, for transient analysis of piezoelectric transducers and general
              wave propagation.  It includes complete and operational piezoelectric,
              acoustic, and elastic elements.  the Proposed Phase II project will extend and
              tailor the code to the very special needs of practicing design engineers.  This
              research and development is essential if we are to achieve the technical and
              marketing potential of this computer modeling system during the present window
              of opportunity.  We are working with ultrasound companies in order to guide
              these usage enhancements.
