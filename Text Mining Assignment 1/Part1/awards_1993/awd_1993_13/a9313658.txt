              _________________________________________________________________    This
              dissertation research proposal to study language use in a bilingual community
              on Easter Island, Chile, received enthusiastic reviews.    The student is in
              Chile now, doing research.  She will return to the US and then begin her
              research in the early spring.  She has access to the research site, and has no
              other support for this project.  I questioned the need for two expensive tape
              recorders, but the adviser convinced me of the student's need for two of the
              less expensive recorders as well as two transcriber machines.  The student will
              hire people to do the transcription work, and will use a machine herself.   
              Linguistics will co-fund this award.    I recommend that this proposal be
              funded     DAMmmm d, yyyy    PG   9313658    Errington     This project
              involves the dissertation research of a linguistic anthropology student from
              Yale university, investigating the use of language as a mediator of social
              relations during rapid social change in a bilingual community of Easter Island,
              Chile.  The speech community is changing gradually from a native Polynesian
              language to Spanish, and some recently have asserted a native cultural identity
              to claim improved social and economic rights.  This has raised awareness of the
              value of language as a symbol of group identity and as a tool of resistance
              against Chile's control.  Using tape recorded conversations, interviews, and
              participant observation, the student will analyze bilingual language use and
              patterns of language change as expressions of and instruments for shaping
              ethnic, national and gender identities.   This research is important because
              local cultural identity struggles against dominant state institutions are a
              fact of life in most of the world.  Improved understanding of the process of
              local cultural identity formation and the role of language use in this process
              can help decision makers plan for cooperative local-st ate relations.  ***
