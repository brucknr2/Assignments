Abstract    :
                 9313915      Herbert   In this collaborative, interdisciplinary study, PIs
              will   investigate biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy  and
              stable isotope stratigraphy of a middle Cretaceous marine   sequence in
              northeastern Mexico, representing a time of rapid   global change.  Issues to
              be addressed include:  1) presence of   correlative oceanic anoxic events, 2)
              appropriateness of an oxygen-  minimum-zone model for this sequence, 3)
              potential correlation of  organic-rich sedimentation with sea-level
              fluctuations, 4)   relationship of organic-carbon burial events to record of
              carbon  isotopes, 5) significance of a brief magnetic reversal during this 
              time, 6) are orbital periodicities recorded in this sequence?, 7)  how does the
              expression of cyclicity change along the basin   margin?, 8) timing of
              evolution of planktonic forams during this  time, and 9) how do nannoplankton
              and planktonic forams respond to  events around this time period?  Potential
              drilling sites for   Apticore/Albicore will be evaluated.   ***
