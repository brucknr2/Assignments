Abstract    :
              9313993  Knoblock    An important and difficult problem in Knowledge Management
              is how  to efficiently retrieve information from distributed, heterogeneous 
              multidatabase systems.  This project addresses this problem by  bringing to
              bear a richer set of knowledge about databases to  optimize multidatabases
              queries.  The idea is to use semantic  knowledge of the contents of databases
              to reformulate queries into  equivalent yet less expensive ones.  Using this
              knowledge, the  potential cost reduction is significantly more than can be
              derived  from convention query optimization alone.  Since the semantic 
              knowledge required can be learned from any database, this approach  is
              applicable to other Knowledge-intensive systems.  ***
