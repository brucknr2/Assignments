Abstract    :
              9314555  COULL  This research project will center on determining if meiofauna
              are  as fully integrated into sub-tropical estuarine detritus-based food  webs
              as they are in similar temperate region food webs. This  research project will
              be carried out in cooperation with Australian  colleagues who have a long-term
              data record on the species  composition and abundance of demersal/natant fauna
              in the mangrove  dominated Pumicestone Passage, Moreton Bay, which is located
              on the  central east coast of Australia. The project will first determine  what
              species of juvenile fish utilize meiofauna as a numerically  abundant diet
              item. Subsequently, the meiofaunal species  composition in the habitats where
              the fish live will be determined.  This data is essential to determine if the
              prey fauna in the guts  have been eaten where the fish live and, if gut
              contents are  consistent with the resident prey available. After these two 
              descriptive phases of the research are completed experiments are  planned to
              test meiofaunal removal rates by a dominant juvenile  fish predator and whether
              certain meiofauna are being selected by  bottom-feeding juvenile fish.  These
              experiments will be conducted  in microcosms in a recirculating sea-water
              system and will follow  the protocol used in similar experiments performed
              previously in  the PI's laboratory in South Carolina.  ***
