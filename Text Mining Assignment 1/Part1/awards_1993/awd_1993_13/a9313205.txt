Abstract    :
              9313205  Stampf       This award provides funds for continued operation of the
              Protein Data Bank  PDB  at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The PDB database
              contains atomic coordinates for proteins, nucleic acids and macromolecular
              assemblies, such as viruses, whose 3 dimensional structures have been
              determined through x-ray crystallographic or nuclear magnetic resonance  NMR 
              techniques.  The database currently contains in excess of 2000 entries, and is
              expected to double in size in the next 3 years.  The PDB may be accessed
              directly through electronic mail; copies of the database are also available at
              a nominal charge from the PDB and from a number of secondary sources.  This
              database is used by structural biologists in academic institutions, government
              and private research organizations, and industrial research laboratories.  ***
