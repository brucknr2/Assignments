Abstract    :
              9313422  Beitz  This award will provide funding for the renovation of research
              and research training space in  the Cleaveland Chemistry Building on the campus
              of Bowdoin College.  The institution has a  long tradition in  graduating
              students in the natural sciences, although they work toward  those degrees in
              antiquated science facilities.  Constructed in 1952,  present conditions within
               Cleaveland Hall are inadequate to support research activities in chemistry. 
              Laboratories lack   proper ventilation, plumbing and electrical systems,
              preventing researchers from getting full  use of sophisticated equipment. 
              Renovations will consist of upgrading the existing research  space by 
              improving the electrical, mechanical and ventilation systems, as well as
              replacing  casework, lighting, and fume hood.  Several laboratories will be
              reconfigured to make more  efficient use of space and to provide increased
              access for disabled persons.  A renovated  building will provide increased
              access to science for all who use the facility, and enhance the  research
              experiences gained by students.  The renovation project will not only help the 
              college attract and retain students, but it will assist Bowdoin in laying the
              foundation for  continued excellence in research and research training in
              chemistry for the future.
