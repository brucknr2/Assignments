Abstract    :
              9313280  Gabrielse    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Gerald Gabrielse, 
              Department of Physics, Harvard University, to pursue with Dr.  Wonho Jhe,
              Department of Physics, Seoul National University,  Korea, for 36 months, a
              program of cooperative research on  antiproton studies and mass spectroscopy. 
              In this research,  antiprotons produced in LEAR, the high energy accelerator at
               CERN, Geneva Switzerland, are trapped and stored in thermal  equilibrium at
              4.2  K.  Subsequently, the inertial masses,  magnetic moments, and other
              properties of antiprotons and protons  may be compared.    The collaborators
              are highly respected researchers in the field  of the proposal.  In addition,
              Dr. Jhe has available to his  research group, in Korea, facilities for
              producing negative  hydrogen ions which can be loaded into the antiproton trap
              and  used in comparisons of antiproton and proton properties.  The use  of
              negative hydrogen ions rather than protons in these  experiments will greatly
              reduce a number of large experimental  errors.  This project is relevant to the
              objectives of the U.S.-  Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to
              increase the  level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and 
              engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,  skills, and
              techniques and through collaboration on problems of  mutual benefit.  Korean
              participation in the project is supported  by the Korea Science and Engineering
              Foundation (KOSEF).  This  project adds an international cooperative dimension
              to the PI's  research under NSF Grant No. PHY-9122373.    ***
