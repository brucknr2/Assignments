Abstract    :
              9313860  Weiner   The research supported here involves the dynamics of an
              ultra-cold ensemble of colliding atoms.  At low enough temperatures (or
              relative kinetic energies), many new effects become dominant.  The quantum
              mechanical wavelength becomes greater than the range of the chemical forces,
              and spontaneous emission lifetimes become short compared to collision times.  A
              theoretical and experimental program will be continued to study the behavior of
              inelastic and bond-forming collision processes in magneto-optical traps and in
              atomic beams.  ***   u    wq=  u    w , u    , u     v  v  v  v  v  v  v
