Abstract    :
              9313526  Buchsbaum       This award allows the University of Pennsylvania to 
              renovate and modernize research space in order to enhance  it's
              Neuroengineering Research Laboratories.  By modernizing  these facilities, this
              university will be able to integrate  research and training in engineering
              technology with the  study of brain function.  While emphasizing vision, the 
              integration of psychology, physiology, computer science and  engineering
              technology can lead to tremendous advances in  research in such areas as
              machine vision at this  institution.  The research is lead by 15 highly
              regarded  faculty, while 4 postdoctoral fellows, 43 graduate students  and 42
              undergraduate students will take advantage of the  renovated facility.    The
              University of Pennsylvania has a  unique environment for this activity since it
              has an NSF  Science and Technology Center in Cognitive Science along  with the
              department of neuroengineering and an Institute in  Neurological Sciences.  The
              Neuroengineering Research  Laboratories will provide a central facility for 
              collaborative research, and will offer the capability for  advanced training in
              state-of-the-art simulation methods in  neural networks.  Finally, this
              department interacts with  Lincoln University (an HBCU) in order to include
              more  minority participation in the engineering activities at the  University
              of Pennsylvania.  ***
