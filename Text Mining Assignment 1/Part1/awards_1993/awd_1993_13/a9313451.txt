Abstract    :
              Cassidy         During the past few years, research and research training
              activities have  increased markedly in the Biology and Chemistry Departments at
              Southwest Texas  State University. This growth has been hampered by several
              deficiencies in the  laboratory facilities available to faculty and students:
              inadequate electrical power,  limited gas lines, antiquated plumbing, and a
              lack of appropriate fume hoods and  ventilation. The university plans to
              renovate 8,200 square feet of laboratory space that  will provide a suitable
              environment for research and research training in polymer and  organometallic
              synthesis, environmental and industrial science, molecular biosciences,  and a
              fish genetic stock center.       This renovation will enhance the research and
              research training activity at  Southwest Texas State University in several
              significant ways. Faculty research  projects will have appropriate environments
              for new state-of-the-art instrumentation.  Collaborative student-faculty
              research projects will have adequate and appropriate  laboratory space.
              Specialized functions such as the fish genetic stock center will have 
              dedicated facilities with the necessary environmental quality and controls. New
              faculty  will be attracted to the university owing to the availability of
              high-quality research  facilities, and students will be drawn toward careers in
              the sciences.  ***
