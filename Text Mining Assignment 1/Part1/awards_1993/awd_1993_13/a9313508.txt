Abstract    :
              Chapman         This award will allow the University of California at  Los
              Angeles to renovate and modernize approximately 14,000  square feet of lab
              space  into a computer modeling research  facility in the chemical and
              biological sciences.  The  existing space does not conform to current fire,
              life  safety, code, and access requirements.  The renovation of  the fourth
              floor of the south wing of Young Hall will make  available a Chem-Bio Research
              Visualization and Learning  Center dedicated to high-resolution computer
              graphic display  instruction and research, as well as support spaces.  This 
              facility will be used by researchers, students, both  undergraduate and
              graduates, and postdoctoral fellows.  The  vision for this center  has been
              responsible for creating an  environment that will foster interaction among
              various  groups for innovative computer utilization.  Novel methods  are also
              employed by the new center arrangement to provide  means of enhancing the
              chances of minority and women in the  life sciences.  This project will be
              cost-shared with the  State of California and is an integral part of their
              science  challenge designed to attract and retain students in science  and to
              improve the attitudes of students towards science.  ***
