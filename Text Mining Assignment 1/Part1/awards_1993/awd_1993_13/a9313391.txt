Abstract    :
              This award will provide funding for the renovation of the specimen preparation
              and optical  analysis laboratory facilities at the Oregon Graduate Institute of
              Science and Technology.   The renovation project is part of a large program to
              renovate and modernize Materials  Science and Engineering research and
              educational facilities on campus.  Constructed in 1968,  the facilities are
              used for research projects in the first stages of microstructural and 
              microchemical analysis. Research and training activities, conducted in these
              facilities, are  fundamental to Materials Science and Engineering.  The
              specimen preparation laboratories  are a resource for other department and for
              users outside the Institute, enabling technology  for interdisciplinary
              activities.  The entire renovation project will establish at the Institute an 
              integrated microscopy laboratory complex combining optical and electron
              microscopy  facilities, and all related sample preparation and image processing
              activities.    The renovation will address the following conditions: 
              ineffective space utilization, health and  safety violations or potential
              hazardous, and quality limitations which impact equipment or  reduce
              performance.  Existing interior walls and infrastructure, utilities, and fixed
              equipment  will be replaced and reconfigurated to provide efficient laboratory
              space.  New fume hood  will be installed, improving the chemical handling and
              storage capabilities necessary to meet  OSHA requirements.  The success of this
              project will allow the institution to meet research  and educational goals and
              attract researchers and students by creating an environment where  they can
              work and learn effectively.
