Abstract    :
                Metcalf  This proposal is for continuation of research in laser cooling  and
              trapping with extension to the use of Stark spectra to  provide a link between
              laboratory electric fields and atomic  constants.  The laser cooling work
              attempts to provide a unified  picture of the various cooling mechanism based
              on Raman  resonances.  The picture would be applicable in the limit where 
              atomic motion is no longer classical but must be described  quantum
              mechanically.  Monte-Carlo wave function simulations are  being developed to
              arrive at a complete quantum theory of laser  cooling whose physical picture is
              intuitively satisfying.  A  second major area of research is directed to
              providing a direct  high-accuracy link between laboratory electric fields and
              atomic  constants using interference narrowing of Stark spectra.  ***
