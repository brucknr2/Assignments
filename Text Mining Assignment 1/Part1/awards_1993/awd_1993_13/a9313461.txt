Abstract    :
              9313461  Wylie   Materials research, in the context of Civil Engineering
              applications, is an essential   subset of any modern, successful engineering
              program.  The basic public works   infrastructure in the United States is in
              need of massive upgrading.  An important   ingredient in the ultimate
              improvement of these facilities nationwide is the development,   introduction,
              and implementation of new materials into the design and construction  
              industry.  The program at the University of Michigan is attempting to play a
              major role in   this process.  This award will make it possible for this
              institution to more efficiently utilize   their current (4000 square feet)
              laboratory space in materials research through renovation   of the facilities. 
              Through massively reorganizing and upgrading these facilities, the   materials
              research and graduate training will be made more effective.  The facilities  
              renovations will focus on the functions of processing, mechanical testing, and 
               microstructural analysis in separate areas.  This will enable researchers to
              operate   independently and be productive in different functional activities,
              something that is   impossible in the current laboratory environment.  ***
