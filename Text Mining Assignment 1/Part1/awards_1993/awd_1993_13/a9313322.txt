Abstract    :
              9313322  Das       This project outlines the development of a design for quality
               manufacturability (DFQM) method, to be used in the assessment of  assembled
              products.  This method complements other methodologies  which assess handling,
              and processing manufacturability.  The basis  for DFQM is a set of common
              classes of quality defects, and a set  of factors which influence the
              occurrence of these defects.  A  series of functional equations which derive
              the likelihood of a  defect occurring, on the basis of design data, are
              developed.       The quality manufacturability of a design is defined as the 
              likelihood that defects will occur during its manufacture in a  standard plant.
               This project addresses the eminent need for a  methodology that enables
              product designers to evaluate the quality  manufacturability of a design.  The
              availability of such a method  not only improves the quality yield of a plant,
              but also permits a  shortening of the product realization process.  Both
              features are  critical in improving competitiveness.
