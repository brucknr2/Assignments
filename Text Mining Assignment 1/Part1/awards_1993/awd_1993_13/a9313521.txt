Abstract    :
              9313521  Bolla        The Biology Department of St. Louis University has an
              active and  growing group of faculty in the area of botanical research. In the
              last three  years, their research and research training efforts have expanded
              to the point  that their outdated facilities are no longer able to provide
              suitable space. This is  especially true for faculty-supervised student
              research projects. Undergraduates  hoping to work on independent research
              projects are now routinely turned  away for lack of suitable lab space.       
              To resolve this problem, St. Louis University has planned to renovate a 
              moribund research lab into a shared-use lab for students and faculty, and to 
              replace a research greenhouse whose environmental controls cannot be  repaired.
              The research lab will receive new casework, an autoclave, plumbing,  laminar
              flow and fume hoods, as well as new space partitioning. The new  greenhouse
              will have modern environmental controls that will support a wide  range of
              experiments. These facilities modernization projects will alleviate the  space
              shortage by creating highly suitable environments for research in plant  growth
              and physiology, biochemistry, and plant pathology. The renovations will  enable
              student and faculty research collaborations, and will help to attract  students
              to careers in science.  ***
