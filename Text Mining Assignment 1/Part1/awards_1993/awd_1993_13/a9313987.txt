              dissertation research proposal to study how rural Indonesians use concepts of
              personhood and individual vulnerability to manage their health situations
              received enthusiastic reviews. The student has delayed her planned fieldwork,
              and requests support beginning March 1994.  She has affirmed that her research
              visa is in process, and has provided additional justification for her request
              for a video recorder.  Recorded conversations can be used to elicit subtle
              codes and understandings in later interviews.    She has a small amount of
              other funding, which does not duplicate this award.    I recommend that this
              proposal be funded     DAMmmm d, yyyy    PG   9313987  Barth     This project
              involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropology student from
              Emory University, studying how people in a rural Indonesian hamlet understand
              health and illness.  Using ethnographic methods of in-depth interviews and
              participant-observation, the student will study how people discuss and analyze
              illness episodes in themselves and others.  She will focus on the metaphors
              people use, in order to understand their underlying cultural models of
              vulnerability to illness and misfortune.  This area of Indonesia is well known
              for black magic, and people are especially conscious of the potential for
              misfortune.  The student will videotape extensive discussions of a small number
              of illness cases, in order to analyze the knowledge people bring to bear.   
              This project is important because this case study, in a region of the world
              where people have heightened concern about personal misfortune, will give
              in-depth information which can be compared with people's models of health and
              illness from other cultures.  At a time when health care is so much in our
              national attention, such comparative information will give valuable
              cross-cultural perspectives on our own health syst em.  It is also important
              because because it will increase our expertise about this fast-growing area of
              the world.  People everywhere must confront their personal vulnerability to
              illness, and the sort of comparative case-study information this project will
              generate will help us understand general human coping processes.     ***  LBRV
