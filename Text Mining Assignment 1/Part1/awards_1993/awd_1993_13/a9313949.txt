Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Profs. Christophorou and Pinnaduwage of the Physics Department   of the
              University of Tennessee will investigate the electron attachment   to
              electronically excited molecules.  Included in the studies are:   comprehensive
              2-color electron attachment experiments on highly-excited   states of molecular
              hydrogen and oxygen; photodetachment experiments to   confirm the production of
              negative hydrogen and oxygen atomic ions;   measurement of  electron attachment
              to long-lived, low-lying   electronically-excited states of nitrogen dioxide
              and sulfur dioxide; and   measuerment of electron attachment to
              electronically-excited   photofragments produced via laser irradiation of
              carbon dioxide.       In contrast to extensive, previous electron attachment
              studies on    molecules in their electronic ground state, only very few studies
              have   been performed on electronically excited molecules owing to the great  
              experimental difficulties encountered.  New techniques have recently been  
              developed by the principal investigator to make such investigations   easier to
              do. The present work will exploit these advances through a   systematic study
              with simple molecules in order to obtain a better   understanding of the basic
              electron attachment process in molecules in   low-lying  as well those in
              high-lying  electronically excited states.
