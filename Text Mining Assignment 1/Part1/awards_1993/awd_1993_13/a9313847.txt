Abstract    :
                9313847  Stolfo  We study solutions to the performance bottleneck in expert 
              databases using the PARADISER  10  distributed rule processing  environment as
              our testbed.  We purpose an approach that combines  statically computed
              restrictions on the rules of a rule program for  partitioning the workload of
              rule evaluation among an arbitrary  number of rule program replicas evaluated
              at distinct processing  sites, and dynamic load balancing protocols that update
              and  reorganize the distribution of workload by modifying the  restrictions at
              runtime.  (Rules are not redistributed.)  Our  techniques utilize one form of
              "meta-data", namely, statistics  gathered on the attribute values and size of
              relations of the  underlying database (e.g., number of distinct values of an 
              attribute, number of tuples in a relation etc.) in the algorithms  that compute
              the restrictions on the rules.  We analyze the dynamic  load balancing
              protocols in terms of efficiency and scalability  criteria, which provide
              guidance on the expected behavior of the  protocols with increasing database
              size.    The proposed research falls into three main categories:  (a)  workload
              distribution paradigms among processing sites to  ameliorate the performance
              degradation resulting from scaling up of  database size, (b) a suite of load
              balancing protocols for dynamic  "logical" reorganization of the underlying
              database, and their  scaling characteristics, and , (c) experimental validation
              in the  PARADISER expert database environment, using a suite of benchmark  rule
              programs.  A fully operational and transferable rule  processing environment
              will be constructed that embodies these  results.
