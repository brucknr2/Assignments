Abstract    :
              9313676  Stegeman    Connecting micro- and broad-scale physical factors to
              growth in  calanoid copepods and larval cod and haddock is essential to the 
              US-GLOBEC Georges Bank Program.  Prior methods to measure growth  have involved
              morphometrics, life stage durations, egg production,  and indirect biochemical
              methods, such as the RNA/DNA ratio.  Dr.  Stegeman will utilize
              immunohistochemical, histological and  fluorometric methods to detect cell
              proliferation, continuing the  application of this technique in marine fish and
              invertebrates.   The method uses monoclonal antibodies to molecular markers of
              cells  synthesizing nuclear DNA to allow quanitification of such cells.   An
              early aim will be to establish which cell and organ  proliferation rates most
              closely reflect overall growth rate, as  measured morphometrically in larval
              fish, and by stage length in  copepods.  The time scale over which such
              differences can be  measured will be studied in a series of laboratory
              experiments.   Subsequently, they will participate in the US-GLOBEC Process 
              cruises that are being planned, to develop and apply the method at  sea. 
              Participation in this study will translate physical  measurements of vertical
              mixing and stratification, that fluctuate  as a result of short and long term
              climatic changes, into an  instant assay for the biological effects of such
              parameters.  ***
