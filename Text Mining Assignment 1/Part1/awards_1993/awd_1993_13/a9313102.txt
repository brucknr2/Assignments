Abstract    :
              9313102  Turro  The photochemical behavior of supramolecular systems will be  
              studied, in particular guest-host complexes and   supermolecules. The guest
              systems include precursor ketones   which produce triplet geminate radical
              pairs and metal   complexes that serve as electron donor acceptor transfer  
              pairs. The host systems include colloidal micellar   aggregates, double helical
              DNA and porous molecular   crystalline zeolites. The supermolecules include
              biradicals   produced by photolysis of large ring cyclic ketones and  
              donor-acceptor complexes separated in space at fixed   distances by a DNA
              spacer. The objectives of the proposed   research include the discovery of new
              knowledge which will   allow the control of the chemistry of supramolecular
              systems   that involve highly reactive species such as biradicals and  
              micellized radical pairs, and the photoinduced electron   transfer processes
              between metal complexes.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program
              supports the   continuing work of Professor Nicholas J. Turro at Columbia  
              University. Supramolecular chemistry has been defined as the   chemistry beyond
              the molecule. Two important classes of   supramolecules will be studied:
              guest-host complexes and   supermolecules. Guest-host complexes consist of two
              or more   molecules that are held together by attractive forces,   rather than
              chemical bonds. The supermolecules to be studied   can be viewed as a
              consisting of two or more subunits,   connected by spacer units. The structure
              and dynamics of   these supramolecules as well as reactive intermediates that  
              will generated by photolysis will be studied. The results of   this study will
              find applications to technological   activities involving chemistry at
              interfaces, the   characterization of materials possessing unusual properties, 
               and to an understanding of the binding of small guest   molecules to
              biomolecules.  ***
