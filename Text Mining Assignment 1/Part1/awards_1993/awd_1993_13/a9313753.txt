Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of Oregon will                      
              support the research of Professor Michael Haley. The major                     
              focus of the research is the synthesis and characterization of                 
              extended carbon networks and molecules with a high C:H ratio.                  
              Based on MNDO calculations, a low energy phase of carbon                       
              consisting of stacked, planar carbon layers equally occupied by                
              sp2 and sp states should be stable. The synthesis of such                      
              structures will be carried out based on palladium-catalyzed                    
              cross coupling reactions of polyacetylenes. The extended carbon                
              networks will be characterized by x-ray and solid state NMR                    
              techniques.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              The properties of these novel carbon networks will be of great                 
              relevance in the search for organic conductors, electrochromic                 
              display materials, liquid crystals, synthetic ferromagnets and                 
              nonlinear optical materials.
