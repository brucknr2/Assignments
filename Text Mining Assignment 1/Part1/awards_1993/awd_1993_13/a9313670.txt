Abstract    :
              9313670 Brink          The GLOBEC NW Atlantic/Georges Bank observational program
              is planned to last for 4.5 years, beginning in 1994.  As part of this effort,
              Dr. Brink and colleagues will deploy three moorings throughout the period at
              the Bank center, on the northwestern end, and on the south flank.  All moorings
              would measure currents, temperature, conductivity, phytoplankton proxies
              (fluorescence and light transmission) and photosynthetically available
              radiation.  Most deployments will use acoustic Doppler current profilers which
              also allow estimates of zooplankton stocks.  The central mooring will be
              equipped with a complete suite of meteorological sensors. This project will
              also deploy Argos tracked drifters on each of the broad scale hydrographic
              cruises.  The drifters will provide quantitative estimates of water residence
              times and preferred exit sites from the Bank.          This measurement program
              will provide continuous records of the physical and biological status of waters
              over the Bank, and a context for all other measurements made during the GLOBEC
              Georges Bank study.  The data base will be used to understand the effects of
              advection and stratification on the plankton population over the Bank. ***
