Abstract    :
              Taft         This award supports the replacement of the Biological Laboratories 
              Greenhouse at Harvard University.  This replacement was deemed necessary
              because  the existing facility, built in 1931, was unsafe.  The new structure
              will allow students  the opportunity to carry out projects through the winter
              months, and will provide  more stable environmental control conducive to
              growing plants year-round.  The  research conducted in the new facility will
              include: molecular genetics of phylogeny;  growth patterns and whole organism
              development; gene control of cell-cell  communication during fertilization;
              breeding systems and hybridization; and  fundamental morphology.  Such
              fundamental studies enhance our understanding of  plant biology and thereby
              contribute to assessing the potential effects of global change  on terrestrial
              ecosystems, ecosystem responses to climate alteration, and the role of  plants
              in mitigating global climate change.  This renovation project will directly 
              impact 16 faculty, 13 graduate students, 6 postdoctoral fellows, and supplies
              the plant  materials for about 550 undergraduate students yearly.
