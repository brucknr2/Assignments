Abstract    :
              9313563  PERRY         This award is a renewal of an award to the National
              Academy  of Science to support the work of the National Research Council's 
              Board on Global Change (NRC/BGC).  Most of this award ($605,408)  provides
              funds to enable the NRC/BGC and other NRC committees and  boards to continue to
              provide assistance to agencies  participating with NSF in core functions of the
              FCCSET Committee  on Earth and Environmental Science's Subcommittee on Global 
              Change Research (CEES/SGCR) in the development and evaluation of  the U.S.
              Global Change Research Program (US/GCRP).  Through this  additional funding,
              which was contributed by agencies  participating as members in the CEES/SGCR,
              the NRC/BGC and  related NRC boards and committees will continue to fulfill
              their  responsibilities in the following areas:       1.  Provision of advice
              to the CEES/SGCR on the U.S. Global  Change Research Program (US/GCRP);      
              2.  Provision of periodic reviews of the US/GCRP;       3.  Service as a
              liaison between the U.S. and other nations  in international planning efforts;
              and       4.  Establishment and operation of special ad hoc groups to  address
              issues of special concern regarding the US/GCRP.         In addition to
              continuing these core activities, an  additional $121,532 is made available to
              NAS through interagency  transfer of funds from NOAA to support two related
              activities:       1.  NRC Ocean Studies Board efforts to supplement the work 
              of the NRC/BGC, particularly as it relates to the role of the  ocean in global
              change research (an activity to be funded at a  level of $50,000); and       2.
               Support for the GOALS meeting conducted under the  auspices of the NRC Board
              on Atmospheric Science and Climate (an  activity to be funded at a level of
              $71,532).  ***
