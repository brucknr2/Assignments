Abstract    :
              9313449  Halperin  The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern 
              University has exceedingly strong basic research programs  and wishes to place
              them into advanced research environments  by renovating their laboratories. 
              This award allows  Northwestern to modernize 11,300 square feet of research 
              space in order to provide  a state-of-the-art environment  for advanced
              research in experimental condensed-matter  physics and the design and
              construction of advanced  detectors for use in condensed-matter physics and 
              astrophysics.  This modernization will take place in the  Technological
              Building that has not been renovated in 50  years.  The renovated laboratories
              will include clean-room  environments, facilities for device fabrication, once-
               through air handling, and state-of-the-art vibration  isolation.  These
              improvements will greatly improve the  department's research and graduate
              training programs in  ultra-low-temperature physics, NMR studies of advanced 
              materials, mesoscopic physics, device fabrication, Langmuir  films, and the
              study of nonlinear optics.  ***
