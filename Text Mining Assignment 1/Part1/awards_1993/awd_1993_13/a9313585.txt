Abstract    :
              A light particle focal plane detector will be developed,                       
              calibrated and tested in an experiment at the Michigan State                   
              University Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory on the A1200                   
              Spectrometer facility.  The work will be done as part of a MS                  
              thesis project for Mr. Frank Underdown under the ROA program.
