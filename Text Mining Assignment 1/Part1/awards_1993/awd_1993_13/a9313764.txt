Abstract    :
              9313764  Chait  This research project deals with the development and extension
              of  the standard Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) diagonal  controller design
              to non-diagonal controllers for multiple-input,  multiple-output systems. The
              methodology incorporates the  interaction effects between control design at
              each sequential  loop closure in multiple loop systems, and emphasizes these 
              effects in  terms of the gain and phase margins of the closed-  loop
              transmission. The efficacy of the techniques to an active  noise control
              experiment in a three-dimensional asymmetric  cavity. The apparatus represents
              highly coupled transfer function  matrix from speakers to microphones, lightly
              damped resonance  frequencies in the three-dimensional acoustic space, and 
              uncertainty in modeling and identification of the transmission  between
              speakers voltage and microphone  sound pressure levels.  The research results
              provide a more effective design tool  compared to those currently available.
