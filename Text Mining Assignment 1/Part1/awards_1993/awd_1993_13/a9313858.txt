Abstract    :
              9313858  Rus  This proposal is for the first of a series of international
              workshops on algebraic methods and real-time systems in cooperation with the
              Algebraic Methods and Software Technology(AMAST) conferences.  This workshop
              would be hosted in the United States to foster collaboration in this research
              area among US, Canadian, and ESPRIT computer scientists.    The goals of the
              workshop are to provide a forum for bringing together practitioners in
              real-time systems development  and theoreticians in algebraic methods, to
              develop directions for the unification of these fields, and to integrate the
              software development practices.  The results of this workshop are expected to
              contribute to progress in algebraic methods for real-time and computer
              controlled systems.  Support for this workshop will ensure publication and
              distribution of the workshop results.
