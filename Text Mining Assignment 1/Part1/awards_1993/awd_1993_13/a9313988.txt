Abstract    :
              9313988  Cohen    This U.S.-Polish Joint Cooperative Research on Theoretical
              Studies of Nucleons and Nucleon  Matter is between Drs. Thomas D. Cohen and
              Derek B. Leinweber of the University of  Maryland College Park and Drs.
              Wojciech Broniowski and Marek Kutschera of the Institute  of Nuclear Physics in
              Cracow.  The research will focus on a variety of topics in low-energy 
              strong-interaction physics, such as the structure of individual baryons and of
              nuclear matter.   They plan to approach the problem using such techniques as: 
              chiral perturbation theory,  lattice gauge theory, large Nc analysis, heavy
              fermion dynamics, and phenomenological  models.  They will stress the
              connection between various theoretical approaches.  They will  use the insights
              of this work to make new phenomenological predictions.        This proposed
              research in theoretical physics fulfills the program objectives of advancing 
              science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine
              complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.  ###
