Abstract    :
              9313937  Farmer  The project will explore the problems of tunnel-current-induced
              defect generation and identification in the ultra-thin (<3.5nm) dielectric
              layer of metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) tunnel diodes.  This work is of
              current importance to the continued scaling of MIS device structures, and shows
              promise for revealing new information concerning the defects.  Novel tunneling
              methods will be used to investigate and model the dynamical, electrical and
              structural characteristics of these defects.  Both traditional, thermally grown
              oxides and new, more robust dielectrics will be studied.  ***
