Abstract    :
              9313675  Wiebe    As part of the U.S. GLOBEC NW Atlantic/Georges Bank study, Dr.
               Wiebe and collaborators will determine the broad-scale acoustical 
              distribution of zooplankton and nekton populations on Georges Bank  using a
              towed down-looking high frequently acoustical system  (operating at 120, 420
              and 720 kHz).  The towed system will be  deployed on the monthly surveys of the
              Georges Bank region designed  to cover the duration of the pelagic stages of
              the gadid  ichyoplankton.  The data will be analyzed to yield estimates of 
              spatial patchiness, relative abundance, and size distribution of 
              macrozooplankton, micronekton, and larger sound scatters.  The  acoustical data
              will be compared with size frequency and taxonomic  composition data generated
              from MOCNESS net collections.  The data  will be used as input into acoustic
              scattering models for accurate  descriptions of echosounder data where direct
              biological data are  not collected.  Acoustical estimates on animal density and
              size,  when combined with the hydrographic (temperature primarily), 
              physiological, and prey density data can be used to explore  spatially-explicit
              models of target species growth rates.
