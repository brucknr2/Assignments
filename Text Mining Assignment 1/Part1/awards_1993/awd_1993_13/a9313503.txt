Abstract    :
              Burnett          The Wistar Institute of the University of Pennsylvania is a
              renowned center for  biological and biomedical research.  The Institute
              occupies a building  constructed as an anatomical museum in 1894, and many
              areas of the building  do not provide an adequate environment for
              state-of-the-art research.   Four  laboratories in the area of structural and
              computational biology are being  consolidated into an interdisciplinary
              division on the third floor of the building s  west wing, which was last
              renovated in 1956.  In order to accommodate these  instrument- and
              computer-intensive research activities, this portion of the  building will
              require a new roof, installation of ductwork to the building s central  air
              conditioning system, installation of new fume hoods, and replacement of 
              plumbing and windows.  Rooms will be reconfigured to suit the research 
              activities, and modern lab cabinetry will be installed.        The renovation
              of the third floor of the Institute s west wing will bring  together a critical
              mass of researchers who share an interest in the structural  and molecular
              biology of proteins, and who share a need for instruments in the  areas of
              x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, image analysis, and  computers and
              graphical workstations for analysis of sequence and structure  data.  The
              renovated facility will support state-of-the-art instrumentation, enable 
              integration of research across these fields, and accommodate the training of 
              graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in these important scientific 
              disciplines.
