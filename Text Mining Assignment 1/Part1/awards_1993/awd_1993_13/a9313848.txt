Abstract    :
              9313848  Isenberg  This action is for continued support of an experiment in
              which  underground instrumented pipeline segments were constructed and 
              installed in a zone of probable earthquake rupture in Parkfield,  California. 
              The overall objective is to investigate the damage  experienced by buried
              pipelines due to strong earthquake shaking,  and to use data measured during
              strong ground shaking to evaluate  analytical models for predicting this
              damage.    Since 1857, seven earthquakes have occurred on the San Andreas 
              Fault in the vicinity of Parkfield, at an average interval of 22  years.  The
              last earthquake was in 1966, and the United States  Geological Survey (USGS)
              predicts, with a 95% confidence level, a  recurrence before 1993.  The choice
              of the site at Parkfield was  made with assistance from USGS geologists.  This
              experiment is  supported in collaboration with the National Center for 
              Earthquake Engineering Research in Buffalo, New York, and the  Urban Earthquake
              Hazard Research Institute of the University of  Tokyo in Japan.    The first
              objective of this project is to investigate the effects  of lateral offset on
              pipelines, a major damage mode, and to  provide data on the relation between
              ground displacements and  pipeline response in order to evaluate analytical
              models of this  damage mode. The second objective is to investigate the damage 
              induced by travelling seismic waves, another important damage  mode, and to use
              measured data to evaluate analytical models.  Whereas the first experiment
              requires that the surface rupture  cross the installed pipelines, the second
              experiment is dependent  only on the installation being subjected to strong
              ground  shaking.  ***
