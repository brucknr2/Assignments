Abstract    :
              9313955  Nicolet  Three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in 
              electronic materials between Marc A.-Nicolet of the California  Institute of
              Technology and Roland Madar of the Ecole Normale  Superieure de Genie Physique
              in Grenoble, France.  The objective  of their research is to study the
              reactions and reaction prodects  between silicon carbide (SiC) and metals. 
              They will focus on  reactions between a selection of thin transition metal
              films and  SiC.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration  expertise
              in the development of stable metal/semiconductor  contacts emphasizing silicon
              and gallium arsenide.  This is  complemented by French expertise in the
              synthesis of mono-and  polycrystalline refractory materials, especially metal
              silicides.    Silicon carbide is an attractive material for high temperature, 
              high power and high frequency electronic devices.  It is also  used in
              fiber-reinforced metal-matrix composites.  It is the most  promising material
              for high-power and high-temperature diodes and  transistors.  This project will
              advance understanding of these  materials and provide the basis for design of
              silicon carbide  devices.  ***
