Abstract    :
                9313720  Wheeler  This award will support work to develop software for
              alignment of  DNA sequences in a network of workstations.  The alignment of DNA
               sequences has implications in systematic biology, where  comparative studies
              give insight into relationships between  organisms and the pattern and the
              process of evolution.  These  algorithms for alignment will be developed for
              the parallel  processing environment offered by the network of workstations.  
              The award will test the scalability of these algorithms as one  moves to more
              processing units in the network.  ***
