Abstract    :
              9313505  Moss  The University of North Carolina at Wilmington, one of the 
              sixteen constituent institutions of The University of North  Carolina is in a
              period of transition, changing from a  traditional four-year college to a
              regional, multi-faceted  university.  The university has witnessed an increased
              enrollment  of students in the last ten years,  a trend that is reflective of 
              the growth experienced within the Department of Chemistry.  DeLoach Hall, home
              to the chemistry department, is a twenty-four  year old facility in need of
              modernization.  Faculty and students  engage in chemical research projects that
              emphasizes marine and  environmental chemistry, biotechnology and high speed
              computing.  However, present conditions within DeLoach Hall impede research 
              productivity.    Funds are requested to renovate laboratories by  replacing the
              HVAC system, providing needed fume hoods and  snorkel vents, and installing a
              research-grade cleanroom.  These  renovations will allow faculty and students
              to conduct research  of a high quality and enable them to embark on new
              research  areas, including collaborative projects with faculty from North 
              Carolina State University.  Furthermore, as a result of the  facility
              improvements, the department will be able to improve its  research training
              capability at both the undergraduate and  graduate level, thus better preparing
              students for graduate  education and entry into the nation's pool of trained
              scientists.  ***
