Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9313829  LUCHT      Uniform diamond deposition has recently been
              demonstrated in rich H2/C2H2/O2 flat flames stabilized in the stagnation region
              of a deposition substrate.  Diagnostics on these diamond forming flames have in
              general involved either emission or absorption spectroscopy with the usual
              drawbacks of line-of sight averaging or difficulty in relating intensity to
              total concentrations.  The PI plans to investigate the gas phase chemistry near
              the deposition surface (molybdenum) using laser diagnostics to measure
              temperatures, and major and selected minor gas phase species concentrations. 
              He hopes to achieve spatial resolution normal to the surface of 25 - 50  m. 
              CARS will be used to measure major species such as H2 and CO, and temperatures.
               H atoms will be measured using two photon Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and
              or Degenerate Four Wave Mixing (DFWM).  C2H2 will be measured using either CARS
              or DFWM and attempts to measure CH3 with DFWM in the ultraviolet or infrared
              will be made.  He plans a close collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories
              with both their theoretical and experimental programs currently underway to
              investigate these stagnation point flames.
