Abstract    :
              9318766  Bachmann  This award supports the participation of seven U.S.
              scientists, all  at early stages of their research careers, in a workshop
              co-organized  by Professor Klaus Bachmann of North Carolina State University
              and  Professor Hans Flietner of the Hahn-Meitner Institute in Berlin.  The 
              meeting will be held near Jena, in the eastern part of Germany, in  order to
              facilitate the participation of scientists from Eastern  Europe.  The objective
              of the workshop is to promote the exchange of  information and the initiation
              of international cooperative research  within the general area of
              non-stoichiometry in semiconductor  heterostructures.  Specific topics to be
              covered in the workshop  discussions include imaging and characterization,
              surface induced  ordering and stabilization of growth processes, and electrical
               methods for detecting deviations from stoichiometry at  heterojunctions.  In
              addition, the participants will examine the  relation of the properties of
              heterostructures to the composition,  structure and stoichiometry of their
              interfacial regions.        This area of materials research is of considerable
              current interest  and potential applications to electronic materials. 
              Innovative  research being carried out in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet 
              Union was not particularly well known in the West.  While this  situation is
              changing, the intentional east-west character of this  small meeting should
              considerably increase the exposure of that work  and greatly facilitate the
              development of new collaborative links  among U.S., German and Eastern European
              experts in this important  area.  ***
