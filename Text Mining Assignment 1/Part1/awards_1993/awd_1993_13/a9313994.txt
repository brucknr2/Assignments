Abstract    :
              9313994  Wynblatt    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  metallurgy and electronic materials between Paul Wynblatt of 
              Carnegie Mellon University and Dominique Chatain of the French  National Center
              for Scientific Research, Campus de Luminy,  Marseille, France.  The objective
              of their research is to combine  new, yet complementary approaches to studies
              of critical wetting  phenomena in co-exiting liquid metal alloys. The proposed 
              experimental research involves liquid gallium and lead. The U.S.  investigators
              bring to this collaboration expertise in surface  analysis techniques.  They
              will look at surface composition  measurements.  This is complemented by novel
              French techniques in  wetting measurements. The research is relevant to various
              liquid  metal processing techniques, including soldering, brazing, welding  and
              other liquid metal processes.   ***
