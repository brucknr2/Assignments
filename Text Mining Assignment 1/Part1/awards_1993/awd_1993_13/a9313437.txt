Abstract    :
              9313437  Newell       The Science and Technology Division of Shaw University  is
              housed in Roberts Science Hall which was constructed in  1924. Shaw University
              is an Historically Black University  with a strong tradition of preparing
              minority students  through research training for graduate school in the 
              sciences. The faculty's commitment to engaging students in  their research
              programs is hampered by the lack of suitable  laboratory environments. The
              building was recently remodeled  (new windows, paint, and flooring) but its
              electrical,  ventilating, heating, cooling, and plumbing systems are 
              inadequate for research and research training purposes. The  University plans
              to renovate the building to address these  problems, and to add modifications
              that will make the  building accessible to persons with disabilities.       The
              renovation of Roberts Science Hall will have  several important effects: 1)
              enabling faculty research in a  number of scientific disciplines; 2) creating
              safe and  suitable environments for research instruments; 3)  supporting
              research training as a part of the undergraduate  curriculum; 4) promoting
              student-faculty research  collaboration; and 5) attracting minority students
              into  careers in science and engineering.  ***
