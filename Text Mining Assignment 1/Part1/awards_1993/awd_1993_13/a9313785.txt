Abstract    :
              9313785  Emanuel        One and two day forecasts of weather in the midlatitudes
              at  the synoptic-scale and greater are highly accurate, and longer-  range
              forecasts simulate the general behavior, if not the details,  of the
              atmosphere.  Despite this, the dynamics of synoptic-scale  waves and
              instabilities are not altogether well understood.   Moreover, synoptic-scale 
              waves and instabilities are yet to be  parameterized as in terms of
              planetary-scale processes, even though  there is evidence that these waves are
              in a state of statistical  quasi-equilibrium with the planetary waves on time
              scales longer  than a few weeks.         This research effort involves two
              related objectives which are  directed at improving our understanding of the
              dynamical processes  involved in baroclinic situations.  The first is to deduce
              a  mathematical expression of an effective refractive index for Rossby  waves
              using balance approximations of order higher than quasi-  geostrophy.  The
              second is to develop and apply a methodology for  calculating climatological
              distributions of this effective  refractive index (a function of potential
              vorticity) from  observations, not a straight-forward task given the extremely 
              inhomogeneous distributions potential vorticity in the real  atmosphere.  Once
              these are determined, the PIs can better  understand the wave propagation
              characteristics in the atmosphere.   Their intention is to apply their results
              to the study of  atmospheric blocking events and low-frequency variability.
