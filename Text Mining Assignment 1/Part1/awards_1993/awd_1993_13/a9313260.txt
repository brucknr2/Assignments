Abstract    :
              9313260  Protopapas  This is a award to provide support for research, the
              objective of  which is to advance the macroscopic description of flow and 
              transport in heterogeneous soils, improve knowledge of the  microscale
              mechanism of fluid infiltration into soil, obtain a  better understanding than
              now exists of the effect that small  particulates have on field-scale fluid
              behavior in soil, and  accounting for randomness of the hydraulic properties of
              soil in  numerical models that are intended to describe flow and transport 
              properties of porous media.   The investigator plans to address  these issues
              both theoretically and experimentally by developing  new experimental
              techniques for analyzing pore scale  infiltration, validation of existing the
              existing theory  regarding unsteady infiltration in heterogeneous soils, and 
              improvement of the models that result from additional theoretical  effort and
              experimental validation.    Results of this project are expected to be utilized
              in  engineering design of water and wastewater management systems  that involve
              seepage from surface locations through soil and into  groundwater aquifers. 
              The work is also expected to develop new  laboratory methods and techniques for
              study of fluid behavior in  heterogeneous porous media, thus assisting in
              applying resultant  models in the engineering design of fluid management
              systems such  as artificial wetlands for wastewater treatment and cutoff walls 
              for containment of water, wastewater or hazardous wastes.
