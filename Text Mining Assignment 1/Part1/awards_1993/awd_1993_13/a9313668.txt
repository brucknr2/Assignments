Abstract    :
              Kimble  9313668       This proposal, "Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics",  involves
              an experimental investigation of the quantum  dynamical processes for a small
              collection of atoms strongly  coupled to the field of an optical cavity. The
              objectives  include an exploration of the linear and nonlinear  spectroscopic
              properties of the atom-cavity system as  manifestations of the underlying
              coupling-induced structure.  The synthesis of "arbitrary" quantum states of the
               electromagnetic field will be investigated by adiabatic  passage with the
              vacuum-field. Because of the strong  coupling of the atom and the cavity field,
              it should be  possible to explore measurement-induced localization whereby  the
              internal degrees of freedom of the atom-cavity system  become entangled with
              the atomic center of mass motion. It  is also proposed that the coupling
              achievable will be  sufficient to realize a one-atom laser. Finally, from the 
              perspective of continuous quantum measurement of open  systems, the atom-cavity
              system should be capable of  investigating the quantum-classical interface. The
               experiments will first look at cesium atoms in an atomic  beam interacting
              with the field of a very high finesse  optical cavity. These experiments will
              be followed by ones  using an optical trap. The experiments are intended to 
              exploit the atom-cavity system as a paradigm for the  investigation of quantum
              dynamics for open quantum systems  in the regime of strong coupling.
