Abstract    :
              9313898  Willsky    This three-year awards supports ongoing U.S.-France
              cooperative  research in image and signal processing among investigators from 
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of  California at
              Davis, and INRIA/Rocquencourt and Rennes (French  National Institute for
              Research in Computer Science and Applied  Mathematics).  The U.S. and French
              teams are led by Alan Willsky,  MIT, and Albert Benveniste, INRIA.  The
              objective of their  research is to investigate various problems in geometric 
              modeling, nonlinear systems, and image processing.  They will  study (1)
              multiresolution statistical signal and image  processing; (2) failure and event
              detection; (3) new approaches  to nonlinear parameter systems; and (4) discrete
              event systems.    The U.S. and French investigators have considerable expertise
              on  all these topics.  The project takes advantage in particular of 
              substantial French advances in nonlinear systems modeling and  different, but
              complementary, approaches to problems in discrete  event systems.  The French
              are also considered world experts in  systems described by partial differential
              equations.  The  collaboration will advance understanding on analysis and
              design  of circuits for signal processing applications.  ***
