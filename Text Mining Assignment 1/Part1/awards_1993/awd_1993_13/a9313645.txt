Abstract    :
              9313645  Kleinman  This proposal concerns a numerical and methodological first 
              principles approach to the calculation of the electronic structure  of large
              unit-cell systems both at zero and finite temperature with  a view to finding
              heats of formation, surface energies, surface  magnetism, elastic constants and
              so on. Specific systems for study  include 1) Boron carbides 2) Ge-GaAs
              interfaces 3) Rh(001) surfaces  4) NaK alloys and 5) Gd(001) surfaces. Work
              also continues with the  development of better pseudopotentials and better
              density  functionals for exchange and correlation - with a specific view to 
              improving descriptions of f-electron states.  %%%  The work described here is
              at the cutting edge of the general area  of calculating materials propoerties
              from a first-principles  atomistic approach. Metallic and semiconducting
              systems will be  studied as well as the more problematic heavy-metals. The
              proposal  concerns not only sophisticated "number crunching" to get at 
              specific properties of interest such as surface magnetism, melting  points of
              alloys, elastic constants etc., but also the basics of  how to do ever more
              reliable and yet faster calculations. This work  is in the top league of
              computational materials science in this  country.  ***
