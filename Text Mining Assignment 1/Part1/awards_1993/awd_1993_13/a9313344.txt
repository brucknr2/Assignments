Abstract    :
              9313344  Nibler  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program in the 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. J.W. Nibler of Oregon State  University will
              undertake an investigation of the formation,  growth, and surface/bulk
              properties of nanoclusters ranging in  size from 1 to 100 nanometers.  These
              clusters will be produced  in a supersonic expansion and their phases, and
              thermodynamic  temperatures, and other properties determined.  The 
              experimental technique will rely on non-linear Raman  spectroscopies,
              specifically the methods of Coherent  Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) and
              Stimulated Raman  Spectroscopy (SRS) as well as double resonance methods. 
              Clusters of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen molecules  will be the
              principal species investigated.  %%%  The study of large clusters is now wide
              spread in chemistry,  physics, and materials science and their fundamental
              properties  remain to be more fully explored.  Clusters composed of monomer 
              molecules having no permanent dipole moment are not fully  accessible to study
              by means of infrared spectroscopy.  In such  cases the Raman spectroscopic
              method is capable of providing  the desired information.  This research will
              provide  information on the structures, phases, phase transitions, and  surface
              effects of clusters.  This information will be of  importance for the
              development of theoretical models of cluster  structure and dynamics.  ***
