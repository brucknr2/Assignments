              Astronomical Studies with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory    This award
              supports research, technological development and student  education at the
              Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). The  Observatory consists of a
              precision 10.4m antenna enclosed in a  dome located near the summit of Mauna
              Kea, Hawaii. The CSO's  mission is to carry out spectroscopic and continuum
              observations of  astronomical objects in the wavelength range 1mm-350  m; the 
              opacity of the Earth's atmosphere to radiation at these wavelengths  is the
              reason for the observatory's location at an altitude of  nearly 4,300m. The
              observatory was constructed with funds from the  National Science Foundation
              (NSF) during the period 1984-1987. As  of this writing, it is presently the
              only US facility capable of  operations throughout the submillimeter
              atmospheric window.     Over the next three years, the CSO will continue to
              study the  physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium in the Milky Way 
              and other galaxies. This research will be carried out primarily  through
              spectral line surveys, searches for new hydride molecules  and by observing
              major interstellar cloud cooling lines, notably  those of atomic carbon.
              Planned technical developments include the  installation of a chopping
              secondary reflector, new feed legs and  new Cassegrain optics which will allow
              the introduction of  bolometer and SiS focal plane array receivers.   ***
