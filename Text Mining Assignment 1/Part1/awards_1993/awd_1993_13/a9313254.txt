Abstract    :
                  9313254  Lawley  Semisolid alloy slurries can exhibit thixotropic behavior. 
               Thixoforming is an innovative technique for the net shape  processing of
              alloys and composites with attendant integrity of  microstructure and
              mechanical properties.  The study will use spray  cast materials which exhibit
              a fine equiaxed grain structure devoid  of dendrites.    The goals of the
              proposed experimental-analytical-computational  research program are to
              understand the physical mechanisms of flow  in spray cast materials in the
              semisolid regime under conditions  that simulate semisolid processing
              operations, develop a  constitutive model that will accurately represent this
              behavior,  develop computational procedures that will facilitate the analysis, 
              design and optimization of semisolid processing of spray cast  materials and
              assess the microstructural integrity and mechanical  properties of thixoformed
              alloys and metal matrix composites.  ***
