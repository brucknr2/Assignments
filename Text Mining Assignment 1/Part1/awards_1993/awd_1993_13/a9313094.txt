Abstract    :
                    9313094  Markenscoff  High stress concentration occurs in thin ligaments
              between holes or  inclusions (fibers) or between these and free boundaries, and
              this  may be responsible for failure initiation in the material.  The 
              asymptotic behavior of the stress for thin ligaments will be  established.  ***
