Abstract    :
              Mirczak         This renovation project will modernize the Materials Research
              Center at  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  The building under renovation was
              built in 1965 and  has not undergone significant renovation since it's
              construction.  The plan is to  replace the roof; completely upgrade the
              mechanical systems to current standards for  air flow; provide a central
              chiller facility; upgrade and modernize the electrical  distribution system;
              test for and remove asbestos; eliminate city water cooling  systems; and comply
              with requirements for overall accessibility under the Americans  with
              Disabilities Act.  This renovation project will greatly enhance the ability of 
              researchers to perform complex research in a safe and productive manner.  The
              key  research areas that will be impacted by this project include materials and
               environmental engineering, chemistry, and biology.  Within these fields,
              strong  synergy has been developed and has become a spawning ground for new
              technologies  and their applications.  Within this building there are hand-on
              laboratories for  graduate skills training as well as the integration of
              engineering and science for  development of an energy and environment
              initiative crucial for emerging  technologies.  This building renovation will
              directly change the research and training  environment of 29 faculty, 12
              postdoctoral fellows, 121 graduate students and 136  undergraduate students.
