Abstract    :
              9313694  Shambaugh       In the melt blowing process, a fine polymeric stream is
               extruded into a high-velocity gas stream.  The force of the gas  rapidly
              attenuates the polymer stream to diameters as fine as one  micrometer or less. 
              Melt blown fibers are used commercially in  insulation, absorbent material, and
              filters.  Based on fundamental   momentum, continuity, and energy balance
              considerations, the  research will develop a comprehensive model that describes
              the  complex process of melt blowing.  The objectives of the work are to  (1)
              verify the model and use the model for optimization studies,  (2) model and
              test oscillating melt blowing jets, and (3) model and  test cold quench.      
              The model, the jet oscillation technique, and the cold quench  technique have
              applications beyond melt blowing.  Many of the  hundreds of commercial nonwoven
              processes--from papermaking to  geotextile fabrication to the production of
              carpet backing--could  benefit from the knowledge base developed in the work.
