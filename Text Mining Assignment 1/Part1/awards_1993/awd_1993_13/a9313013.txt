Abstract    :
              9313013  Karr       The nation's physical infrastructure, in particular, surface
               transportation, is in urgent need of restoration, improvement and  expansion. 
              Economic resources are insufficient to address all  aspects of the problem, so
              that rational evaluation of proposed  responses is crucial.  To this end,
              methodology must be deployed  for measuring characteristic of infrastructural
              systems, modeling  their properties and predicting their performance under
              various  scenarios.       The PIs select a set of key problems affecting 
              transportation supply and demand:  network modeling, an intrinsic  issue for
              Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems, with specific  attention to real-time
              route planning in current experimental  programs in IVHS; materials properties,
              with a focus on the  design and behavior of concrete pavement as well as
              fundamental  links between performance characteristics and microstructure of 
              concrete; and travel demand modeling that incorporates  travel/activity
              behavior of individuals to enable detailed  predictions of demand under various
              policy scenarios and,  eventually, how the transportation network is affected. 
                   For the systems, we study statistics is the enabling  technology for
              characterization and prediction.  Through cross-  disciplinary collaboration
              among materials, regional, statistical  and transportation scientists,
              strategies for short-term  solutions and longer-term improvements will be
              developed.  The  methods will be transferable to a wide range of transportation
               problems that rely on a combination of simulation models,  laboratory tests
              and field performance data.
