Abstract    :
              9313085  Bourdeau  The objective of this research is to develop an analytical 
              procedure to assess the stresses and the resulting  settlement induced in
              geotechnical structures by mechanical  interference between their components.
              The procedure will be  developed for the cases of interference between
              footings,  interference between retaining walls and footings resting on  the
              backfill. The procedure will be extended to modeling the  mechanism of surface
              applied load transmission in reinforced  soil retaining walls. The
              applicability of the proposed  model will be evaluated by performing scale
              model  experiments with x-ray imaging of the deformation field and  using test
              results in the literature.  The likelihood of  interference of geotechnical
              structures, and its consequence  on their performance will be assessed at the
              design stage,  and a criterion will be formulated.  ***
