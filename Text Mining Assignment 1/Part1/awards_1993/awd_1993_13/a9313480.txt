Abstract    :
              Knudson:  This award to the College of William and Mary will restore and
              modernize  approximately 630 square feet of research space for the Department
              of Chemistry.  The  renovation activity is necessary to adequately support
              current research and research training  activities at the College.  When Rogers
              Hall was built nineteen years ago, Chemistry graduated  a total of 20 majors;
              in 1992 the number of graduates more than doubled to 51.  During that 
              timeframe the percentage (80%) of students involved in research projects, and
              earning American  Chemical Society certification on their degrees, remained
              constant thus substantially taxing the  existing facilities.  The NSF award
              will support a year-long effort to modernize the research  facilities into wet
              laboratory space and will, in addition, correct substantial inadequacies in the
               HVAC system serving all Chemistry research space.
