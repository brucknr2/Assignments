Abstract    :
                   This support for a 2-day workshop in June 1993 on Shelter                 
              Island, New York to lay the groundwork for real cooperative studies            
              on the nature of the transition zone of the Earth's mantle.  The               
              convene will bring together a small number of active scientist from            
              the fields of seismology, mineral physics and chemistry, and                   
              geodynamics and provide a forum for interaction and serious                    
              discussion focussing on sharing knowledge and expertise (the                   
              "conventional wisdom:) of the separate disciplines and designing               
              new strategies for addressing the scientific problems.
