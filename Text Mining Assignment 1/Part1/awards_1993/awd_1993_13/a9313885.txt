Abstract    :
              Professor Kleppa is jointly funded by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Metals,  
              Ceramics, and Electronic Materials Program in the Division of Materials  
              Research to continue his research in the study of high temperature  
              calorimetry of refractory materials.  The major emphasis of this work is   on
              the thermochemistry of binary intermetallic compounds.  The research  
              emphasizes the following areas of high-temperature reaction calorimetry:   1)
              Thermochemistry of alloys of the lanthanide elements with late   transition
              metals and with noble metals; 2) Thermochemistry of alloys of   Group V
              transition metals with the late transition metals; 3) Mixing   calorimetry at
              1473 K, above temperatures where fused silica refactories   can be used; and 4)
              New applications of high temperature direct synthesis   calorimetry for studies
              of the enthalpies of formations between basic and   acidic oxides.    There are
              a number of applications which require materials which maintain   their
              structural integrity at extremely high temperatures even beyond the  
              temperature at which silica melts.  Binary intermetallic alloys between  
              transition elements, and between lanthanide elements and transition   metals
              have excellent refractory properties.  Kleppa 's research group is   one of the
              few remaining groups in the United States which performs   systematic
              calorimetric studies of binary intermetallic compounds.  This   research
              provides important fundamental insights into the way in which   properties of
              these materials depend on electronic structures of the   metals involved.
