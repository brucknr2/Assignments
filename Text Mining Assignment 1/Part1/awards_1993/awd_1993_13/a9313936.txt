Abstract    :
              9313936  Feng  The objective of Fundamental Speed  Limitation of Ga1-xINxAS
              Metal-  Semiconductor Field Effect  Transistors (MESFETs) and High  Electron
              Mobility Transistors  (HEMTs) program is to fabricate 0.05  um gate length GaAs
              MESFETs and  HEMTs, and to perform speed  characterization of these devices 
              over the microwave frequency band  (DC-40GHz) and over a temperature  range
              (300K to 30K).  This measured  information allows us to determine  the high
              field electron velocity as  a function of electrical field and  to develop a
              simple model to predict  the fundamental speed limitation of  0.05 um gate
              length of Ga1-xINxAS  MESFETs and HEMTs.  This information  also allows us to
              verify the  existence of the ballistic effect in  FETs.  ***
