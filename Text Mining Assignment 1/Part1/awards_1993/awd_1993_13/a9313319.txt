Abstract    :
              9313319  Futrell  The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University
              of Delaware conducts research and training in the specialty areas of
              enzymology, drug design and synthesis, catalysis, materials research,
              environmental monitoring and chemical waste disposal technology, along with the
              more traditional disciplines of chemistry.  They are currently at the midpoint
              of a ten year drive for excellence in chemical education and research.  By
              emphasizing the inseparability of teaching and research and involving
              undergraduates as major contributors to the ongoing research, they can serve as
              a model for other research intensive universities.  This award will allow the
              university to renovate their main facility for chemistry teaching and research,
              Fletcher Brown Laboratory, which is currently obsolete.  This renovation will
              facilitate cutting-edge research, improve education for the next generation of
              chemists, and attract outstanding new teacher/scholars and a more diverse
              student population.  The NSF award to this university will be matched by more
              than two to one and will enable state-of-the-art laboratories at the University
              of Delaware.  ***   u                                          ! ! " # $ % & '
