Abstract    :
              9313222  Ulsoy       The award is for the design and development of an 
              experimental, modular, open-architecture machining system  controller for
              prismatic and rotational parts that enhances part  quality by an order of
              magnitude while sustaining high machining  rates.  The approach would enable
              integration of underutilized  results of the prior work of various researchers
              as well as  generating new results.  The hypothesis of the research is that 
              information embedded in the control-loop error signals can be  effectively used
              to improve part quality and machining system  performance.  A hierarchical
              controller structure is proposed  consisting of compensators at the machine
              tool servo, process, and  part inspection levels.  Intelligent integration of
              hardware and  software components of the controller is proposed here by
              combining  expertise in machine tools, machining processes, sensors, control 
              theory, software architecture, and real-time computing.       The hierarchical,
              open-architecture controller is expected to  have a major impact on
              manufacturing practice and research.   Potential benefits for industrial users
              include reduction of part  manufacturing cycle times, reduction of indirect
              inspection costs,  controller improvement costs, and the cost of using sensors.
                Implementation of future machining research results would also be 
              facilitated by the availability of such a controller.
