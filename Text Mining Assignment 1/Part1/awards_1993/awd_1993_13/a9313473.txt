Abstract    :
              9313473  Ondov       This award to the University of Maryland allows them to 
              renovate the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry's  Environmental Low
              Contamination Facility.  This facility was  constructed in 1978, primarily, for
              the preparation and  handling of materials and samples associated with aerosol 
              particulate collections in urban and remote areas, and the  packaging of these
              materials for  instrumental neutron  activation analysis.  A laminar-flow clean
              bench, installed  at this time, continues to provide the department's only 
              clean facility for sample digestion and chemical separation.  Due to increased
              activity in this scientific area and due to  the deterioration of the facility,
              there is a great need to  modernize this laboratory space.       Based on
              numbers of Ph.D. graduates, the Analytical-  Nuclear-Environmental Division's
              efforts make the University  of Maryland one of the largest institutions for
              graduate  environmental research.  Recognized internationally for  their
              research in marine geochemistry, nuclear and marine  chemistry, and atmospheric
              aerosol chemistry, the Maryland  professors offer one of the few
              nationally-recognized  graduate environmental science programs, and one of the
              few  programs that train students in nuclear analytical methods.  Trends in
              environmental research continue to demand larger  numbers of analyses with ever
              increasing analytical  sensitivity, thereby intensifying the demand for
              improved  analytical technology, methods and concomitant clean room 
              facilities.  The renovations to be completed will support  the work of
              outstanding researchers in this field as well as  22 graduate students and
              postdoctoral fellows.  ***
