Abstract    :
              9313560  Branchini       The Chemistry Department of Connecticut College has 
              been housed in Hale Laboratory since 1953, and the building  no longer provides
              an appropriate environment for research  and research training. The College
              will renovate the  structure, installing: a new heating, ventilating, and 
              cooling system; new laboratory spaces for faculty research;  new research
              training facilities for the undergraduate  curriculum; facilities for
              biomolecular NMR research and  other computer-intensive activities; and
              building features  that provide access by persons with disabilities.       The
              renovation of Hale Laboratory will have a  significant impact on the quantity
              and quality of research  and research training that takes place in the
              Chemistry  Department. The department's faculty members have an active  program
              of research, and the building renovation will remove  several obstacles to
              greater research productivity. State-of-  the-art instrumentation will now have
              appropriate  environments, and experiments that could not be performed 
              previously will be possible in the renovated laboratory  spaces. The research
              training that is integral to the  undergraduate curriculum will be expanded and
              modernized as  a result of this renovation. Giving undergraduates access to 
              research environments and experiences such as these will  attract a greater
              number of students to careers in  chemistry.  ***
