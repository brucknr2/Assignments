Abstract    :
              9313578  Lee  The objectives of this study are:  1.  to develop a scattering 
              theory for surface waves in anisotropic media, 2.  to develop an  algorithm for
              numerical calculation of the scattered waves fields  and to perform direct
              computational simulation of the scattering  of waves, and 3.  to perform
              physical ultrasonic experiments to  obtain improved insight and understanding
              of the scattering  mechanisms in anisotropic media.  The proposed theoretical 
              approach will be based on the combination of the Born  approximation and the
              dyadic representation of the far field  Green's function for an anistropic
              laterally homogeneous half-  space.  Physical ultrasonic experiments will be
              performed to  ascertain the validity of the scattering theory.  ***
