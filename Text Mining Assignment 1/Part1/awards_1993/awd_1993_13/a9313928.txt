Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator has collected Helium/Tritium samples on  a
              hydrographic cruise along longitude 165 degrees East, designated  as line P13
              in the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  In  this project the PI will
              analyze these data, collect samples along  a similar line at 110 degrees West
              (P18), and integrate the He/Tr  data with other WOCE data to further study
              processes of Pacific  ocean circulation.  Principal focus of the study will be
              on upper  ocean ventilation, water mass formation, water mass exchange 
              processes, and rates of oxygen utilization and primary production.
