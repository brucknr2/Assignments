Abstract    :
              9313749  Tsui  An electron energy filter made of quantum well structures is
              found extremely useful in reducing the dark current of a quantum well infrared
              photodetector, and thus increasing the detector operating temperature. 
              However, the noise characteristics associated with this energy filtering
              process have not been investigated in detail.  We propose a 2-year research
              program to conduct an in-depth investigation of the noise properties of
              electron energy filters with different band sturctures.  The result will be
              useful in designing a low noise, high sensitivity quantum well detector.  The
              program will be carried out in three stages:  In the first stage we will focus
              on designing and fabricating different energy filter structures and setting up
              noise characterization equipment apropriate for the present devices.  The
              second will concentrate on the noise measurements and a physical understanding
              of the results, and based on these results,and based on these reults, we will
              in third stage be designing and demonstrating quantum well detectors with
              lowest detector noise and highest sensitivity.***
