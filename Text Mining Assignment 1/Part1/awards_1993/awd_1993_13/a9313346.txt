Abstract    :
              9313346 Barr          Benchmarking is the global search for industry's best
              practices, for use in improving an organization's products and processes. 
              Benchmarking is a process whose use as a part of total quality management
              programs is becoming widespread, but suffers from a lack of identification of
              best practice companies from within a group and metrics for evaluating both the
              degree of leadership by these companies and degree of inefficiency of aspiring
              firms          Because of the strong economic and mathematical underpinnings of
              the proposed approach, a framework for process improvement will be developed
              which provides proscriptive directions to aspiring companies for becoming
              benchmarks themselves.  Development of the optimization based support software
              (productivity tools) is a key component of this project.  These procedures and
              software will be validated on a particularly demanding service sector
              application.
