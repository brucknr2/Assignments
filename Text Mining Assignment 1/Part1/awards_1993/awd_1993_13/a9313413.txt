Abstract    :
              9313413  Eaton  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work
              of   Professor Eaton at the University of Chicago for continued   studies on
              the synthesis, reactivities, and properties of   polycyclic hydrocarbons based
              on the cubyl frame.   Characterization and utilization is sought of the
              dehydrocubanes:   cubene, 1,3-dehydrocubane, 1,4-cubane diyl, and the higher
              diyls.   Synthesis from 1,4-cubane diyl of rigid-rod materials of defined  
              geometry and lengths is sought. Oligo- and polycubanes will also   be pursued
              with focus on the synthesis of polycyclooctatetraenes   and polyacetylenes and
              is aimed toward generating materials with   conducting properties and with high
              carbon/hydrogen ratios.  %%%  In this project Professor Eaton continues to
              explore the   chemistry of the special class of polycyclic hydrocarbons formed 
               from cubanes. The emphasis of this research is on the   characterization and
              utilization of the various unsaturated   dehydrocubane systems. The research
              will venture out to soluble   rigid-rod materials of defined properties and
              conducting   hydrocarbons as applications from poly- and oligocubanes.  ***
