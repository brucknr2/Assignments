Abstract    :
              Auston          The renovation project to be undertaken by this award will
              modernize the  obsolete heating, ventilation, air conditioning and plumbing
              systems in the  research wing of the Seeley Mudd Engineering Center at Columbia
              University.   Malfunctioning mechanical systems have become a serious
              impediment to the  school's many advanced research activities.  Those research
              activities include  aspects of civil engineering, chemical engineering,
              engineering mechanics,  materials research, electrical engineering, biological
              sciences and mineral  engineering.  More than  21 faculty conduct research in
              the space to be  modernized along with 19 postdocs, 105 graduate students and
              32  undergraduate students.  This modernization project will have a tremendous 
              impact on one of the leading engineering training facilities in the nation.
