Abstract    :
              9313700  Gordon  This project is the analysis of the data set obtained as part
              of an  integrated research program into the oceanographic structure of the 
              western Weddell Sea.  The field work was carried out from an ice  camp jointly
              occupied by U.S. and Russian scientists from February  to June 1992.  The
              principal investigator's work was the lead  project in the research program and
              concerned the large-scale  oceanographic circulation and the variability of the
              Weddell Sea  boundary current, and how these affect and are affected by the 
              regional water mass formation and modification processes.    The Weddell Sea
              may be divided into three regions on the basis of  the energy exchange mode. 
              The warm regime occurs in the east where  the intrusion of warm circumpolar
              deep water keeps the water  temperature near +1 deg C.  The cold regime occurs
              in the center,  where deep water is overlain by a thick near freezing mixed
              layer.  In both regions however enough heat is seasonally carried to the  sea
              ice to melt it completely.  In the western region, the sea ice  cover does not
              melt, and the expected thermodynamic processes are  different.    Hydrographic
              data, coupled with the current meter observations and  chemical tracer
              experiments, as well as turbulent flux measure-  ments, and sea ice dynamics
              that were part of the field work have  already provided a unique picture of the
              Weddell Sea continental  slope processes.  ***
