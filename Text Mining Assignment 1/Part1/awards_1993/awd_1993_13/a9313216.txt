Abstract    :
                  9313216  Lee  An integrated study of the dynamic
              electromagneto-thermo-mechanical  behavior of superconducting materials and
              structures will be  performed.  Using the unified continuum-based approach, a 
              mathematical formulation, which can readily admit a finite element 
              realization, will be developed for a fully coupled analysis of  dynamic
              field-structure interactions in superconductors.    Two physical experiments,
              the vibrating reed (VR) and ultrasonic  measurements will be conducted.  The
              objective of the physical  experiments is to validate the proposed mathematical
              and numerical  model, and to better understand the physics of flux motion in
              bulk  superconductors.  ***
