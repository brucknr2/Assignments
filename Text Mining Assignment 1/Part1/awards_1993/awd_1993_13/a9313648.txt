Abstract    :
              9313648  Wu  This renewal grant concerns theoretical studies of lattice models 
              in statistical mechanics with emphases on exact results and  applications. 
              Lattice models which retain the essential physics of  real systems are crucial
              in materials research.  The research will  include the study of several two-and
              three-dimensional systems  which describe a wide range of physical phenomena
              ranging from  adsorption, percolation, directed polymers, and membrane 
              transitions, to high temperature superconductors.  In addition,  results of
              lattice model studies will be applied to analyze several  long-standing
              unresolved problems in the mathematical theory of  knots.  %%%  ***
