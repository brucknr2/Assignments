Abstract    :
              9313624 Adjouadi      This award provides infrastructure support for the
              development of research and educational activities in the Department of
              Electrical and Computer Engineering, and in the School of Computer Science at
              Florida International University.  The management of the program will be by the
              Center for Advanced Technology and Education (CATE), a state of the art
              research facility to integrate critical technology areas in computer and
              information science and engineering.  Project will involve software
              engineering, computer vision, neural networks, artificial intelligence and
              robotics applications, and computer aided education.  The unifying theme to the
              work will be concurrent processing. In the course of the projects both the
              graduate and undergraduate programs will be enhanced and revitalized. ***
