Abstract    :
              9313542  McMurtry  The Communications and Space Science Laboratory (CSSL) at the
               Pennsylvania State University is part of the Electrical and  Computer
              Engineering Department.  The research activities of this  lab range from
              shuttle-based observations of ozone and chlorine  monoxide in the atmosphere to
              rocket-based in situ measurements of  the stratosphere and mesosphere to
              ground-based lidar measurements  of these same regions.  Many of these
              activities require state-of-  the-art electronic instrumentation which is
              designed, constructed,  and tested at CSSL.  This award to Penn State
              University will allow  the modernization of lab spaces to facilitate the design
              and  development of spacecraft-rated hardware.  By improving  environmental
              conditions, the labs will become acceptable to both  faculty and students alike
              who are doing research on basic research  problems about global climate change.
               A class 10,000 softwall  clean room will also be installed to provide the
              proper conditions  for the assembly of flight hardware.  This project will
              better  enable research and the training of students studying the earth's 
              atmosphere.  ***
