Abstract    :
              Dickinson College, located in Carlisle, PA, is the recipient of ARI funds to 
              underwrite part of a renovation project for the Althouse Science Building, 
              constructed in 1957.  In order to improve upon a research oriented  curriculum
              in chemistry, existing laboratory space will be upgraded and  relocated to
              support research and research training in organic synthesis.   Phase I of the
              renovation project will relocated a faculty research laboratory in  proximity
              to a research laboratory for advanced students, and primary  teaching
              laboratories for the faculty member.  Space will be reconfigured to  provide
              modern research facilities for work in applications of organoiron  systems to
              organic synthesis.  Phase II of the renovation will upgrade research  training
              space and infrastructural utilities used for advanced synthesis  studies.  The
              student research laboratory will become the model for the  development of
              future research space for advanced chemistry students.  The  impact of the
              improved research environment will allow the Chemistry  Department to implement
              key aspects of a curriculum that encourages  students to deduce principles from
              research experience, and support the  investigative activities of faculty
              engaged in synthesis research.
