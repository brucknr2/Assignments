Abstract    :
              9313317  Corpe  This is an award to provide renewed support for a project the 
              objective of which is to characterize the sequestering effect of  polyphosphate
              bodies in picoplankton populations of aquatic  environments.  In previous
              research supported under NSF Grant No.  91-17165, the investigators developed
              an analytical technique  involving x-ray dispersive analysis in conjunction
              with use of  electron microscopy  to study the elemental composition of 
              individual cells and their intracellular components.  In this  renewal project,
              the investigator will focus on the various  mechanisms by which trace and heavy
              metals are taken up and  immobilized within the microbial consortium that makes
              up natural  aquatic environments.  The work is expected to result in the 
              isolation of numerically important, metal immobilizing species  from sediments
              contaminated by heavy metals and determination of  their propensity for metal
              uptake.    The role of microorganisms in the environmental cycling of metals 
              is of importance in bioleaching, biosorption and related  bioprocessing of
              municipal and industrial wastewaters.  Metals  are also present in sediments of
              streams, ponds, lakes and  estuaries where they can adversely affect water
              quality.  Results  of this research may be applied to modeling the diffusion, 
              dispersion and interactions of heavy metals of significance in  affecting the
              quality of environmental waters and in design of  processes and systems to
              decontaminate sediments and soil.  ***
