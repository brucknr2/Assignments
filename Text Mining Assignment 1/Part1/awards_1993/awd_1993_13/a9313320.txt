Abstract    :
              Whittaker   9313320       The award is for establishing a comprehensive research
              program  in chemical analysis and chemical modeling of plasma etching  reactors
              for semiconductor circuit manufacturing.  The chemical  analysis and modeling
              will be performed using chemically selective  diagnostic data obtained by a
              very sensitive implementation of an  infra-red diode laser absorption
              spectroscopy.  The modeling will  have the goal of establishing a new and
              predictive level of  understanding of the plasma etch chemistry.       The work
              is expected to have a direct impact on semiconductor  electronics and
              manufacturing technology.  The availability of the  diagnostic data will help
              in the formulation of predictive models  needed for improved etch process
              design and control, especially in  the processing of submicron features.
