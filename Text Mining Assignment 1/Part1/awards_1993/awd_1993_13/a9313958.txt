Abstract    :
              Demmel  The purpose of this proposal is is design, analyze and make widely
              available massively parallel algorithms for large sparse linear systems, large
              sparse nonsymmetric eigenproblems,and large dense eigenproblems.  Also proposed
              are new algorithms which are innovative numerically and with regard to their
              parallelizability.  These algorithms will be packaged in toolboxes which permit
              their easy reuse and performance for a wide variety of applications too
              demanding for any "black box" solution.
