Abstract    :
              9313797  Cotton  This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic 
              Chemistry Program supports research by Dr. F. Albert Cotton of the  Chemistry
              Department, Texas A&M University, into the nature of  metal-metal multiple
              bonding by transition metals.  Compounds  containing multiply bonded ruthenium
              and osmium are well known, but  in these investigations some unusual compounds
              will be synthesized  and characterized.  The scope of multiple bond chemistry
              will be  extended by synthesis of species containing V, Nb, Ta, Fe, Ir and  Pt.
               For some of the metals more commonly associated with this type  of bonding
              (Os, W, Re, Pt), new compounds in higher oxidation  states will be
              investigated.  In addition, the internal movement of  metal-metal dimers within
              the confines of the ligand cage will be  studied.  Also to be prepared are
              oligomeric and polymeric  compounds in which metal metal dimer units are linked
              by pi-  electron containing species, in order to probe the magnetic and 
              electronic interactions along the chain or within a sheet.    In dimeric
              compounds which contain two transition metals bonded to  each other, triple and
              quadruple bonds are sometimes observed.  The  goal of this research is to test
              whether this type of bonding is  possible with certain metals or metals in
              higher oxidation states  for which it has not previously been observed. 
              Research in this  area contributes to the basic understanding of bonding and 
              reactivity in organometallic cluster molecules, which have been  found to be
              important in catalyzing organic reactions.  Additionally, understanding
              compounds of this type contributes to  knowledge of some types of solid-state
              electronic and optical  devices and some potential anti-tumor agents.
