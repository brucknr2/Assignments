Abstract    :
              9313081 Occena          Over the years, the human sawyer has been making saw
              placement decision based on limited information provided by external defects,
              and whatever internal defects are eventually revealed on the cut log faces by
              the sawing pattern.  The planning of how the hardwood log can be sawn to
              improve recovery of high value lumber is hampered by the inability of the
              sawyer to "see" the internal defect location, orientation, and distribution
              inside the log.  With expanded export and domestic markets, low quality logs,
              increased competition from non wood products, social pressures to manage public
              lands for nontimber resources, and the reduced profit margin between log costs
              and lumber process, the hardwood products industry has been exploring
              alternative means of improving value yield.          This provides science and
              technology based methods and information that will benefit the hardwood
              products industry through improved product yield.  The recent work on the
              application of photon tomography and other means of non invasive internal
              scanning of solids have opened up new avenues in the log breakdown planning
              problem.  With new information related to internal defects, questions arise on
              how this new information can be put to best advantage.  Do we need to recognize
              each defect?  How do we process, organize, and interpret the internal defect
              information?  How do we use it to determine sawing cuts for primary processing?
               Can we use this information as a look ahead for secondary processing?
