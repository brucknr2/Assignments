Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
              research on photoinitiated electron transfer reactions by Dr. Karen J. Brewer
              of the Chemistry Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute.  Trimetallic
              complexes which covalently couple two light-absorbing metal centers to a
              central metal section through polypyridyl bridging ligands will be synthesized.
               In these complexes, low lying unoccupied orbitals on the ligand are capable of
               accepting electrons and mediating the electron transfer between metal sites. 
              The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these complexes will be
              studied in order to find the optimal conditions for promoting electron
              build-up, as well as to understand the details of multi-electron transfer.    
              Many important reactions in nature, such as the reduction of carbon dioxide and
              nitrogen fixation, require many electrons. The goal of this project is to
              investigate a method for promoting multi-electron transfer reactions.  Metal
              complexes which can each contribute electrons will be linked together in large
              molecules.  Light will be used to drive electrons between metal centers so that
              a number of electrons can be available for reaction. Although it is concerned
              with only a part of the process, this study is expected to provide basic
              information related to the development of solar-powered devices which could be
              used to promote a variety of chemical reactions.
