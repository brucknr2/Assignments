Abstract    :
              9313897  Conrad    The project aims to investigate two key issues of the
              behavior of  electrorheological (ER) fluids:  the effect of particle clustering
               in columns as compared to single row chains, and the relationship  between the
              flow stress and the current density.  The experiments  on particle column
              clustering will be performed with a pendulum  balance.  An attempt will be made
              to relate the observed  macroscopic behavior to particle arrangement, as well
              as to  specific atomic, ionic, and electronic mechanisms.  The research  will
              be carried out within the NCSU University-Industry Consortium  on ER Fluids
              which includes Texaco R&D, Bridgestone-Firestone  Research Laboratory, and Paar
              Physica, and in collaboration with  Ford Motor Company.  Cooperative Research
              Project (IUCRP), in  response to the announcement on Grant Opportunities for
              Academic  Liaison with Industry (GOALI).  If successful, the proposed project 
              on ER fluids will have applications in the development of flexible  operated
              machines in manufacturing, auto industry, textile, and  materials handling.
