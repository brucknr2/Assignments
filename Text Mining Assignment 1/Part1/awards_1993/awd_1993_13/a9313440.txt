Abstract    :
              9313440  Borders       The Chemistry Department of the College of Wooster has 
              been housed in Severance Hall since 1902, and the building  no longer provides
              an appropriate environment for research  and research training. The College
              will renovate the  structure, installing: a new heating, ventilating, and 
              cooling system; new laboratory spaces for faculty research;  new research
              training facilities for the undergraduate  curriculum; facilities for computer
              graphics and other  computer-intensive activities; and building features that 
              provide access by persons with disabilities.       The renovation of Severance
              Hall will have a  significant impact on the quantity and quality of research 
              and research training that takes place in the Chemistry  Department. The
              department's faculty members have an active  program of research, and the
              building renovation will remove  several obstacles to greater research
              productivity. State-of-  the-art instrumentation will now have appropriate 
              environments, and experiments that could not be performed  previously will be
              possible in the renovated laboratory  spaces. The research training that is
              integral to the  undergraduate curriculum will be expanded and modernized as  a
              result of this renovation. Giving undergraduates access to  research
              environments and experiences such as these will  attract a greater number of
              students to careers in  chemistry.  ***
