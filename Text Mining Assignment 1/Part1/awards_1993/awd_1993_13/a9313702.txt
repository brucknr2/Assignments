Abstract    :
              9313702  Collins       Concentrations of point defects in highly-ordered 
              intermetallic compounds are detected with atomic-scale resolution  using
              perturbed angular correlations (PAC), a gamma-ray  spectroscopy capable of
              differentiating clearly between defects.   An objective is to identify
              equilibrium and deformation-induced  defects in a variety of compounds. 
              Equilibrium (thermal) defect  formation enthalpies and defect concentrations
              are determined from  measured site fractions of probe-defect complexes using a 
              methodology developed during previous studies.  Deformation-induced  defects
              are compared to thermal defects and the concentrations  estimated from site
              fractions of probe atoms using PAC and  Mossbauer techniques.  A second
              objective is to examine the  microstructural evolution of materials subjected
              to high energy  mechanical milling.  Defects in volume sites and probe sites at
               grain boundaries and surfaces are monitored.  The effect of the  defects on
              destabilizing equilibrium phases is assessed.  %%%       The material defects
              under study here affect phase stability  and diffusion in advanced materials
              used in a variety of  applications.  ***
