Abstract    :
              Parkin  This award supports the renovation of 3424 square feet of  research and
              research training space  at the University of Iowa.  The Water Plant
              Laboratories of the Environmental Engineering  program at this institution will
              become modernized as a result of this project.  These laboratories  are
              currently used for one undergraduate and four graduate teaching laboratories, a
              water quality  monitoring project, and one research project.  There are also,
              five faculty with research  programs utilizing these laboratories.   Renovation
              of the Water Plant Laboratories will allow  the Environmental Engineering
              program to develop its current strength in bioremediation by  providing space
              to accommodate large bench scale and small pilot scale reactors, as well as by 
              adding additional high quality laboratory space.  The ability to build and
              study larger reactors  is critical in developing technologies that can be
              eventually field-tested.  Providing a relatively  dust-free environment will
              make placement of analytical instrumentation in the Water Plant  laboratories
              more attractive, and thus make the space more appropriate for the research
              currently  in progress in the department.  This renovation is important for the
              study of the environment and  the attraction of students into the field of
              environmental engineering.
