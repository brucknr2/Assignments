Abstract    :
              9313161  Khonsari  The bearing friction torque characteristics of model 
              instrument ball bearings for ultra-low-speed operation will  be determined
              experimentally and modeled theoretically.  The  pre-rolling rest slope and the
              steady-rolling friction  torque combine to trace out hysteresis loops which
              determine  the operating characteristics of precision positioning  mechanisms. 
              Both liquid lubricated and thin-film coated  surfaces will be studied and the
              generic characteristics of  these hysteresis loops will be correlated with
              lubricant  properties and bearing characteristics.  ***
