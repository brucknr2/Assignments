Abstract    :
              Vincent Vilker  9313009    This work is directed toward development of an
              economical synthesis  of oxygenated hydrocarbons using active cytochrome P-450 
              immobilized on a working electrode.  The immediate objectives are  to determine
              stoichiometries, product distributions, and kinetics  of the hydroxylation of
              hydrocarbons by NADH-driven P-450, to  develop modified electrodes for the
              regeneration of P-450, and to  compare products, rates, and yields of the NADH
              and  electrochemically regenerated cytochrome P-450.  Two forms of  cytochrome
              are studied:  P-450cam and P-450soy; the similarities and  differences are
              examined.  Hydrocarbon substrates include  norcamphor,  -pinene,
              1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin),  decahydronaphthalene (decalin), and
              naphthalene.  Regiospecificity  and stereospecificity are examined, turnover
              rates on the  cytochrome are measured, and models of the process are developed.
                 This should lead to an energy-efficient bioelectrochemical process  that
              combines the efficiency of electrocatalysts with the  specificity of enzymes,
              thus producing good yields of high-value  products with little unwanted side
              reaction.  The project is done  in collaboration with the duPont Company.
