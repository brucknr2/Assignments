Abstract    :
              9313334  Sherman  Research and research training activities are integral to the 
              success of the psychology faculty and students at St. Olaf  College.  The
              Department of Psychology is experiencing an  increase in student demand in
              cognitive science, neuroscience and  animal behavior research.  Holland Hall,
              home to the psychology  department, was constructed in 1924 as the college's
              first  science building and was last renovated in 1970.   Laboratories 
              designed twenty years ago no longer meet the needs of the current  discipline.
              This award will provide funding for the modernization  of psychology research
              laboratories at St. Olaf College.  The  laboratories that will be affected by
              the renovations involve the  areas of: perception, neuroscience, operant
              conditioning,  computation, psychophysiology and two support rooms.  The 
              renovations will rectify problems by configuring laboratory  space, making it
              accessible to persons with disabilities;  providing sound attenuated and
              electrical shielding where  necessary, and correcting plumbing, ventilation and
              climate  control systems.  This modernization will significantly improve  the
              infrastructure required for individual faculty,  collaborative, and
              undergraduate research and research training  in the Psychology department at
              St. Olaf.  ***
