Abstract    :
              9313330  Kota       This project introduces a novel class of mechanical systems 
              called compliant mechanisms for micro applications.  Compliant  mechanisms are
              single-piece flexible structures that deliver the  desired motion by undergoing
              elastic deformation as opposed to the  rigid body motions of conventional
              mechanisms.  Thus, the principal  objective of the project is to explore the
              possibility of using  compliant mechanisms in the micro realm to meet the
              atypical design  challenges posed by Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).    
                The study of MEMS is a fast growing area of research that has  an immense
              potential to help accomplish useful tasks in numerous  applications that
              involve mechanical manipulation at the micro  level.  This project addresses
              the design aspects of such systems.   Many researchers have demonstrated the
              feasibility of their  microfabrication technologies by building a variety of 
              micromechanical elements. They include rotary motors, linear  actuators and
              resonators, springs, grippers and gears all of which  are in the size range of
              few tens of microns to few hundreds of  microns.  The limited capabilities of
              the micromachining techniques  give way to new exigencies in fabrication and
              design at micro level  that are nonexistent in the macro machinery.
