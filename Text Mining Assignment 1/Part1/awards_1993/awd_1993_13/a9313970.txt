Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Non-destructive monitoring of fat reserves via measurement of                  
              total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) can provide vital                   
              information for understanding the dynamics of many physiological               
              and ecological processes in nature.  Patterns in energy storage                
              and expenditure are most obvious in small homeothermic animals                 
              with rapid metabolic turnover and mass changes, but previous                   
              TOBEC analyzers are too large for these otherwise ideal subjects.              
              I will use hummingbirds as subjects for validation studies of a                
              new, small-chamber TOBEC.  Their body masses are routinely                     
              monitored at territorial and feeder perches without significant                
              interruption of daytime activity.  They can be captured easily                 
              with mist-nets in natural habitats or at feeder-traps for TOBEC                
              determination of net gain rate.  I will examine a) body mass                   
              components that might distort "lean" nor "fat" values, b) effects              
              of ambient temperature, c) effects of body size (2-8 g                         
              hummingbirds, 7-12 g warblers ) due to positioning and ratio of                
              bird to chamber dimensions, and d) reliability of responses to a               
              full range in body composition changes through daily and annual                
              cycles (breeding, migration, winter).
