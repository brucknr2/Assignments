Abstract    :
                    9313153  Tippur  An experimental research program will be undertaken that
              explores  crack initiation and growth along material interfaces subjected to 
              thermo-mechanical loads.  This investigation will assist in  understanding the
              failure mechanics of engineering structures made  of polymer and metal matrix
              composites, adhesive joints in  aircrafts, and interfaces in layered
              micro-electronic devices.  It  is anticipated that the research will contribute
              towards modeling  the influence of transient thermal loads and thermal
              gradients on  crack initiation toughness and mode mixity and developing new 
              methods for characterizing fracture of bimaterial interface  subjected to
              thermo-mechanical loading.  The primary focus will be  towards understanding
              the transient nature of the pre-initiation  crack tip fields that lead to crack
              initiation and propagation   along material interfaces due to thermo-mechanical
              loading.  ***
