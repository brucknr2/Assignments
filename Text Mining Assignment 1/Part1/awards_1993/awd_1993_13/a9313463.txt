Abstract    :
              Bauerle         This facilities modernization award will help renovate about
              11,500 square feet  of research space in the Department of Biology at the
              University of Virginia.  The  project will renovate the basic electrical,
              mechanical, plumbing, and fire protection  systems of the two research floors
              of  Gilmer Hall.  It will also help renovate the  research labs of five faculty
              members and provide for construction of common  support facilities on each
              floor, including cold rooms, equipment rooms and media  kitchens.  Research in
              the targeted spaces will be multidisciplinary, addressing  fundamental
              questions in the areas of molecular and cellular biology, developmental 
              biology, and population and evolutionary biology.  All of the laboratories will
              be  training centers for postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate
              students.   The improvements will result in increased efficiency in space
              utilization, will provide  for laboratory facilities appropriate for current
              research activities and will bring the  affected areas of the building into
              compliance with current fire safety and handicapped  access codes, thereby
              establishing a safer, healthier, more productive work  environment for all
              occupants.
