Abstract    :
              9313678  Gifford    This project represents one component of a
              multidisciplinary,  multi-investigator program under the aegis of the
              U.S.-GLOBEC  Northwest Atlantic initiative.  The overall program, described in 
              the Prologue to this proposal, proposes to study the life histories  and vital
              physiological rates leading to recruitment of cod,  haddock, and their food
              resources on Georges Bank.  Specifically,  this project seeks to describe
              quantitatively and qualitatively the  nano- and micro- plankton prey fields on
              Georges Bank and to  measure consumption of nano- and microplankton organisms
              (i.e.  plant and animal prey 2-200 um in size) by early life history  stages of
              Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, and by all copepodid life  history stages of one of
              its major prey species, the calanoid  copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, under
              various conditions of water  column mixing and stratification on Georges Bank. 
              Ingestion rates  of consumers will be measured directly in shipboard
              experiments  using natural prey assemblages.  The proximate influence of 
              omnivorous feeding on the consumers will be interpreted in the  context of the
              in situ prey field and physical regime (mixing  versus stratification). 
              Ultimately, the influence of plant versus  animal prey in consumer diet will be
              addressed collaboratively in  the context of measurements made by other
              investigators of consumer  distribution, condition, life history parameters and
              production.  ***
