Abstract    :
              Strommen         Idaho State University plans to construct a new building for
              its Chemistry  Department, which has occupied space in a converted 1939
              dormitory since the  previous chemistry building was demolished in 1992 due to
              structural deficiencies.  The new chemistry building will include 16,000 square
              feet of research laboratory  space for faculty research projects, for training
              students in research methods, and for  student research projects. The
              department has a tradition of integrating students into  faculty research, and
              numerous students have co-authored publications with faculty  mentors and have
              given presentations at meetings of professional chemists.       The new
              chemistry building will enable a higher level of faculty research  activity in
              chemistry at Idaho State University, and will support exemplary research 
              training for undergraduate students. The new building will provide a safe and
              healthy  environment for research and training, and will provide appropriate
              conditions for  state-of-the-art instrumentation. The Idaho legislature is
              providing more than 90% of  the cost of this building, and this investment will
              benefit generations of scientists and  students.  ***
