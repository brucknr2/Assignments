Abstract    :
              9313345  Zwier  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and 
              Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at  Purdue
              University in the purchase of a Raman/fluorescence  instrument.  This new
              instrumentation will enhance the research  in a number of areas including the
              following:    Pump-probe studies of radical reaction dynamics under 
              tribological conditions, time-resolved Raman spectroscopy of  intermediates in
              inorganic electron transfer reactions,  transient Raman studies of
              porphyrin-DNA exciplexes, and  waveguide Raman spectroscopy as a probe of
              orientational order  during and after corona poling of molecularly doped and 
              functionalized polymer films.  The spectrometer will also be  used to collect
              dispersed fluorescence spectra of molecular  clusters in a supersonic jet and
              for Raman studies of zeolite  anchored bimetallic complexes for catalytic
              applications.  %%%  A Raman laser spectrometer can provide important
              information  about molecular structure, molecular interactions and  molecular
              dynamics in solution and on surfaces.  This sort of  information is necessary
              for a basic understanding of chemical  reactions.
