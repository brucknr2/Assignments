Abstract    :
              9313620  Paczynski    This research will be devoted to a theoretical search for 
              signatures of supermassive black holes in active (AGN) and  inactive (IGN)
              galactic nuclei.  In spite of decades of  considerable effort no firm proof is
              available for the presence  of supermassive black holes though very few
              astrophysicists doubt  their existence.  The work on AGNs will concentrate on
              various  effects of gravitational microlensing of the optical and X-ray 
              emission from the select group of quadruply macro-lensed quasars,  line the
              "Einstein cross" and the "clover leaf."  Gravitational  microlensing offers a
              possibility to study the source structure  on the smallest scale the structure
              exists, all the way down to  the Schwarzschield radius of a black hole.  The
              primary goal will  be to find a way to prove or disprove the presence of 
              supermassive black holes in AGNs by finding what effects the  finest space
              structure present in the source may have on the  observed brightness
              variability, and how to detect the presence  or absence of thick accretion
              disks formed from stars disrupted  by the supermassive black holes.  The
              primary goal will be to  find if the presence or absence of evidence for star
              disruption  and accretion can be used as evidence for or against the presence 
              of supermassive black holes in IGNs.    The Principal Investigator is regarded
              as an outstanding  theoretical astrophysicist.  ***
