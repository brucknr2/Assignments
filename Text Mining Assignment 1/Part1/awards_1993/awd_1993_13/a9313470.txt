Abstract    :
              Reklaitis         This award will support the renovation of the Advanced
              Materials Laboratory  in Chemical Engineering at Purdue University.  In 1987, 
              Purdue identified research  in the molecular and engineering properties of
              materials as a strategic area for their  contributions to science.  Following
              their strategic plan, they have put in motion a  process to strengthen the
              analytical processes involved in materials science as well as  improve and
              provide for sophisticated training of a diversity of students in this  research
              area.  Purdue has already acquired some of the latest and most sophisticated 
              analytical instrumentation for materials analysis but is now renovating the
              out-dated  labs in which  this instrumentation  is housed.  This renovation
              will modernize about  2600 square feet of lab space designed: 1) to support
              graduate and undergraduate  thesis research; and 2)to improve an innovative
              program for training students in the  design and execution of experimental
              research.  This renovation project will directly  impact 8 faculty, 44 graduate
              students, 4 postdoctoral fellows and a large number of  undergraduate students
              while increasing this institutions capability to do research and  train
              students in materials science.
