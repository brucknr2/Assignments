Abstract    :
              9313170  Silverstein    The main foci of this project are:  (1) documenting the
              sociolinguistic profile of a small community constituted over the course of
              rapid internal migration within a larger linguistic community; and (2) tracing
              the emergence of interdialectisms and hyperdialectisms as functions of factors
              such as access and orientation of members to standardizing media, how long they
              have lived in the community, and their age.    In this project, we apply
              quantitative sociolinguistic techniques to fluctuating dialectological
              phenomena and thereby attempt to account for hyperdialectisms through examining
              mechanisms of regional standardization.  We will gather both demographic and
              other ethnographic data with the aim of producing a more comprehensive account
              of the fluctuating condition of Thyboronsk.  The data will enable the P.I.'s to
              analyze the development of the dialect from its emergence through the
              macro-level processes of its regional standardization.  The ramifications if
              these processes are evidenced both linguistically and sociologically.    The
              project is intended to reveal what factors control and/or contribute to the
              formation and sustainability of local identities of small transplanted
              communities.  It will also explore the possibilities for developing
              quantitative techniques for evaluating and calibrating the validity of phonetic
              transcriptions of linguistic interviews.
