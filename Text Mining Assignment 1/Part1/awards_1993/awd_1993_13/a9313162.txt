Abstract    :
              9313162  Tlusty       The research is for investigation of the mechanics of
              high-  speed, thin-chip milling of hardened steels, taking into  consideration
              the effects of high pressure coolants.  The research  also involves
              investigation of the most suitable tool geometry, a  theory of chatter and of
              resonant vibrations for ball-nose thin-  chip milling, simulation software for
              forces and vibrations,  improvements in machine tool and spindle design,
              software for the  corresponding strategies of numerical control, and
              demonstration  and economic evaluation of this technology.       The research
              is expected to result in recommendations  concerning machining conditions,
              tools, tool holders, spindles,  machine tools, and programming considerations
              for high speed  machining of dies.  The productivity rates and surface finish
              are  expected to be better than those achievable by current electro-  discharge
              machining technology, and are expected to benefit the die  manufacturing
              industry.
