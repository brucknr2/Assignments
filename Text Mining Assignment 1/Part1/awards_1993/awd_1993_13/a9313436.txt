Abstract    :
              9313436  Guiltinan       This award allows Pennsylvania State University to
              renovate their  complex of six  greenhouses, a total of about 28,500 square
              feet of research and  research training space.   These greenhouses were built
              in 1949 and have not  undergone any renovation since that  time.  The types of
              research carried out in  this space include control of plant gene  expression,
              control of plant cell  expansion, biosynthesis of starch, plant growth 
              regulation, effects of air  pollutants on plants, and the molecular basis of
              cell recognition  in plants.  These  greenhouses are also used for various
              graduate and undergraduate  courses in  plant science and specifically an
              interdisciplinary training program in  advanced  root biology.  These
              facilities are used by 20 faculty, 8 postdoctoral fellows,  60  graduate
              students and about 145 undergraduate students. Thus, the renovations  will 
              impact a large number of mature researchers and existing research projects  but
              a larger  number of students being trained in biotechnology issues concerning 
              plant science.  This  modernization project is important because of it's
              potential  regional and national impact  on the growing biotechnology
              infrastructure.  ***
