Abstract    :
              9313466  Mourou    This award will support the renovation of laboratory space
              for the Science and  Technology Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the
              University of Michigan.  This  renovation project will convert about 4000
              square feet of lab space, previously used for  biophysical research, into
              usable space for optical research by reconfiguring it, adding  updated
              electrical supports, adding cooling for large frame lasers,  modern air
              conditioning,  ceiling, cabinetry, and changing the floors.   This STC has a
              strong commitment to K-12  education and college education and offers students
              the opportunity to perform experiments in  laser optics and to have contact at
              an early age with  this type of research environment.  This  STC also has
              strong ties to industry while working with 20 companies, it has spun off three 
              small companies and five of it's laser products have already found their way to
              the market  place.  This renovation project will directly impact about 70
              researchers working on an  interdisciplinary program that combines physics,
              chemistry, engineering and medicine.  This  research space modernization
              project will bolster the activities in a critical technology area  for the
              country, ultrafast optics.   ***
