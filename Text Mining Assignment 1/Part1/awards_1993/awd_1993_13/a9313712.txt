Abstract    :
              9313712  Gombosi    Dynamics of Cometary Environments.    Dr. Gombosi will
              continue his theoretical studies of dusty cometary gas  flows and the solar
              wind interaction with comets.  Dr. Gombosi is  participating in the development
              of a new solution, adaptive,  multidimensional, numerical methodology.  He will
              apply this new technology  to multiscale phenomena in comet environments.  The
              major advance of the  proposed over previous models is the use of adaptively
              refined meshes, so  that high resolution can be achieved in areas such as the
              edges of active  regions, the sonic transition region in cometary jets,
              cometary bow shocks,  the diamagnetic cavity boundary, or the very thin
              recombination layer near  the contact surface.
