Abstract    :
                    9313971  Shneiderman    This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to
              investigate the  interactive operation of multiple windows where the sources of
               information are located and coordinated invarious windows, with the  purpose
              of improving performance and reducing the number of errors  and user
              frustration that might other wise occur in the handling of  one window at a
              time.  The methodology used in the development  utilizes metrics, a taxonomy of
              tasks, and builds multiple-windows  coordination prototypes using hierarchiacal
              browsers and advanced  widgets.  Usability tests are conducted with experienced
              computer  users.  This work should impact the classical and limiting use of 
              independent overlapped window management strategies which have  dominated and
              remained unchanged for the last decade.
