Abstract    :
              9313875  Goodman  In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Lionel Goodman of the Department of  Chemistry of
              Rutgers University will study the methyl group  internal rotational motions in
              a number of molecules using the  techniques of Rydberg and ZEKE (Zero Kinetic
              Energy)  spectroscopy.  The shapes and heights of the torsional  potential
              barriers in the ground-, radical cation-, and excited  Rydberg states will be
              obtained in order to provide data for  testing molecular models for internal
              rotation potentials.  %%%  The torsional motions of methyl groups in molecules
              are  presently under intensive investigation for the insight that  they provide
              to the problem of intramolcular vibrational energy  redistribution (IVR). The
              goal of controlling chemical  reactions by laser excitations requires an
              understanding of how  the excitation energy flows into various possible
              reaction  channels. Methyl group torsional motions can be studied in an 
              accessible region of the spectrum and offer a one dimensional  theoretical
              model for tracking IVR.  ***
