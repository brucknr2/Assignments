Abstract    :
              9313586  Shahidehpour       This study considers a fuzzy set formulation of the
              optimal  reactive power planning, taking into account the static security 
              constraints and uncertainty in load values.  The overall solution  will be a
              compromise between least cost planning (lower  investment and operation costs)
              and security (tighter feasible  region).  The planning process will be
              decomposed into investment  and operation problems via the generalized Benders
              decomposition.   The operation problem will be decomposed into 4 subproblems
              via  the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition.  Practical examples will be  considered
              for the applicability of the proposed approach to  multi-area power systems.
