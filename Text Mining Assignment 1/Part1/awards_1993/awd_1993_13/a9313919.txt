Abstract    :
              The BOREXINO collaboration proposes the construction of a  real time liquid
              scintillator detector for the detection of  low energy neutrinos including the
              monoenergetic Be-7 source  at 0.86 MeV.  The proposed detector would utilize an
              active  volume of 100 tons of ultra-pure liquid scintillator  contained within
              an ultra pure nylon inner vessel surrounded  by a water shield and viewed by
              1650 photomultiplier tubes.  The project is proposed by an international
              collaboration  from USA, Italy, Germany and Russia.  It will be sited in  the
              Laboratori Nationali Gran Sasso, an international  underground particle physics
              laboratory in Italy.  The  project is approved for siting in the Gran Sasso Lab
               contingent on a demonstration, the Counting Test Facility  (CTF), is currently
              under construction and should begin  operation later this year with results
              expected beginning in  early 1995.  The US groups, led by the Princeton
              University  group, propose to undertake responsibilities for the  containment
              vessel and scintillator purification system for  both CTF and BOREXINO.  ***
