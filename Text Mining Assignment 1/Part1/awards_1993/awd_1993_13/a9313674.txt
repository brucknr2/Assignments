Abstract    :
              9313674  Wiebe          Wiebe and collaborators will establish and operate a 
              Program Service and Data Management Office for the U.S.  GLOBEC Northwest
              Atlantic Georges Bank program.  This  Program will investigate the potential
              effects of climate  change on the Georges Bank ecosystem through understanding 
              of the physical and biological  processes which control the  zooplankton and
              larval  fish populations on the bank.  The  Program Service and Data Management
              Office will provide the  basic common services, logistical support, and data 
              management required by the principal investigators (and the  Program)  as they
              conduct their field research, analyze the  data from their individual efforts,
              and integrate the  results with those from other research components.  For this
               initial phase of the Georges Bank Program, the Chairman of  the Executive
              Committee will serve as the operational  coordinator and will oversee the
              Office.
