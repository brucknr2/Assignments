Abstract    :
              9313822  Shimizu    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in geochemistry and petrology.  U.S. investigators, Nobumichi 
              Shimizu and Peter Kelemen of Woods Hole Oceanographic  Institution, J. Quick of
              the U.S. Geological Survey and G.  Wasserburg of the California Institute of
              Technology, will  collaborate on studies of the Oman ophiolite with French 
              investigators, Aldophe Nicolas and Delphine Bosch of the  University of
              Montpellier, II.  Ophiolites are exposed sections  of the ocean's crust formed
              by volcanic and igneous rock  accretions at mid ocean spreading centers.  The
              objective is to  conduct integrated field and laboratory studies of mantle 
              periodites and melt migration in mantle rocks as preserved in the  Oman
              ophiolite. This ophiolite is especially suitable due to its  exposure and
              thickness of its residual mantle. The results of the  study will advance
              understanding of the physical processes  involved in mid-ocean ridges and
              formation of oceanic crust.    The U.S. and French groups will carry out
              extensive sampling in  northern Oman followed by data analysis and meetings in
              the U.S.  The investigators cover many disciplines including structural 
              geology, petrology, trace element geochemistry, and isotope  geochemistry.  The
              project takes advantage of significant French  expertise on the Oman ophiolite
              and provides access to detailed  structural mapping developed by the French
              group.  ***
