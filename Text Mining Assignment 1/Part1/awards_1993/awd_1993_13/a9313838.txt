Abstract    :
              9313838  Wu  In this project, computer models are developed for predicting noise
              levels inside a moving vehicle passenger compartment. Using these models,
              engineers are able to optimize vehicle design alternatives, and improve
              interior noise comfort level. The investigation provide a better understanding
              of the physics involved in sound generation and transmission mechanisms due to
              random acoustics, vibrations, and turbulent boundary-layer excitations. In
              addition, the results form a useful input to the development of design criteria
              for vehicle panel structures, sub-structures, and joint connections in order to
              minimize vibration and sound transmission into the passenger compartment.
              Coupled with vehicle structure and aerodynamic models, the acoustic models from
              this research project form a powerful design tool for accurately simulating the
              sound field inside a moving vehicle, and identifying the parameters that play a
              critical role in  both vehicle pass-by noise radiation and noise levels within
              the passenger compartment.  ***   v       s  t
