Abstract    :
                    9313302  Sharpe  The same processes used to make integrated circuits have
              been  adapted to fabricate microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) from  ceramics
              and metals.  The resulting device has planar dimensions on  the order of tens
              to hundreds of micrometers and thicknesses on the  order of micrometers. 
              Engineers are now able to design a component  and predict its overall elastic
              response with confidence.  However,  they cannot yet predict the allowable
              static load or the life of a  component subjected to cyclic loading because
              those properties of  the materials are not available.  Furthermore, it is not
              at all  certain that standard design practices will scale to such a small  size
              because the microstructural features become increasingly  important.  The first
              objective of this research project is to  measure the strength and fatigue
              properties of thin specimens of  materials such as single- and poly-
              crystalline silicon and silicon  nitride that are commonly used in MEMS.  The
              testing required to  ascertain these properties will be performed on
              microsamples 200  micrometers wide by 200 micrometers thick in a tiny stainless
              steel  load frame with an external actuator and load cell.  The  significant
              feature of this method is that strain is measured  directly on the specimen
              over a gage length of 200 micrometers with  laser interferometry; this avoids
              the uncertainties that arise when  the overall elongation of the specimen is
              used to compute strain.   The second objective of the project is to use the
              strength and  fatigue data to design a prototype device that can be evaluated
              and  tested.  The device is a micro-scissors capable of cutting 10  micrometers
              diameter objects and having an overall length of 150  micrometers.  Scissors
              like these have potential for use in  minimally invasive microvascular surgery.
