Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for research on coherence and  fluctuations in quantum
              optics.  The proposal calls for  observations of nonclassical features in the
              second order  intensity correlation function of the light produced by 
              interfering the output of an optical parametric oscillator  with a coherent
              local oscillator and, secondly, to  characterize the photon counting statistics
              of an optical  parametric oscillator as it is taken from below threshold, 
              through threshold, to above threshold.  These investigations  are a stepping
              stone to studies of novel phenomena in atomic  spectroscopy, nonlinear optics
              and precision measurements  using light from these sources.
