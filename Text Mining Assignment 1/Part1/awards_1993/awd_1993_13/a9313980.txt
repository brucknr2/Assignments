Abstract    :
              Saccocia  9313980               The PIs will study oxygen-siotopic and D/H
              fractionation in  serpentine, talc, and brucite from mid ocean ridge
              environments,  ophiolites and alpine peridotites. The results will provide much
               needed foundation of experimental data to apply stable  isotopes in
              interpreting alteration history of ultramafic rocks.  The new data will also
              lead to an understanding of the  mineral-mineral and mineral-water
              geothermometers. It  would also lead to an understanding of the depth of
              circulation of  hydrothermal fluids and impact of serpentinization on tectonic 
              evolution of mid-ocean ridges.
