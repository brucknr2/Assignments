Abstract    :
              Okamura         The University of California at Riverside has 23 faculty members
              in the  Department of Chemistry that require a reliable supply of chilled water
              for their  research and research training activities.  Currently, this
              department is without such a  supply and this fact is compromising their
              research efforts.  The research activities in  which these faculty are involved
              include organometallic chemistry, laser-assisted  Fourier transform mass
              spectrometry, design, synthesis and characterization of  oligonucleotide
              analogs, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,  organic chemistry  and
              biochemistry.  Approximately 78 personnel use the chill water facility on a 
              regular basis. including students and postdocs.  The modernization of this
              facility will  make more reliable the availability of a shared resource
              necessary to carry-out  sophisticated chemical research and research training
              that impacts greatly materials  research in this country.
