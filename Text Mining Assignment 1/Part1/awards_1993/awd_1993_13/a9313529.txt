Abstract    :
              9313529  Hu  The University of California at Santa Barbara will use this  award
              to modernize a research facility in order  to  appropriately house a custom,
              high-resolution electron  beam  writing machine.  The machine (VS1) was made
              available to  this university by a donation from IBM.  It will provide a 
              unique sub-micron lithography tool capable of registration  and alignment over
              large areas, commensurate with a  "manufacturing" quality machine.   The proper
              operation of  the machine requires precise control of the local  environment:
              temperature and humidity of the ambient must be  kept within a limited range. 
              Appropriate vibration  isolation  of this machine is also essential.  The
              situation  of the VS1 will be adjacent to the clean room fabrication  area
              which is an  optimal location from the point of view of  easy access to and
              integration with the total  device/structure fabrication process.  This award
              will allow  the university to ensure that this facility gets optimum use  by
              modernizing the structural, electrical and air handling  capabilities required
              for the operation of the VS1.  This  facility will form a critical capability
              of a research  effort that already encompasses over 100 graduate students, 
              postdoctoral fellows and faculty in the Departments of  Electrical and Computer
              Engineering, Materials, Physics and  Chemistry.    This "in house" capability
              allows the  formation of test structures that facilitate rapid prove-in  of
              novel device concepts, but also allows rapid turn-around  and adjustment of
              technology and processes.  ***
