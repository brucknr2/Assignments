Abstract    :
              Abbaschian          This award will support the modernization of the Materials
              Science and  Engineering Department at the University of Florida.  This
              department is housed  in Rhines Hall, a building that was constructed in 1950
              as a physical plant shop  and renovated in 1968 to provide research space for
              materials science.  The  scope of this renovation project will: 1) develop
              three quasi-clean rooms; 2)  develop a furnace room; 3) replace the electrical
              system; 4) add a closed-loop  instrument cooling water system for 22 rooms; 5)
              upgrade the air conditioning  and air handling systems; and 6) replace a number
              of fume hoods.  This project  will modernize 20,844 square feet of research and
              research training space  which will enhance space utilization and provide
              up-to-date laboratories for  several principal research areas in materials
              science and in an interdisciplinary  research affiliate, the MICROFABRITECH
              Program. This thorough renovation of  the research infrastructure will have its
              major impact on the quality, quantity and  efficiency of research and  research
              training.  The goal is to shorten the time  delay between fundamental research
              and applications,  enhance the  development of university-industry
              partnerships.  This project will impact 25  faculty, more than 20 research and
              technical staff, 157 graduate students and  120 undergraduate students.
