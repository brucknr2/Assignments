Abstract    :
              9313856  Marston  Electronic many-body processes play an important role in
              charge  transfer between hyperthermal (greater than thermal velocity) atoms 
              and the surfaces off which they scatter.  Many-body correlations  are intrinsic
              to any theory of dynamical charge transfer which  includes electron spin,
              multiple charge and excited atomic states.  This proposal focusses on these
              correlations and tries to model  specific real systems.  Understanding the
              roles of Auger processes,  electron-electron interactions in the atom and the
              substrate and  the limitations of present models and their systematic solution
              are  some of the principal problems to be addressed.  Complicated (more 
              complex than alkali metal) impinging atoms such as oxygen and  semiconducting
              target surfaces are to be studied.  %%%  This work has direct significance in
              the understanding of  interactions at surfaces - eg the glow of atoms and
              molecules  bombarding the space shuttle in orbit.  It concerns the many-body 
              description of how high energy atoms scatter off surfaces.  The  work makes use
              of recent innovations in field theory to deal with  these dynamical strongly
              correlated electronic systems.  The  proposal concerns treating non-trivial
              impinging atoms and  non-trivial surfaces - where the qualifiers here mean that
              their  electronic structure has to be handled by sophisticated methods.  ***
