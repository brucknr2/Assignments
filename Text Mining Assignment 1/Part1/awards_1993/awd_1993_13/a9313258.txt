Abstract    :
              9313258   Levon    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will examine a new
              method  of ordering fullerenes.  This is accomplished by having suitable 
              substituents on the fullerene that favor ordering, or by the use of 
              substituted rigid polymers with side chains into which the  fullerenes fit. 
              These new composite materials are unknown at this  time, and an exploratory
              examination of their synthesis, structure,  and properties will be carried out
              by Prof. Kalle Levon of  Polytechnic University in collaboration with Prof.
              James Tour of  the University of South Carolina.  ***
