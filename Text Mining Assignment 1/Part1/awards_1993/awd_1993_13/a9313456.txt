Abstract    :
              Doherty          This renovation project will remodel  research space in the
              Chemical  Engineering Department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
              This  department is one of the leading research institutions for chemical
              engineering  in the United States, ranking consistently in the top 15
              departments nationwide  on the basis of Ph. D. degrees awarded.  This
              renovation project will modernize  a substantial fraction of their wet lab
              space that  was built in the 1920s and is  now obsolete.  The NSF support will
              also permit renovations that are badly  needed in order to comply with the
              Americans with Disabilities Act.  The  renovation will support research
              activities in Process Design and Control,  Polymer Engineering, Applied
              Theoretical Chemistry, and Catalysis and  Reaction Engineering.  The improved
              facilities capabilities will strengthen both  programs focused on experimental
              studies of materials and surfaces as well as  programs emphasizing
              computational modeling research.  Finally, the renovated  laboratories will
              also impact graduate training in the scientific areas involved.
