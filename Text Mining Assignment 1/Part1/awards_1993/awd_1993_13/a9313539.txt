Abstract    :
              Mertzman    Franklin and Marshall College is an independent coeducational 
              college with a long history of distinction in science education.  In order to
              sustain its record of producing quality students in  the sciences, the college
              is undertaking a major renovation of  the Pfeiffer Science Building, a 25 year
              old facility that houses  the departments of geosciences, physics, chemistry
              and astronomy.  This represents the first step in a more comprehensive $8
              million  renovation for the entire science complex.  Students actively  engage
              in the research enterprise by participating in the  student-faculty research
              program.  The program has been a  valuable and productive effort, one of the
              largest in the  country.  However,  despite the breath of scientific endeavors,
               the basic requirements of the research programs exceed the  current
              limitations of the building in terms of temperature and  humidity control,
              operable fume hoods, and the accessibility to  distilled water.    This award
              will provide the funds required to modernize 30,214  square feet of research
              and research training space.  Renovations  will include:  modifying electrical
              and plumbing systems,  installing a distilled water system and an effective
              ventilation  and air conditioning system, and improving the fume hood system 
              to comply with EPA standards.  These renovations will provide a  safe, physical
              environment conducive to quality faculty and  student-faculty research. 
              Engaging undergraduate students in  science by allowing them to do research has
              been and will  continue to be a fundamental strength of Franklin and Marshall 
              College.  ***
