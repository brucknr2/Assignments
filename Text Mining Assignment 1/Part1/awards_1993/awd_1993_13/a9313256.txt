Abstract    :
              9313256  Raman    Description:  This project will support two  scientists, Dr.
              Sethu Raman, of North Carolina  State University, and M.P. Singh, of the Indian
               Institute of Technology, New Delhi, and their  graduate students, to continue
              and complete a  collaborative research on the observations and  modeling of
              atmospheric turbulence and  diffusion at low wind speeds.  The main  objective
              of the study is to determine the  variation of turbulence and diffusion
              processes  in the surface layer during daytime convective  conditions and
              nighttime stable conditions.   Another part involves test and development of a 
              reliable model to predict diffusion in low wind  speeds.    Scope:  This
              project deals with modeling of  weather conditions in a tropical area, which 
              applies to many of the countries in South Asia  and South East Asia.  The two
              scientists have  set up elaborate facilities in India for  measuring
              atmospheric conditions at all times,  and are developing and adapting computer
              models  that can be tested and modified to best  describe the prevailing
              conditions in the  region.  The completion of the work is  important to reach
              reliable models of  dispersion at low wind speeds.  Such models  have many
              applications such as in predicting  dispersion of industrial or chemical
              pollutants  in warm climates.  The interaction between the U.S. and Indian 
              sides is clearly beneficial to the research of  the two scientists and in
              developing new human  resources in the two countries.  ***
