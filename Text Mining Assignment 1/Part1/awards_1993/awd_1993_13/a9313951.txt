Abstract    :
              9313951  Darensbourg    The primary purpose of this U.S.-Hungary research
              project between  Dr. Donald J. Darensbourg of Texas A&M University and Dr.
              Ferenc  Joo of Kossuth University, Debrecen, Hungary, is to explore the 
              special effects which should be considered when water is used as  a solvent in
              organometallic catalytic processes.  To do this, the  researchers will study
              the use of aqueous solutions as media for  reactions catalyzed by
              organometallic complexes with sulphonated  tertiary phosphine or
              phosphaadamantane ligands.  Four areas will  be examined in detail: 1) hydrogen
              transfer reactions; 2)  reactions of water-soluble phosphines with aldehydes
              and olefins;  3) reactions of carbon dioxide in aqueous solutions; and 4) new 
              reagents for organometallic chemistry in aqueous solutions.   Results are
              expected to improve our understanding of the  properties of catalyst recovery
              and recycle-ability afforded by  catalytic chemical processes carried out in
              aqueous solutions.    This project in organic chemistry fulfills the program
              objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in 
              the U.S. and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and  pool research
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and  competence.  ***
