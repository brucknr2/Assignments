Abstract    :
              Zakin         This award will help support the renovation of  about  3000 square
              feet of laboratory space in the Chemical  Engineering building at Ohio State
              University.  This  laboratory space is used for research and research training 
              in the areas of biochemical/bioprocess engineering.  The  labs were originally
              build 34 years ago for classical wet  chemistry and process research and
              teaching purposes.  None  of this space is now suitable for current needs
              required for  modern biotechnological and bioprocessing research. Research 
              that will be pursued in the renovated lab spaces will  include: 1) production
              of value-added products from  agricultural wastes or byproducts; 2) novel
              bioreactors for  microbial fermentations and cell cultures; 3) ultra 
              filtration of protein and polysaccharides; 4) biodegradation  and
              bioremediation;  and 5) magnetically facilitated cell  separation of cells of 
              biotechnological interest.  This  renovation project will greatly enhance the
              biotechnological  research being done on this campus and make possible better 
              training of the students that are being attracted into these  important areas
              of research.
