Abstract    :
              Lindenberg         This award supports the renovation of space, about 15,444
              square feet, used  for chemistry research at the University of California at
              San Diego.  The renovation  project proposed will allow the collection (into
              one building) of support facilities  for  chemistry which are now scattered
              across the campus.  Such a project will: foster  collaborative research efforts
              that now are impossible in scattered spaces; promote  improved access and
              training for students and postdoctoral fellows; improve efficiency  of research
              and support staff; bring all spaces involved into conformance with modern 
              safety and ADA access codes; and permit better sharing of instruments and
              repair and  maintenance staff.  This facilities modernization project will
              enhance a computational  facility for research and training in chemistry.  It
              will house the NMR  and X-ray  facilities for large and small molecules as well
              as the laser facility.  Finally, it will  house the glass and electronics shops
              that support chemistry research.  This project  will impact about 40 faculty,
              150 chemistry graduate students, and about 60  postdoctoral and visiting
              researchers.  This project will have a major impact on the  efficiency of
              research at this university and will influence research on chemical  materials
              that are important to the nation.
