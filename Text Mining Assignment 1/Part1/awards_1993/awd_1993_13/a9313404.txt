Abstract    :
              9313404  Moon       One of the objectives of the project is to transfer
              knowledge  discovered in the fields of nonlinear dynamics and fractals to 
              applications in material removal processes.  In particular, the  activity will
              focus on the physics of material cutting dynamics and  the relation between
              observed chaotic vibrations in machine tools  and fractal properties of
              workpiece surfaces.  Modern experimental,  computational, and analytical
              methods in dynamical systems and  fractals will be employed on particular
              machine tool systems such  as lathe cutting and milling.  The principal aim of
              the experiments  will be to establish a correlation between cutting tool
              dynamics  and surface quality, especially between chaotic vibrations in the 
              tool motions and fractal or random like properties in the surface  finish. 
              Nonlinear models for cutting tool dynamics will be  investigated both
              analytically and computationally.  These models  will incorporate both time
              delay or regenerative effects as well as  material nonlinearity forces in the
              cutting process.  Of particular  interest will be the search for coexisting
              multiple dynamical  attractors and their basins of attraction.  Experimentally,
              the  goal is to measure the surface roughness both as the material is  being
              removed and in the post dynamics state.          Chatter of  machine tools is a
              critical phenomenon that severely limits their  productivity.  If the chatter
              process can be better understood, the  suppression of unwanted vibration will
              allow machine tools to take  heavier cuts with good surface finish.
