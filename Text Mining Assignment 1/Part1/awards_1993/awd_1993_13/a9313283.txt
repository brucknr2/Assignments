Abstract    :
              9313283  Chakravarthy       Finite capacity queuing systems arise naturally in
              many  practical situations, notably in communications, manufacturing and 
              production systems.  These queuing systems have very few analytical  results
              (most of which are obtained under very stringent conditions  such as
              exponential assumptions) and have been getting a lot of  attention in recent
              years due to their profound applications in  practice.  In this research using
              a dynamic group service rule that  has a number of potential application,
              several finite capacity  queuing models are investigated.  Using matrix
              analytic methods,  these models will be analyzed.         Efficient and stable
              algorithms for computing various system  performance measures will be
              developed.  These algorithms are to be  used interactively to solve
              non-traditional but significant design  problems.  An attempt is made to narrow
              the gap between  theoreticians and practitioners in operations research and 
              production system areas which will be beneficial to industry.
