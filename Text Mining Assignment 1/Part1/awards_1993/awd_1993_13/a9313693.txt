Abstract    :
                Ulrich  9313693    This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Award supports travel 
              expenses of B. Ulrich, Univ. of Michigan, to Salvador  (Bahia), Brazil.  Dr.
              Ulrich will pursue research in  algebra/algebraic geometry, in collaboration
              with A.  Simis, the top Brazilian researcher in the field.  Because the
              research involves a fair amount of computations,  and computational facilities
              at the Univ. of  Bahia are poor  or non-existent, the award also covers funds
              for the  purchase of a McIntosh Powerbook, with the capability for  running
              sophisticated  mathematical software.  The research relates to the properties
              of tangent cones.
