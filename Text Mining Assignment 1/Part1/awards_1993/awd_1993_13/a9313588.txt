              University  Title: Tropical Atmospheric Boundary Layers     Physical and
              dynamical processes the regulate the air-sea exchange  of sensible heat flux,
              water vapor and momentum will be analyzed  using new data sets from the TOGA
              (Tropical Ocean Global  Atmosphere) Program.  The proposed research is intended
              to  contribute to a better understanding of the coupled ocean-  atmosphere
              system and to provide an observational basis for  improving representations of
              the marine atmospheric boundary layer  in dynamical prediction models of the
              atmosphere-ocean system.    The project has two specific objectives:    o   
              determine quantitatively the effect of spatial variations due       to
              mesoscale and synoptic scale disturbances on the large-       scale averaged
              air-sea flux fields of sensible heat, water       vapor and momentum over the
              equatorial Pacific Ocean    o    improve bulk aerodynamic formulas for
              spatially averaged       fluxes including weak wind conditions through analysis
              of       aircraft data from TOGA COARE (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere       Response
              Experiment) and moored buoy data from the TOGA-TAO       (Tropical Ocean
              Atmosphere) array.    This research is important because it seeks to quantify
              the  physical exchange between the warm waters of the western Pacific  Ocean
              and the overlying atmosphere in a highly climate sensitive  region of the
              world.
