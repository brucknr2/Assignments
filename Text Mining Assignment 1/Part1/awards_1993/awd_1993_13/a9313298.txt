Abstract    :
              9313298  Clegg  This award supports the renovation of the laboratories for the
              Curriculum of Applied  Science, a research and research training effort in
              materials science at the University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The
              renovation in progress will modernize 7333  square feet of lab space in two
              buildings, Venable Hall and Phillips Hall.  The  remodeled laboratories are
              essential in order to house modern instrumentation and  train students in the
              most modern technologies necessary for materials research.  The  research to be
              performed in the renovated spaces includes: nonlinear optical studies of 
              materials; materials theory; NMR in solids, and quasicrystals; polymer
              synthesis;  surface spectroscopy; thin film photochemistry; high dielectric
              materials; ion beam  modifications and characterization; and NMR semiconductors
              and insulators.  This  renovation project will have direct impact on the
              research and training environment of  over 20 faculty, and well over 100
              graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral  students.  ***
