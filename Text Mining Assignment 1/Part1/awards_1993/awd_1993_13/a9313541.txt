Abstract    :
              9313541  Daigneau  The University of Rochester will use this award from the NSF
              to repair the environmental   systems and renovate the interiors of constant
              temperature boxes located in Hutchison   Hall, their main biological research
              and teaching facility.  The efforts of the biology faculty   at this
              institution include research and teaching in modern molecular, cellular,  
              developmental and evolutionary biology and ecology, with particular emphasis on
              research   and training in modern molecular genetic techniques.  Most of the
              constant temperature   boxes in this facility are 20 years old and are subject
              to frequent mechanical failure.  Their   deteriorating interiors are poorly lit
              and unappealing to prospective students and faculty.    They are difficult to
              keep clean and free of microorganismal contamination that is   incompatible
              with their use for biochemical experiments, for sterile culture of bacteria,  
              yeast, protozoa and tissue culture.  The repair and renovations planned will
              result in   invaluable savings, not only in reduced energy costs and
              maintenance, but also in direct   costs to research and teaching programs that
              occur when experiments fail and must be   repeated.  This project will affect
              the research and teaching efforts of 19 faculty, 23   postdoctoral level
              researchers, 50 graduate level students and about 50 undergraduate   students
              while enabling the university to more fully support research involving  
              biotechnology.  ***
