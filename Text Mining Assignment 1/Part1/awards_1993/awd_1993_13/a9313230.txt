Abstract    :
                9313230  Myers    This    award    from    the    Chemistry   Research  
              Instrumentation  Program  will   assist  the  Depart-ment  of   Chemistry at
              the California Institute of Tech-nology in the   purchase of a  high resolution
              Mass Spectrometer.  Six  faculty    members whose research  is dependent  upon 
              high resolution mass   spectroscopy will greatly  benefit from  the acquisition
               of this    instrument. Research  projects to  be carried  out with  this  
              instrument include:    1)  Synthetic, structural and mechanistic studies in  
              organotransition metal chemistry,    2)  Sequence specific recognition and
              cleavage of DNA,    3)   Synthesis and characterization large organic molecules
              such   as water-soluble cyclophanes, which are used in host-guest   studies,   
              4)  Organometallic, organic and polymer synthesis and   characterization,    5)
               Chemical studies of protein structure, function and design.    6)  Synthetic
              and mechanistic studies in organic chemistry.    %%%  A high resolution mass
              spectrometer is an instrument used to   measure the precise molecular weight of
              a molecular ion.  This   information is an important piece of data used to help
              determine   the atomic composition and, sometimes, the molecular geometry of a 
               molecule.  It is one of the essential tools needed to learn the   detailed
              structure of  newly synthesized molecules.  ***
