Abstract    :
              Yarus         This award will support the renovation of a 22-year old, 100,000
              square foot  laboratory building that houses the research and research training
              programs of the  Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology
              at the University of  Colorado at Boulder.  This building supports the research
              and training efforts of 27  faculty, 92 research associates and postdoctoral
              fellows, 73 graduate students and 50  undergraduate students.  The renovation
              project in progress will make appropriate this  buildings infrastructure and
              support facilities, consolidate shared central facilities and  upgrade lab
              spaces.   The heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems will be 
              modernized as well as adding new fume hoods and an up-to-date mechanical
              system.   The research to be performed in the renovated spaces ranges from 
              basic nucleic acid  biochemistry to complex developmental events in nematodes,
              flies, and mammalian  cells.  This department is well known for its emphasis on
              model systems that aid in  the solution to major  biological problems.
