Abstract    :
              The U. S. Bureau of the Census will provide SRS a report on                    
              the stock and employment of scientists and engineers in four                   
              countries:  France, United Kingdom, Japan and Canada.  Ellen                   
              Jamison of the Center for International Research of the                        
              Bureau of the Census will derive the numbers from the                          
              population census of each country:  France, 1982 and from                      
              the annual labor force surveys for 1985 through 1992; United                   
              Kingdom, 1981 census and from the annual labor force surveys                   
              for 1986 through 1990; Japan, census samples for 1980, 1985                    
              and 1990; and, Canada, 1986 and 1991 censuses.                                 
                                                                                             
              Ms. Jamison will work with the statistical offices of each                     
              country to obtain special census tabulations when needed.                      
              The report will provide the number of S&E per 1000 of the                      
              labor force and their characteristics:  age, sex, education                    
              and employment by industry group.  This information will be                    
              used in Science and Engineering Indicators and in Science                      
              and Technology International Update for cross country                          
              comparisons of skilled labor force.
