Abstract    :
              9313794  Stephen    Analysis of data from a Vertical Seismic Profile at Ocean
              Drilling  Project site 735B in the Indian Ocean indicates that attenuation in 
              crustal layer 3 may be much higher than previously thought. If this  is true,
              it may indicate that layer 3 is not composed dominantly of  gabbros as is
              commonly thought. The present project will analyze  additional data from
              several different locations in attempting to  clarify the initial results from
              the Indian Ocean.  ***
