Abstract    :
              9313388  Breeden       As the Internet has expanded in recent years, and the
              Congress  has considered and passed legislation that extends and enhances 
              access to the National Research and Education Network (NREN),  public interest
              in networking has skyrocketed.  But its potential  in many publication arenas,
              although sensed by the "early adopters"   in fields such as elementary and
              secondary education and health  care delivery, is not well understood yet.  Who
              is using it?  How  are they using it?  Can we document the benefits?  And what
              is the  case for public investment in the NREN and the national information 
              infrastructure?       The goal of this project is to collect anecdotal
              descriptions  - "stories" -from a range of users about how Internet access has 
              improved their access to information and services.  This collection  of
              "stories" will help document the benefits of the Internet and  will create a
              pools of candidates for further study.  It will also  assist the foundation and
              other Federal Agencies, as well as  legislators, policy makers and Internet
              users, in locating  particular types of users and application.       The
              stories will be made available in one or more Internet  information servers,
              using technologies such as Gopher, WAIS, and  BRS.  They will also be published
              in an illustrated booklet which  will be distributed at no charge to a wide
              audience.  ***
