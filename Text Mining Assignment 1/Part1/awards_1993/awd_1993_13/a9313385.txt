Abstract    :
              Stensel         The problems in environmental engineering and science have
              become broader,  more complex and more sophisticated over the past 10-15 years.
               Water and waste  water treatment issues have been joined by concerns about
              ground water  contamination, sediment contamination, pollution prevention and
              recycle, handling of  toxic and hazardous substances, drinking water quality,
              sludge reclamation and  disposal, nutrient removal and air quality.  Thus,
              environmental engineering problems  are multi media requiring knowledge of the
              behavior of contaminants and their  interaction in air, soil and water.  The
              University of Washington has first class  research and research training
              programs that focus on these environmental engineering  issues.  This award
              will support the renovation of their environmental engineering  laboratories
              which is an area of about 9500 square feet.  The renovation will  reorganize
              lab areas, provide improved ventilation for toxic compounds and reaction 
              studies, improve the heating and air conditioning systems, improve bench tops
              and  cabinets, and provide proper areas for analytical equipment.  This
              renovation project  will impact about 15 faculty and 100 graduate students. 
              Finally, this more modern  facility will add capability and capacity to 
              researchers involved in biotransformation  and bioremediation research,
              research integral to understanding environmental  transformations.
