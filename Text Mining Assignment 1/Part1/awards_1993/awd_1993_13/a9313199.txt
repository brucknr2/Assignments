Abstract    :
              9313199  Farrell  The goal of the proposal is to obtain crystals of the tubulin 
              dimer suitable for X-ray diffraction studies and to use them to  obtain the
              three-dimensional structure of tubulin.  For initial  screens of
              crystallization conditions Dr. Farrell will isolate  chemically homogeneous
              tubulin from a yeast strain we have  constructed which contains a single
              a-tubulin gene and a single  b-tubulin gene.  If necessary, the tubulin genes
              would be further  altered to optimize the chances of obtaining tubulin suitable
              for  crystallization.  Tubulin will be isolated from yeast using a new  method
              that Dr. Farrell has recently developed.  The method  yields approximately 5-10
              mg of pure tubulin from 88L of  fermenter-grown cells.  This method, together
              with the ease of  gene manipulation in yeast, has made it possible for the
              first  time to use gene alteration techniques to assist in obtaining 
              chemically and conformationally homogeneous tubulin for  crystallization.  ***
