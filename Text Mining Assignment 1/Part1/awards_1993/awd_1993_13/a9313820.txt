Abstract    :
              9313820  Neuman  A Surface force microscope equipped with silica surfaces and 
              laser spectroscopic attachments will be used to simultaneously  study the
              tribological properties of molecularly thin liquid  films and the behavior of
              the molecules in the liquid.  The  techniques of sum-frequency generation and
              flourescence recovery  after photobleaching will be used to independently
              measure  molecular orientation, mobility, interacions with the surface,  and
              relaxation.  These properties will be correlated with stick-  slip transitions,
              shear stress and rheology of the thin film.  The liquids to be tested include
              perflouropolyether and n-  hexadecane with and without phisisorbed and
              chemisorbed  additives.  Part of the work will be performed in cooperation 
              with the Swedish Institute for Surface Chemistry in Stockholm.  ***
