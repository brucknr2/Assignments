Abstract    :
              This award will support the DAGS 1993 summer school (June 24-                  
              30, 1993) on parallel programming.  The school will teach                      
              the data parallel language NESL, as well as give tutorials                     
              in the languages C* and High Performance Fortran(HPF).                         
              Attendees for the school are expected from both industry and                   
              academia and will consist of graduate students, junior                         
              faculty, a select number of undergraduates, theoreticians                      
              interested in parallel programming, and scientists from                        
              application areas.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The school follows the DAGS summer symposium on parallel I/O                   
              and databases, two often-neglected, but critically                             
              important, topics. The school on parallel programming will                     
              treat, within a practical context, issues raised during the                    
              symposium.  Students will program and produce homework                         
              solutions with supervision from school faculty.  Students                      
              will also have the benefit of interacting with various                         
              experts during the symposium.
