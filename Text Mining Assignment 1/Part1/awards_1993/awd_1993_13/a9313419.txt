Abstract    :
              Borisy          This award will support the modernization of the Robert Bock
              Laboratory  building at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  This building
              houses the   molecular  biology and molecular virology research activities of
              the campus that  have spun-off world leaders in these fields.  Both research
              and research training  programs take place in this building and the respective
              activities have made  these departments world class.  However, this building
              was built in 1965 and  has not been renovated since it's inception.  The
              renovation to take place will  replace the heating system, the ventilation
              system and fume hoods, the distilled  water supply system, and other mechanical
              support systems that have become  obsolete and worn that now impede the
              over-all research effort and capability.   Finally, this renovation project
              will solve a variety of safety-related issues having  to do with the use of
              hazardous chemicals in fume hoods, the handling and  storage of radioactive
              materials, and current crowing of incompatible operations  in unsuitable
              laboratory spaces.  A total of 163 faculty, postdocs, and students  will be
              impacted by this renovation.  The renovation project underway will  enhance the
              research and training efforts in a strategic research area,  biotechnology.
