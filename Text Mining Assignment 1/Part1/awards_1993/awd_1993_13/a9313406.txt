Abstract    :
               Utilizing NSF support, the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at Southern
              Illinois University will renovate approximately 12,000 square feet of
              laboratory space for the benefit of research and research training activities. 
              NSF funds, combined with matching support from the campus, will reconfigure
              large, poorly designed facilities which reflect the inadequacies of 34 year old
              building design.  Constructed as an instructional facility, the large
              laboratories are inefficient, and many are shared by two researchers.  The hood
              space is limited and is unable to effectively vent toxic fumes.  The vacuum
              systems are weak.  The NSF-supported effort will correct these deficiencies and
              allow for the design of space according to the more specialized needs of seven
              researchers' individual programs.  These programs include studies in analytical
              and organic chemistry with special emphasis in the following specific research
              areas:  synthetic and physical organic chemistry, catalysis, separations theory
              and atomic spectroscopy.
