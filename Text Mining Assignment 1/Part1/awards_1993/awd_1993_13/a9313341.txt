Abstract    :
              9313341  Lupton         This award provides for planning to develop a strategy
              for the  growth of a comprehensive computer science education and research 
              program. The plan includes the incorporation of a new computer  science
              curriculum, and the development of four laboratories:  an  artificial
              intelligence laboratory, a computer graphics laboratory,  a terminal laboratory
              accessing the network and supercomputer, and  a PC workstation laboratory.  ***
