Abstract    :
              9313048  Daverman        A good deal of effort has gone into the recognition
              problem for  topological manifolds.  This is the problem of finding effective
              criteria for  distinguishing manifolds from other, more singular, geometric
              objects.  The  classical implicit function theorem gives one such criterion,
              but even when  this fails and the functions describing the geometric object
              have   singularities, the object itself may nevertheless be a manifold.  A
              compelling  example of this phenomenon is the celebrated Cannon-Edwards
              theorem, which  says that the double suspension of an homology sphere is a
              sphere.        In 1978, Cannon proposed a simple set of criteria for
              recognizing high-  dimensional topological manifolds.  In 1991, Bryant, Ferry,
              Mio, and  Weinberger showed that Cannon's criteria were insufficient.  In fact,
              they  constructed infinitely many distinct families of "noncartesian manifolds"
              -  manifold-like objects satisfying Cannon's criteria which do not have local 
              coordinate descriptions.  The detailed geometry of these spaces is mysterious. 
                     The purpose of the proposed conference is to expose this work to the 
              mathematical public and seek applications of these ideas both within geometric 
              topology and in other areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.  The 
              conference will be very appealing throughout the Southeastern United States, a 
              region which boasts a long tradition of interest in the topic.   ***
