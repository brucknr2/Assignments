Abstract    :
              9313532  Dwelle    This award will provide funding for the renovation of the
              greenhouse and headhouse facilities  at the University of Idaho, the primary
              institution for research and graduate training in the  state.  The departments 
              using the facilities include:  Biology, Bacteriology and  Biochemistry, and
              Plant, Soil and Entomological Sciences.  Although the facilities are 
              structurally sound, numerous inadequacies exist and impede on the research
              activities  conducted, most notably in the areas of genetic engineering and the
              biological control of  organisms.  The greenhouses do not meet federal
              requirements for containment or use of  genetically engineered plants and
              microorganisms,  or for the rearing of exotic biological  control agents.  The
              needed renovations will include improving the HVAC and electrical  systems and
              upgrading the environmental control systems.  In addition,  containment 
              facilities for transgenic plants and exotic biological control agents that meet
              required  specifications,  environmental growth chambers, cold rooms and
              sterilization units will be  provided.  The renovation project will increase
              research productivity in all areas, particularly  in biotechnology-related
              science, and provide scientists with an opportunity to enhance the  quality and
              scope of their research base and graduate student training capabilities.
