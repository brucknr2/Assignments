Abstract    :
              9313979  Oppo  This award will cover partial costs of purchasing an atomic 
              absorption spectrophotometer (remaining costs to be provided by  the
              institution).  The instrument will be devoted to analyses of  Cd in biogenic
              calcite, a technique which shows much promise for  reconstructing former level
              of biologic production and carbon  flux in the deep ocean.  ***
