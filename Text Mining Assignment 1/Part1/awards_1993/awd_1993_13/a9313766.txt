Abstract    :
              9313766  Weber  This is an award to provide support for a  Conference sponsored
              by the Association of  Environmental Engineering Professors, results  of which
              are expected to provide guidance to  the Environmental and Ocean Systems
              Program  in planning and support of research.  The specific topics to be
              considered in this  conference include pollution prevention,  remediation of
              contaminated soil and   innovative processes for destruction of  organic
              substances of pollutional  significance.    This conference sponsored by the
              Association  of Environmental Engineering Professors, will  be co-chaired by
              Dr. Walter J. Weber, Jr. of  the University of Michigan and Dr. James H. 
              Johnson, Jr. of Howard University.  It will  be held at the University of
              Michigan in Ann  Arbor from September 20-22, 1993 and is being  jointly
              supported by the National Science  Foundation and the Environmental Protection 
              Agency.
