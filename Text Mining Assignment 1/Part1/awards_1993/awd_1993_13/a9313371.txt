Abstract    :
                  9313371  Blakely         Basic studies of materials growth and processing-- 
              surface  diffusion, step interactions, epitaxy--will be conducted to 
              understand and control surface structural defects and the  kinetics of surface
              morphological and compositional changes  in  the crystal growth of silicon,
              germanium, and strained layer  alloy thin films; STM in combination with
              electron(LEED) and  X-  Ray diffraction will be used to provide full 
              characterization of  surface morphology as well as to study the dynamics of
              step  rearrangement during growth.  Patterned substrates are  developed  and
              used as a way to control the distribution of steps which  allows an entire
              distribution of step densities to be  studied  simultaneously instead of having
              to use multiple samples.  Samples with a distribution of step densities also
              have  positive  practical implications with respect to preventing and/or 
              controlling three-dimensional nucleation and growth.  %%%  The primary goal of
              this program is to develop a fundamental  understanding of surface diffusion,
              and elementary features  of  epitaxial growth and related processing of
              germanium and  silicon.  An important feature of the program is the education
              and  training  of students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant 
              area of materials science and engineering.  This research  will  contribute to
              improving the general performance of advanced  devices and integrated circuits
              used in computing,  information  processing, and telecommunications.  ***
