Abstract    :
              This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is                 
              made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Ingrid Fritsch-Faules of                 
              the Chemistry Department, University of Arkansas.  The long                    
              term goal of the research is to prepare three-dimensional                      
              electrode devices with submicron features with controlled                      
              surface characteristics.  Electrochemical and molecular                        
              self-assembly techniques will be used to tailor the electrode                  
              surfaces for various applications, and to characterize the                     
              operation of the device.  During the planning period, the                      
              fabrication approach would be developed, including proof of                    
              principle experiments using thin film layering and patterning                  
              methods.  These devices may find application as multifunctional                
              electrochemical sensors or miniature electrochemical filter                    
              devices useful in analytical chemistry.
