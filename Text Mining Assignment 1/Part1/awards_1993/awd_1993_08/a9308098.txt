Abstract    :
              Torrellas         This research aims at improving the performance of memory 
              hierarchies in scalable shared-memory multiprocessors.  The  research uses
              advanced performance monitoring hardware to  characterize the performance of a
              real scalable machine, namely  the 32-processor Cedar machine developed at the
              University of  Illinois.  Data from the characterization is being generalized
              to  other machines, and optimizations such as new algorithms or  hardware
              support are being evaluated.         The research focuses on four research
              issues in memory  hierarchies:  1.     the performance of cache memories and
              prefetch buffers under  frequent vector and block traffic;  2.     the
              performance of Omega interconnection networks connecting  the fastest layers of
              the memory hierarchy to global memory;  3.     dynamic page migration and
              replication in the memory  hierarchy to increase data locality; and  4.     the
              cache memory performance of the operating system.
