Abstract    :
              9308407  Lee  This project is on research to  increase the foreign gene
              expression  level in plant cell cultures.  This  involves studying the cellular
              and  environmental parameters influencing  the efficient production of 
              mammalian proteins in suspension  plant cell cultures and obtaining  stronger
              promoter systems than those  currently available.  Also, an  understanding of
              how different  properties of mammalian proteins  affect the efficiency of gene 
              expression in plant cell cultures  will be pursued.  To facilitate this  last
              objective, the proteins in this  study include monoclonal antibodies,  bovine
              lysozyme, human interleukin 6  (IL- 6), and the Tac subunit of the  interleukin
              2 receptor protein (IL -  2R).  In addition to having  different structural and
              biochemical  properties, these products all have  important applications in
              medicine  and biotechnology.  ***
