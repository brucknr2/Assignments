Abstract    :
              9308604  COMAROFF  This project will examine the impact of European Community
              (EC) law  on the development of new patterns of local/regional politics 
              operating inside and outside member-states' national borders.   Focusing on the
              British Kent and French Calais Transmanche  Euroregion (1990), the investigator
              will conduct primary fieldwork  in Kent.  The main objective is to present an
              analytical  ethnography of how local attitudes and allegiances to Britain have 
              shifted in Kent over the past five years, overcoming strong British 
              nationalism, and resulting in the region's joining with Calais as  a new
              trans-border territory of Europe sanctioned by EC law.  This  project will make
              an important contribution to scientific  understanding of processes of
              sociolegal change.    The investigator will use observational methods and
              conduct in-  depth interviews in Kent.  The project will also require analysis 
              of legal and policy documentation for the period.  The result will  be a
              thorough description and analysis of how a shared  (transnational) legal system
              is used as both a technical tool to  bring about change and an ideological
              framework to mediate  processes of political, economic and cultural
              affiliation.  ***
