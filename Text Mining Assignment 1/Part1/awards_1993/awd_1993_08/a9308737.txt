Abstract    :
              9308737  Holloway  In this project, automated procedures are developed for 
              synthesizing distributed discrete-event control laws according to 
              specifications of operations sequencing and forbidden state  avoidance.  The
              framework considered consists of a manufacturing  system modeled as a
              controlled Petri net, a set of distributed  controllers, and a communication
              channel through which the  controllers interact.  The distributed
              representation of the  system state as a Petri net marking offers distinct
              advantages in  the modeling of distributed systems and in developing efficient 
              synthesis procedures.  The developed synthesis techniques are  enhanced to
              optimize the permissiveness of the control while  minimizing the controller
              interaction.  The techniques drawn upon  recent results in discrete-event
              control theory for both automata  system models and Petri net system models. 
              Finally, the  strengths and weaknesses of the discrete-event control synthesis 
              are demonstrated by implementing and evaluating the synthesized  control in an
              automated manufacturing facility.  ***
