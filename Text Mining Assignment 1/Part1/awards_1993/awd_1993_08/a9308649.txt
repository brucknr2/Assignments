Abstract    :
                Visual  programming  languages (VPLs) offer the  hope  of  higher  reliability
              at lower labor costs, but only if they can be  scaled  up  for 
              realistically-sized  programming  projects.  This research  addresses  a 
              critical  factor  in  scaling   up  declarative  VPLs, by  developing an
              interactive  and  visual  yet  powerful  approach to data  abstraction. The
              visual approach  adds  expressive  power  to VPLs through  simplicity,  rather 
              than  the  traditional  approach  of  providing  them  at  the  expense   of 
              simplicity.  The  concepts developed are being  implemented  in  a  research  
              declarative  VPL  and  made  available  to  interested  researchers.    This
              work builds upon recent work in data abstraction,  event-  handling,  and  the
              scaling-up problem. Visual  design  issues are addressed,  and  the  current 
              implementation is being prepared to serve as  a  base  research  system.  The
              research seeks the  incorporation of a visual and  flexible approach to code
              reuse. At  the  same time, a simple approach to  exception handling based  on 
              the  earlier  work on events is being developed.  Additional  work  regarding 
              visual impact and visual support for the  approach  to  data abstraction is
              expected to enhance the simplicity and effectiveness of  the  results.
