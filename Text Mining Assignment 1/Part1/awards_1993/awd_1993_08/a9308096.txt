Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided to help cover costs for the participation                   
              of U.S. researchers in the fifth Engineering Foundation                        
              International Conference on Separation Technology to be held                   
              in Holland.  The focus of this 5 day conference is on issues                   
              and problems of current interest and importance in                             
              separations.  Topic areas of emphasis of the program will be                   
              on adsorption processes, crystallization, extraction,                          
              membrane-based methods, property prediction and process                        
              design.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Separations technology affects the quality of life of American                 
              citizens in many ways including consumer costs, toxic waste                    
              reduction and environmental cleanup, and energy requirements                   
              for industrial production.  Advances in separation methods can                 
              make domestic firms more competitive while reducing the burden                 
              on the environment.
