Abstract    :
              Executable specification is regarded as an important                           
              supporting tool for software system design, because it                         
              integrates the method of formal analysis, and the more                         
              experimental approach of prototyping and testing to analyze                    
              and to verify the design of a system at early stage of the                     
              software life cycle.  However, executable specification is                     
              still a virgin area in OO research. The motivation of this                     
              research is to bridge this important technological gap in                      
              the current OO research.  An executable design specification                   
              language for OO systems will be studied. The language is                       
              called extended G-Nets (eG-Nets), which is based on the                        
              theory of Petri nets, and the PI's previous work on the G-                     
              Net framework.  The design of eG-Nets represents a modular                     
              approach for software specifications in the sense that an eG-                  
              Net specification not only specifies the behavior of an OO                     
              system, but also the structure of the design.  EG-Net                          
              specifications are directly executable in distributed                          
              environment.
