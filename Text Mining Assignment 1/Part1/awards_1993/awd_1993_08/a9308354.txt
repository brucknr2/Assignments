Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Kenneth B. Wiberg at Yale University              
              to study effects of structural changes and of substituent effects              
              on the properties of small ring compounds. The focal point of the              
              combined experimental and theoretical approach is the advancement              
              of the understanding of the nature of the carbon-carbon bond.                  
              Ionic, free radical, and thermal reactivities of strained                      
              hydrocarbons will be studied by means of synthetic methodologies,              
              spectroscopic analyses, and quantum mechanical approaches.                     
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project Dr. Kenneth Wiberg will conduct synthetic,                     
              spectroscopic, and computational studies to examine how both                   
              substituents and structural strain effect the properties of small              
              ring hydrocarbons. This multifaced approach aims to advance the                
              knowledge of carbon-carbon bonding, thereby providing fundamental              
              thermodynamic, kinetic, as well as electronic information for                  
              this important class of compounds.
