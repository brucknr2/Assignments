Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT --- CTS-9308708  This proposal deals with the application of analytical
              and numerical techniques to the SHS process in hybrid systems (gas-solid). 
              Model development will be carried out incorporating complex chemistry and
              melting in those systems in which simultaneous synthesis and densification can
              take place.  The emphasis is on reaction mechanisms and changes in density
              resulting from combustion.
