              ABSTRACT       This project involves development of a new method of synthesis 
              for the commercial production of surfactants.  Aqueous solution of  surfactant
              will be used to dissolve the hydrophobic starting  material in micelles and to
              facilitate chemical conversion by  micellar catalysis.  Product surfactant
              should form additional  micelles to autocatalyze the process.     Surfactants
              are a very important group of chemicals used in soap  and detergent cleaners,
              medicines, food, and many health and beauty  products.  By eliminating the need
              for organic solvents, the  environmental burden from the preparation of these
              compounds will  be reduced.
