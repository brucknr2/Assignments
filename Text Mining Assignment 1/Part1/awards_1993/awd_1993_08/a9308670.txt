Abstract    :
              9308670 Martin The specific aims of this proposal are to test and to further
              refine an emerging structural model for promoter recognition and to extend that
              model to include mechanistic detail regarding the early stages of
              transcription.  The incorporation of functional group substitutions in the
              protein allow detailed probing of critical protein-DNA interactions in 3 areas
              of the promoter: a proposed duplex recognition domain upstream, a single
              stranded region near the start site, and the poorly understood transition
              region in between.  A variety of approaches will be applied to this system to
              complement well-established kinetic studies and to provide a better
              understanding of the chemical nature of specific interactions.  Titration
              microcalorimetry will be developed to probe protein - DNA binding interactions
              in more detail.  Specific chemical incorporation of nonperturbing
              photoactivatable nucleotides into promoter DNA will provide much needed
              direction to further protein mutagenesis studies. %%%% The goal of this
              research is to understand the enzymology of transcription, including the
              chemical basis of transcript initiation.  The T7 family of RNA polymerses
              present an ideal model system in which to study not only the fundamental
              aspects of sequence-specific macromolecular interactions, but also the basic
              mechanisms of polymerases.  The effects of simple chemical modifications in the
              DNA and the protein will be determined, in order to refine our understanding of
              the recognition interface. ****
