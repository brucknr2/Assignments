Abstract    :
              9308879  Carter  The  objective of this project is to develop a novel 
              programming  environment for distributed memory multiprocessors that  provides 
              efficient  support  for  both  the  data  shipping  and  function  shipping  
              programming  paradigms.  This   is   accomplished   by  integrating  a 
              distributed  shared memory  (DSM)  system,  which  provides transparent data
              shipping, with a remote procedure  call  (RPC) system, which supports
              distributed function shipping.  This  integration   addresses  the  most 
              serious  problems   of   both  paradigms.  DSM enables processes to share data
              across processors  that  only  communicate via message passing, but experience 
              with  the  Munin  DSM system indicates that it is often inefficient  to 
              require   all  communications  to  occur  through  shared   data.  Conversely,
              in conventional RPC systems, it is difficult to  pass  complex  data 
              structures  that use  arbitrary  pointers  because  clients  and servers reside
              within distinct address spaces.  This  seriously  restricts the programming
              model. Supporting  a  shared  address  space allows arbitrarily complex data
              structures  to  be  passed as part of an RPC,. Preliminary results indicate
              that  the  combination  of  data  and  function shipping  can  significantly 
              improve the performance of DSM and improve the programmability of  RPC.   The 
              project  also  involves  the  development  of  simple  performance monitoring
              and visualization tools to ease  the  task  of programming such a system.  ***
