Abstract    :
              9308854  Kevan    The goal of the proposed research is to apply a variant of 
              molecular beam epitaxy called van der Waals epitaxy to synthesize  novel
              compounds and superlattices based upon transition metal  phosphochalcogenide
              (MPX3) compounds.  The primary motivation to  pursue this area is a qualitative
              similarity to the high  temperature cuprate superconductors.  Alternative high
              Tc materials  will thus be sought.  The currently known transition metal MPX3 
              compounds are all correlated antiferromagnetic insulaators and have  a
              quasi-two-dimensional layered structure similar to MX2 compounds.   The
              synthetic flexibility allowed by vapor phase epitaxy will allow  systematic
              variation of effective one-electron band widths and  effective on-site
              correlation energies to induce an insulator-metal  transition, thereby
              producing materials with novel and potentially  useful transport, optical, and
              magnetic properties.  Specifically,  i) the number of known MPX3 compounds will
              be increased to include  4d and 5d metals, ii) random alloys  M'yM1-yPX3  will
              be grown to  induce n- or p-type doping, and iii) superlattices combining MPX3 
              compounds with a variety of layered maaaaterials having divergent  dielectric
              properties will be produced.  These new materials and  structures will be
              characterized by a variety of techniques.  ***
