Abstract    :
              This Career Advnacement Award for Women is made in the                         
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program                  
              to Dr. Susan C. Jackels of the Chemistry Department, Wake                      
              Forest University.  The long-term goal of the project is to use                
              computational molecular modeling as a tool for the design of                   
              chelating ligands.  Large chelating ligands can surround and                   
              immobilize, that is, sequester metal ions and are useful in                    
              environmental applications for extracting metal ions, including                
              radioactive ones, from solution and concentrating them for                     
              other uses.  By designing chelating ligands for particular                     
              conditions, they may be more effective in separating specific                  
              metals.  They also have potential in development of                            
              metal-containing radiopharmaceuticals for imaging and for                      
              therapy.  Dr. Jackels has synthesized and characterized ligands                
              of this sort in the past and will through this project add                     
              molecular modeling expertise to her repetoire of tools that can                
              be used for design and evaluation of their effectiveness.  This                
              award will enable her to collaborate with computational experts                
              at the University of Minnesota and at Battelle Northwest.
