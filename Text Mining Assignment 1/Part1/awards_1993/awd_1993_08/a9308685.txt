Abstract    :
              The goals of this research is to utilize the Cro protein-operator              
              system of bacteriophage Lambda to develop an 15N nuclear magnetic              
              resonance method for studying DNA-protein interactions.  15N                   
              labeled A, T, C, and G nucleotide derivatives which can be used                
              in the normal phosphoramidite chemistry for synthesizing                       
              oligomers of DNA will be prepared.  Complementary double strand                
              17-mers containing one AT or one GC base pair enriched with 15N                
              (>90%) will be synthesized.  15N NMR resonances are very                       
              sensitive to hydrogen bonding.  Thus, when the protein binds to                
              the DNA with formation of hydrogen bonds between the N-atoms of                
              the bases and the amino acid side chains, the resonances from                  
              individual N atoms will undergo shifts.  In this way, the                      
              specific atoms of the bases in the DNA which are interacting with              
              the protein will be mapped.  The method will be generalized to                 
              predict the nature of DNA/protein interactions involving proteins              
              of unknown structure.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              DNA-protein interactions are central to control of all aspects of              
              the life of the cell.  Nevertheless, short of X-ray                            
              crystallography, contemporary biologists have few tools with                   
              which to study the details of these important interactions.  The               
              work proposed involves use of stable 15N isotope-substituted DNA               
              molecules and nuclear magnetic resonance to provide detailed                   
              information about the interactions between proteins and DNA.                   
              Such studies may lead a rapid means for obtaining unprecedentedly              
              detailed information about such interactions.
