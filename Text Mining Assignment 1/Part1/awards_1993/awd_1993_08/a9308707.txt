Abstract    :
              9308707  Robinson  The research entails a study of representations of Clifford 
              algebras on Hilbert spaces within a geometric context.  Links  with reduction
              methods in symplectic geometry and geometric  quantization are expected. 
              Transferences between phase spaces  and the generalized theory of the harmonic
              oscillator will be  studied in view of symplectic group actions.  The research
              is  likely to have significant applications to modern quantum field  theory and
              Hamiltonian mechanics.
