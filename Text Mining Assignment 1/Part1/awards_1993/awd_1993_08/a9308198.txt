Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research involves a molecular approach to studying the                    
              mechanism for peripheral T cell tolerance.  Exposure of T                      
              lymphocytes to tolerogen in vitro or in vivo inhibits the antigen-             
              specific proliferative capacity of T helper (Th) type 1 (Th1)                  
              cells, but not Th type 2 (Th2) cells.  A possible mechanism for T              
              cell anergy involves the inappropriate expression or activation of             
              cyclins, highly conserved cell cycle regulatory proteins.  The                 
              first objective to test this possibility is to characterize cyclin             
              use during cell cycle progression of non-tolerized murine Th1 and              
              Th2 clones.  Immunoblotting techniques and H1 histone kinase assays            
              will be used to study the levels and/or activation states of a                 
              panel of cyclin mRNAs, cyclin proteins and cyclin-CDK complexes in             
              resting and antigen-activated Th cells.  The second objective is to            
              examine the effects of tolerance induction on normal Th1 and Th2               
              cell cyclin use.  Since little is known about cyclin use in                    
              mammalian lymphocytes, the results of the experiments described                
              here will be novel, and potentially useful in delineating T cell               
              activation and anergy.

              The planning activities to be supported by this grant will give the            
              investigator, whose background is in cellular immunology,                      
              experience in methods of molecular biology so that she can pursue              
              studies of the molecular basis of the phenomenon of T cell                     
              tolerance in immune function.
