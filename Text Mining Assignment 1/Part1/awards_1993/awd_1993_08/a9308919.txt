Abstract    :
              Shynk         This research is developing nonlinear adaptive algorithms  for the
              detection of cochannel signals transmitted over time-  varying channels.  These
              algorithms directly estimate both  channels, and the results are used to
              perform joint sequence  estimation or joint symbol detection.  At least two
              performance  criteria are being considered, including maximum likelihood 
              sequence estimation and maximum a posteriori symbol detection.   The focus will
              be on applications where the channels are rapidly  time-varying and the data
              are transmitted in short bursts.  Dual-  mode adaptive algorithms that combine
              fast training with blind  equalization/tracking for cochannel signal detection
              are also  being developed.  These algorithms will be designed to have a 
              superior symbol error rate performance compared to conventional  interference
              cancellation techniques.
