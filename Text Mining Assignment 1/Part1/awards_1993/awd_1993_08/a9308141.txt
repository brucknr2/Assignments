Abstract    :
                   PI will examine, by various techniques, the internal structure            
              of exceptionally well-preserved specimens of certain Paleozoic                 
              calcareous green algae (Chlorophyta), commonly known as phylloid               
              algae.  These organisms were important carbonate producers in Late             
              Paleozoic times, but as yet their structure and taxonomy are not               
              well understood.  This study will test the utility of several                  
              techniques and should contribute to a better understanding of the              
              Chlorophyta, allowing comparisons with other Paleozoic collections             
              and with presumed living relatives, especially Halimeda.
