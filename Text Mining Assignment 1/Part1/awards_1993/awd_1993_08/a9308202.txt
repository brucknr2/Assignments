Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the purchase of five                  
              Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers whose use in the field               
              will be shared between the Principal Investigator and colleagues               
              at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and members of the                
              University UNAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO). MIT is committed to                   
              providing the remaining funds necessary for this acquisition, and              
              the UNAVCO consortium is committed to providing maintenance and                
              repair for the GPS receivers.                                                  
                   Since its introduction in the mid-1980s, GPS surveying has                
              become an indispensable tool for the study of present-day regional             
              tectonics. The ability to measure directly, with accuracy of a few             
              millimeters per year, motions of the earth's crust over large                  
              distances allows direct observation of lithosphere plate motions,              
              mountain building, and local deformations due to earthquakes and               
              volcanos. The MIT group and the UNAVCO consortium will use the new             
              receivers in a program of field campaigns aimed at a better                    
              understanding of present-day crustal deformation processes.
