Abstract    :
              9308054  Melton  A relationship between nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and a 
              peripheral membrane protein designated the 43K protein has been  described. 
              Aggregation of these receptors in the postsynaptic  membrane is an early and
              crucial step in synapse formation.  In   neuromuscular synapses in the
              peripheral nervous system, the 43K  protein is known to play a major role in
              clustering and anchoring  the receptors at the postsynaptic site.  The
              applicant will  attempt to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which these receptors 
              aggregate early in the development of synapses in the central  nervous system,
              and characterize the role of the 43K protein, or  homologue.  This work will be
              conducted in the laboratory of   Dr. Stanley Froehner at the University of
              North Carolina School  of Medicine..  ***
