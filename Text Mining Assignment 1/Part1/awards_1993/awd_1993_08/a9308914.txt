Abstract    :
                  9308914  Stahl    The purpose of this proposed research is to develop
              alternative  theories of strategic thinking, design experiments to test the 
              theories, and statistically analyze the experimental data to  answer the
              following questions:       -  Is it possible to detect different modes of
              strategic       thinking in an apparently homogeneous population of      
              experimental subjects, thereby rejecting the hypothesis of a       common mode
              of strategic thinking?       -  Assuming that no experimental subject is
              precisely one of       the theoretical types, how much diversity within each   
                 categorical type is due to (a) small variations in priors       and (b)
              computational errors by subjects?       -  If subjects are given aggregate
              information about the       past choices of the population, how will the
              various types       incorporate that information?  The results of this research
              should make important contributions  to our understanding of individual
              strategic decision making and  multi-decision-maker problems.  ***
