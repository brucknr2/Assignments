Abstract    :
               This research studies a new model of computation, which  extends  the
              object-oriented model with timing constraints  and resource  requirements 
              specifications.  A  set of scenarios (a set of applications  executing at a
              time)  and a scenario change  mechanism that allows for  different sets of
              applications to be  executed according to  the situation are defined.  These
              scenario changes are triggered by  an error handler, by an operator or  by a
              user.  Scenario  changes also allow uniformity in multiple types of  
              fault-tolerant behavior such as graceful degradation, load-shedding,  etc..   
              The latency of these scenario  changes and quantify their  applicability to
              real-time and  non-real-time systems are studied.  Methods are  developed for
              the  detection of situations in which these scenario changes can  be applied,
              and develop a theory for the adaptation of these  scenario changes  to
              non-time-constrained applications and  systems.  More accurate models are 
              developed based on  real-life  workloads and situations, to model realistic 
              fault models,  encompassing transient as well as permanent  faults.  These are 
              of temporal or physical nature (e.g.,  transient overloads, site  crashes or 
              link failures).   The  implementation of a prototype of a fault-tolerant  
              real-time  system that  supports this model of computation follows.
