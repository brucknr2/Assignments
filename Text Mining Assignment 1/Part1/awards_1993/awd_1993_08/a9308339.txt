Abstract    :
                      9308339  Papadopoulos  This research will address certain novel
              variational formulations  of boundary- and initial-value problems in contact
              mechanics, which  are amenable to discrete approximation by finite element
              methods.   The context of the analysis is set to encompass problems involving 
              contacting bodies that may undergo arbitrarily large motions and  deformations.
