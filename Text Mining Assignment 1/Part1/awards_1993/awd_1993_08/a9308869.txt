Abstract    :
              Researchers have long realized that many workers find jobs                     
              through friends and relatives.  Survey evidence suggests that                  
              about half of all workers found their jobs through personal                    
              contacts.  Both sides of the labor market-- workers and firms--                
              appear to benefit from the use of employee referrals.  The                     
              widespread use of referrals by workers and firms suggests that                 
              social structure--the pattern of social ties connecting                        
              individuals--may play an important role in determining labor-                  
              market outcomes.  In particular, inbreeding bias (the prevalence               
              of intra-group ties) and triad bias (the prevalence of cliques)                
              in social networks may reduce labor-market efficiency and                      
              increase inequality.  The purpose of this project is to analyze                
              the implications of these network biases.  Among the questions to              
              be addressed are:  (1) How do changes in these social structures               
              affect labor market outcomes?  (2) What is the equilibrium                     
              relationship among job-search method, network structure, wages,                
              and employment?   Of special interest is whether social network                
              explanations of labor market inequality are consistent with                    
              observed correlations in labor force micro data.  The project is               
              important because it may help us to better understand why there                
              are persistent racial and gender differences with respect to                   
              wages and other labor market outcomes.
