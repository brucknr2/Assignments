Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This  is  an  award under the Research Planning  Grant                   
              program for women scientists and engineers.  It is a project                   
              to   study  the  changing  shape  of  voluntary  association                   
              activism in America in recent decades.  The researcher  will                   
              examine   Internal   Revenue  Service  data   on   voluntary                   
              associations in order to select a representative  sample  of                   
              such   associations  and  identify  their  founders.    Also                   
              supported would be work to develop an interview schedule and                   
              pilot   interviews  with  selected  founders  of   voluntary                   
              associations  in order to learn their what their  strategies                   
              were  in launching their organizations and how they saw  the                   
              environment for activism at that time.                                         
                    This award will initiate research which should provide                   
              important  new  perspectives  on  the  social  climate   and                   
              political  dynamics  of  post-World  War  II  America.    In                   
              addition  to  the  scientific gains to be  achieved  by  the                   
              research,  this  award will materially  assist  a  promising                   
              young  researcher  to prepare for a larger project,  thereby                   
              contributing  to  the stengthening of the national  base  of                   
              women scientists and engineers.
