Abstract    :
              9308583  Strauss  Professor Strauss, of Colorado State University, will continue
               to investigate weakly coordinating anions with funding from the  Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program.  New target anions will be
              polyfluorinated species such as   Sb(OTeF5)6 -,  Sb(OC(CF3)3)6 -, and analogous
              anions having  Ti4+ and other cations as central atoms.  Stable salts of these 
              anions will be prepared, characterized, and used to isolate  unusually reactive
              cations.  This will impact studies of  coordination complexes having very
              weakly coordinated ligands  (such as chloroalkanes), and it may help generate
              new  homogeneous catalysts.  Other target cations include silyl  cations, 
              Fe(por) +, and  Zr(Cp)2(Me) +.  A fourth area will be  the preparation of
              carbonyl complexes of the coinage group  metal cations.  %%%  Molecules that
              have a positive charge are called "cations".  When complex cations are
              constructed by bonding atoms or groups  of atoms to a central metal atom, this
              atom usually has a  preferred number of other atoms strongly bonded to it. 
              However, when these cations participate in chemical reactions  they can exist
              briefly with either a reduced number of bound  atoms or else with one bound
              quite weakly;  these unusual  states are crucial to the reactions, but they are
              difficult to  examine because of their instability.  Experiments to alleviate 
              these difficulties will be performed by preparing specially  unreactive anions,
              negatively charged species which are  required in order to balance the charge
              of the cations.  It is  anticipated that these new anions will permit
              preparation of  highly reactive cations that will elucidate fundamental 
              chemistry and perhaps serve as new industrial catalysts.  ***
