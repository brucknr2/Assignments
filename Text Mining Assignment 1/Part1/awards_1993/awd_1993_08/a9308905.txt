Abstract    :
              9308905  Fuster    When one wants to remember a piece of information like a
              telephone  number for 20 seconds or so, one uses a memory process called 
              active or working memory. This working memory resembles a mental  scratchpad.
              When the information has been used to dial the phone,  the scratchpad is erased
              and the information is gone. If the number  was dialed incorrectly, it has to
              be looked up again because no  trace remains. Thus this memory process differs
              from that used in  long term memory where the trace remains permanently.
              Neurons in  the cerebral cortex fire actively during the interval that the 
              information is "kept in mind." With this NSF grant, Dr. Fuster a  pioneer in
              the study of biological memory, will use multielectrode  arrays to record from
              active memory cells and correlate the  activity of neighboring cells when
              memories are being kept in mind  and when they are erased. He will compare
              these correlations to  those simulated by an artificial neural network, in
              order to  elucidate the cortical architecture and connectivity that is 
              necessary to provide such a memory capability. The results will  improve our
              understanding of biological memory and our ability to  design artificial
              circuits that remember and adapt.***
