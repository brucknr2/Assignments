Abstract    :
              Predictability - the ability to foretell that an                               
              implementation will not violate a set of specified                             
              requirements - is a crucial, highly desirable property of                      
              embedded systems.  This research aims at developing a                          
              programming environment (language, libraries, and tools) for                   
              building predictable time-critical systems.                                    
                                                                                             
              The backbone of the environment is CLEOPATRA, a programming                    
              language that is demonstrably well-suited for the                              
              requirements of embedded systems.  CLEOPATRA features a C-                     
              like imperative syntax for the description of computation,                     
              which makes it easier to incorporate in applications already                   
              using C.  It is event-driven, and thus appropriate for                         
              embedded process control applications. It is object-oriented                   
              and compositional, thus advocating modularity and                              
              reusability.  CLEOPATRA is semantically sound; its objects                     
              can be transformed, mechanically and unambiguously, into                       
              formal TRA automata for verification purposes, which can be                    
              pursued using model-checking or theorem providing                              
              techniques. Since 1989, an ancestor of CLEOPATRA has been in                   
              use as a specification and simulation language for embedded                    
              time-critical robotic processes.  The goal of this research                    
              goes one step further.  It aims at building an integrated                      
              CLEOPATRA-based support environment that would be useful for                   
              real-time system developers, both in academia and in                           
              industry.
