Abstract    :
              9308804  Currie    Selection of particular motor patterns is a complex process
              that  depends on the integration of sensory information with information  about
              internal state. Both spatial and temporal integration of  information by
              specialized interneurons is required for appropriate  pattern selection. This
              NSF award to a new young investigator is to  establish a novel model system for
              the study of this phenomenon.  The behavior involved is a particular form of
              the scratch reflex in  which a brief stimulus sets up a pattern of excitation
              that far  outlasts the stimulus. Dr. Currie will investigate the 
              pharmacological and physiological mechanisms that spinal  interneurons use to
              "remember" the stimulus. For these experiments  he will utilize a newly
              developed enzyme-treated carbon-fiber  microelectrode that can detect the
              release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate with exquisite temporal
              (millisecond) resolution. The  results of these investigations will aid in our
              understanding of  human motor control and spinal cord function.  ***
