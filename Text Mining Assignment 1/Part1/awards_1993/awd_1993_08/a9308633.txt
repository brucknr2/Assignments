Abstract    :
              9308633  Ostrom    This is a follow-up conference to one that was held at
              Harvard in  April of 1992.  The conference will bring together scholars from 
              many diverse disciplines working on problems related to both global  and local
              environmental issues who rarely have an opportunity to  confront one another's
              work.  Even so, there has been a remarkable  convergence between two
              independent streams of literature in  political science, economics,
              international relations,  anthropology, ecology, and related disciplines.  The
              convergence  points to important similarities between the cooperation achieved 
              in some international regimes and in some local common-pool  resources (CPRs). 
                The major activity of this conference is to further theoretical and 
              empirical work on six unresolved, theoretical issues at the core of  research
              on international regimes as well as on CPRs.  These issues  are well defined
              but not yet effectively addressed and are thus  ripe for further work in the
              immediate future.  These issues are  crucially important to the understanding
              of cooperation in  situations of collective action without hierarchical
              governance.    The set of activities contributes to the scientific
              investigation  of a theory of cooperation related to environmental issues at
              both  the global and local level.  In the current era of global change,  the
              research leads to important policy recommendations emphasizing  the importance
              of multiple scales of organization.
