Abstract    :
              9308495  Campbell       The pace of recent colonization of the Brazilian Amazon 
              has provoked concern over losses of large areas of tropical  primary forest as
              well as the uncertain prospect of  establishing sustainable agricultural
              systems in this  region.  Effective policies for managing development of such 
              regions depend upon a clear and detailed understanding of  how colonists have
              used the landscape and how their uses  change over time.  Previous studies have
              examined  deforestation in such regions by means of satellite  overviews, often
              without the benefit of field data.  This  study applies multispectral remote
              sensing data to identify  land use patterns in a recently colonized region of 
              Rondonia, Brazil.  It performs a detailed examination of  land use on a
              lot-by-lot, field-by-field basis for the  period 1986 to 1992.  It will focus
              on changes in forested  area and upon land uses that have replaced forested
              areas  during colonization.  Through analysis of changes in land  cover the
              research will isolate those biologic, social, and  economic processes which
              contribute to deforestation.  Of  particular interest is the regrowth of forest
              after  abandonment of economic activity, and how the differences  between
              primary and secondary growth forest can be  determined through spectral images
              from satellite data.       Research on global change includes not only analysis
              of  ways in which human activity modifies physical environments,  but also the
              speed and character of regeneration of natural  systems.  This research
              project, combining use of remotely  sensed data with ground observations and
              social surveys,  will enhance understanding of the role of human activity in 
              the complex processes of deforestation and forest  regeneration in ecologically
              senstive areas of the world.  ***
