Abstract    :
              This research will establish the basic relationships arising in                
              composite and other multiphase materials with sharp-corner                     
              inclusions in the temperature and stress fields.  In the process of            
              deformation and heating of multiphase materials, contacting bodies             
              may not necessarily remain in full contact.  They may locally                  
              separate or have imperfect contact as heat is conducted through the            
              interface.  Moreover, microcracks can emerge from a sharp corner of            
              the inclusions.
