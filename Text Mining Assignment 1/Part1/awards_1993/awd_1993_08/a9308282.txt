Abstract    :
              Yuzhuo Li  9308282    The objective of this work is to use heterogenous
              semiconductor  systems for photocatalytic organic synthesis.  Emphasis is on 
              intermediates useful in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, polymer,  and dye
              industries.  Reactor configurations that are energy  efficient and cost
              effective are designed and new semiconductor  systems are tested.  Specific
              tasks include applications of  photocatalytic reduction (using titania
              photocatalyst) to  aldehydes, azides, nitrites, and nitro compounds;
              photocatalytic  fixation of carbon dioxide into aromatic compounds on
              semiconductor  surfaces; preparation of monodispersed particles with a core of 
              tungsten trioxide coated with ferric oxide and evaluation of their 
              photocatalytic potential in redox reactions; preparation of  monodispersed
              titania coated with conducting polymers and  evaluation of their utility in the
              reduction of nitro compounds;  and design of a flow photochemical reactor for
              high product output  and low solvent consumption.    In this study,
              photoinduced (light inititiated) transformations of  organic compounds using
              particulate semiconductors as catalysts are  explored.  Emphasis is on
              reduction of organic compounds containing  oxygen or nitrogen.  This approach
              requires no expendable reducing  agents, which are a major source of
              toxic-metal waste.  In addition  to its potential for avoidance of toxic
              byproducts, this approach  may also be useful for destruction of existing toxic
              wastes.
