Abstract    :
              9308450  Shapley  This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and 
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, is concerned with the  synthesis and
              reactivity of high oxidation state Fe, Ru, and Os  complexes.  A major focus
              will be on new complexes that contain  two multiply bonded ligands (oxo,
              sulfido, imido), which are  expected to be effective for atom (O, S) or group
              (NR) transfer  to unsaturated hydrocarbons.  Also to be investigated are 
              coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium based olefin  polymerization catalysts,
              unique chromium-osmium  heterobimetallic oxidation catalysts and their use in
              kinetic  resolution of alcohols, and novel high oxidation state  organoiron
              derivatives.  %%%  This project focusses on the design and synthesis of new 
              transition metal containing molecules that are predicted to  have unique, and
              potentially useful, chemical reactivities.  These compounds may ultimately be
              utilized in the synthesis of  new pharmaceuticals, and as catalysts for the
              preparation of  polymers.  ***
