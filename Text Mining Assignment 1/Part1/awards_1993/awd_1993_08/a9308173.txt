              Discourse Structures    This is the second part funding of a standard award
              initiated in  FY93 and processed as a swing grant to conduct research on the 
              empirical verification of the Grosz-Sidner theory of structural  discourse
              analysis, and on the correlation of intonational  indicators with both global
              and local structures of discourse.  The  subject of study is a multiple speaker
              corpus (to assure generality  of results and experiments that can be
              replicated) of discourse  from instructional and narrative genres; the corpus
              is annotated  subjectively for structural characteristics and, independently
              and  objectively, for intonational features using signal analysis  methods,
              with the purpose of establishing the correlation between  the two taggings.  A
              positive, well-established, correlation would  allow the use of those discourse
              features indicating intonational  variations in algorithms that produce
              corresponding intonational  variations in synthesized speech of quality higher
              ordinary.  The  results of this project should establish the relationship
              between  discourse structures and the phonetically determined signal  features
              of discourse.
