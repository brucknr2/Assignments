Abstract    :
              9308948  Murphy  The goal of this research project is to understand how passive 
              and active constraints contribute to the control of the motion of  the knee.  A
              mathematical model based on geometric parameters  will be developed and used to
              determine the roles of the  different components of the knee in the kinematics.
               The model  will also be used to determine the significance of the geometry  of
              the joint and how the geometry affects movement.    The model that will be
              developed could be important in  formulating rehabilitation programs, for
              determining the response  of the knee to clinical procedures, and for improving
              the design  and implantation of joint prostheses.  ***
