Abstract    :
              9308005  McMIllan    Large-Scale Numerical Simulations of Stellar Systems.   
              Dr. McMillan will continue to develop a new tree-based, high-order  integration
              scheme for the numerical simulation of collisional N-body  systems.  While a
              program already in place is now in rudimentary working  order, it still lacks
              most of the features necessary to make it useful for the  simulation of real
              star clusters.  The aim now is to complete the code  development, perform
              extensive tests of the program's suitability for stellar-  dynamical
              applications, and begin to apply it to the problem of globular  cluster
              evolution.  The result will be a state-of-the-art stellar-dynamical  simulation
              program, and an improved understanding of the mechanisms  driving the evolution
              and appearance of globular star clusters.
