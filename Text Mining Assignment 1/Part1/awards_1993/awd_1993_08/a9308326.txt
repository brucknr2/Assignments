Abstract    :
              9308326  McPherson    This research will test a theory arguing that groups gain
              and lose  members through the social network connections between individuals, 
              and through competition between groups for the time and other  resources of the
              people in the community.  A previous NSF grant  gathered data on 1050
              individuals and 254 groups in 10 communities.   This new project will test
              group level hypotheses through inductive  coding and analysis of group level
              data, and it will make the group  data available to the public.    The project
              will significantly expand scientific understanding of   the dynamics of growth
              and decline of organizations, with potential  benefit for corporations and
              voluntary groups as well as advancing  basic sociological theory.    ***
