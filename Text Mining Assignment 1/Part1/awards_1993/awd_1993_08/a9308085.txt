Abstract    :
              Lo         This research is on a class of concurrent error detecting  (CED)
              methods for design in CMOS VLSI.  The basis for the  research is a novel
              built-in current sensor which is critical to  new design methods for CED
              circuits in static CMOS.  This  technique is being applied to designs of
              floating point  arithmetic units, processor control units, on-chip cache 
              memories, and fast fourier transform processors.  Algorithms for  partitioning
              realistic faults into subsets, those that are  detectable by the current sensor
              and those that are not, are  being developed.  New design rules for hardware
              redundancy are  being explored.
