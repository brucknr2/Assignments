Abstract    :
              9308822  Ryu  This project is on research to develop an  expression and
              secretion system for the yeast  Yarrowia Lipolytica.  The work involves 
              extensive molecular biological studies which  includes development of a 
              transformation-secretion system, genetic  analysis of a promoter, and isolation
              of a  high secretion mutant.  The developed strain  will be used to express
              model proteins of  industrial relevance, and a two stage  fed-batch reactor
              system will be used to  optimize expression levels.
