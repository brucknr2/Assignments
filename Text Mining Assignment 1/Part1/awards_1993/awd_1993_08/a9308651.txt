Abstract    :
              9308651  Barmak        This project examines grain structure and grain boundary 
              diffusion in thin film niobium aluminide polycrystalline films of  different
              thicknesses and microstructures.  The kinetics of Nb3Al  formation are studied
              with calorimetry and transmission electron  microscopy.  A model for the Nb3Al
              formation will be modified based  on the measurements of shape, growth rate,
              and nucleation density.   Nucleation sites will be linked to microstructural
              features of the  reactant layers.  Direct measurements of the composition of
              Nb3-xAl  phase will be made by analytical electron microscopy.  An increase  in
              the Al concentration of the Nb3-xAl phase with an increase in the  total
              boundary area of the Nb3Al layer should provide direct  evidence for the role
              of grain boundary diffusion in the reaction.  %%%       This research has
              relevance to thin film devices used in the  microelectronic and magnetic thin
              film industries.  ***
