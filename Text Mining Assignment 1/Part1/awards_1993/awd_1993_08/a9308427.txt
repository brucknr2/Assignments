Abstract    :
              9308427  Vaez-Iravani  This grant will support research in the area of
              near-field  optical microscopy.  The investigator will combine non-  contact
              force microscopy with fluorescence and phase  contrast near field scanning
              optical microscopy.  It is  anticipated that this technique will improve the
              resolution  significantly over other techniques.  Both biological  structures
              and porous silicon photoluminescent surfaces will  be imaged.    This research
              is important since it is likely that it will  advance the state-of-the-art in
              the field of optical  microscopy.  This new method of obtaining high resolution
               images should have an impact in many disciplines including  structural
              biology, immunology and materials science.  ***
