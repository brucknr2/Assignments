Abstract    :
                Adding instruction-level parallelism to an architecture is a  technique 
              becoming popular for increasing power in modern computers.  One  consequence of
              this trend is the need to include instruction scheduling in  a compiler.
              ``Global Instruction Scheduling Without Copies'' investigates a  method of
              global sch\-eduling which, unlike other global scheduling  techniques  does not
              suffer from the need for compensation copies. The  work's goal is  refining a
              technique for scheduling which will work better  than existing  methods for ILP
              architectures with limited parallelism, a  characteristic of ILP  architectures
              found today, and expected for  superscalar architectures in the  future. The
              study investigates  dominator-path scheduling (DPS) in some  detail and compare
              DPS to other  global scheduling methods. Since DPS is better  suited than other
               scheduling techniques for the levels of ILP found in current  architectures,
              one outcome of the research is the ability to generate  better code for
              currently popular computers. Additionally, the work  quantifies the parallelism
              available in imperative programs when  compensation  copies are not allowed.
              This measurement of such parallelism will  influence the design of ILP
              architectures in the future.
