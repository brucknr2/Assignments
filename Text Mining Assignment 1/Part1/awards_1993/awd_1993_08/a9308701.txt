Abstract    :
               Large networks form an essential part of the modern global  infrastructure.  It
              is essential to use and manage these  networks in the most efficient way
              possible.  This project  focuses on two fundamental problems in network
              optimization:  (1) computing flows and cuts, and (2) scheduling processes on a
              network  of processors.  The goal is to design efficient algorithms, both 
              sequential and parallel, for a range of problems in these fields.  The flow and
              cut problems include maximum flows,  multicommodity flows and minimum cuts. 
              This work on basic  network algorithms has applications ranging from cutting 
              plane algorithms for traveling salesman problems to VLSI design  problems to
              sparse matrix problems.  The scheduling work  analyzes problems of scheduling
              processes on a network of  processors and develops algorithms that help to
              decide  whether jobs should be processed locally or sent over the network  to a
              remote processor.  By understanding the complexity of  scheduling on various
              parallel machines and networks of machines,  current computers can be better
              utilized and future computers can  be designed based on the difficulty of
              scheduling on that  machine.  The work will have a significant experimental 
              component, taking advantage of access to a DECmpp 12000 with 2K  processors.
