Abstract    :
                      9308033  Smith  This applicant will apply multidisciplinary to examine a
              long-  standing hypothesis relating an animal's size to its environment 
              (Bergmann's Rule).  The study will focus on woodrat middens over  a 35,000 year
              span, and will incorporate DNA studies of fossil  hair, the relationship
              between fecal pellet size and body mass,  deposition data, and climatic
              changes.  Using technique available  from other disciplines, materials from
              dated middens will be used  to estimate species and their body size, and relate
              that  information to geographic location and climatic conditions at the  time
              of deposition.  This work will be conducted under the  direction of Drs. James
              H. Brown, Donald Natvig, and Margaret  Werner-Washburne, all of the University
              of New Mexico, and Dr.  Julio Betancourt of the U.S. Geological Survey.  ***
