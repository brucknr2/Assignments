Abstract    :
                   The research entails investigations of several problems in                
              the area of complex geometry.  These are mainly to do with metric              
              rigidity properties and holonomy groups on compact complex                     
              manifolds.  This research provides insight into topological                    
              questions and has potential applications to mathematical physics.
