Abstract    :
              9308017  FARSOUN  This project is a sociological study of the Israeli military
              court  system.  It will focus on how authority and resistance in the  occupied
              territories interact in the court system.  Data will be  collected on the
              network of relations among the various categories  of participants (Israelis
              and Palestinians), and on Israeli legal  discourse about the occupation which
              provides the justification for  Israeli legal authority.  The study will cover
              three main topic  areas.  First, the investigator will conduct an ethnography
              of the  roles, practices and relations of the Israeli and Palestinian 
              participants.  Second, the investigator will analyze the  controversy over the
              military court system's legitimacy from the  perspectives of the participants,
              especially the interaction  between authority and resistance as it is
              negotiated in practice.   Third, the investigator will conduct a sociological
              analysis of  Israeli legal culture as it relates to the debate over the 
              applicability of international law to Israeli authority over the  occupied
              territories.    ***
