Abstract    :
                9308687  Wright  Under his previous NSF grant, the investigator used search
              theory  to formalize the transactions role of money.  This was an  important
              contribution because it allowed analysts to rigorously  study the way
              preferences, production possibilities, technology  and market frictions shape
              the pattern of trade.  Work using a  search-theoretic approach to money demand
              is providing many new  insights into money's function and the relationships
              between  money and real variables.  This project will develop a new line  of
              bargaining monetary models of search and price formation,  introduce credit
              into search models of money.  The project will  continue research on the
              microfoundations of "who meets who and  how" that are behind the entire search
              framework, on an  evolutionary approach to search models of money, and on money
               with private information.    The research on price formation addresses an
              important criticism  of existing models of money demand.  These models are
              incomplete,  in the sense that while they analyze the exchange process, they 
              neglect the determination of prices.  Either these models assume  that prices
              are fixed, or they assume that objects are  indivisible and therefore must
              trade one-for-one, or they impose  some other ad hoc assumption on prices.  The
              framework developed  under this project has explicit bilateral bargaining over
              prices,  so that monetary exchange rates are not assumed but derived from  the
              model.  The development of these models will permit the  systematic study of
              the way the underlying strategic environment  affects money and price
              formation.  ***
