Abstract    :
              9308409  Marwitz       Severe wintertime weather, such as freezing weather,
              aircraft  icing conditions, can be life threatening and very disruptive to 
              human activity.         Using data from previously completed field programs and
              an  advanced numerical mesoscale atmospheric model, the Principal  Investigator
              will study a variety of hazardous winter weather  phenomenon.  A primary focus
              will be to investigate the existence  and characteristics of large supercooled
              water drops which are  believed to be a necessary condition for severe icing
              conditions  for aircraft.  Additionally, the Principal Investigator will study 
               effects of the dynamics and kinematics of shear layers and their  association
              with large drop regions in clouds and the  meteorological characteristics of a
              severe freezing rain episode.       Successful completion of this research will
              contribute to  efforts for better forecasting of these severe winter weather 
              events.  ***
