Abstract    :
              9308139  Myerson    The goal of this project is to develop a better
              understanding of  how the design of political institutions can affect political
               behavior, with hope that such understanding may be valuable for  guiding
              decisions about constitutional design in new and reforming  democracies.  In
              particular, the researcher will continue his  research on game-theoretic
              comparison of political institutions by  looking into several extensions.   
              First, electoral systems will be compared by analyzing large finite  voting
              games in which the numbers of voters of different types are  independent random
              variables.  Then the effectiveness of different  electoral systems for reducing
              government corruption by considering  single transferable vote and other
              electoral systems will be  investigated.  Second, the tendency of plurality
              voting elections  to become two-party contests is known as Duverger's law.  The
               investigator will work to derive Duverger's law from game-theoretic  analysis.
                   Third, a variety of game-theoretic models that may account for  observed
              differences between parliamentary and presidential systems  will be studied. 
              This question has been an important area of study  in the empirical literature
              on comparative politics, but there is  a need for game-theoretic models to
              guide and complement empirical  work.  Finally, the investigator's long term
              plan is to integrate  the results of his research, together with other related
              results in  formal political theory and social choice theory, into a general 
              monograph on game-theoretic models for comparing political  institutions.
