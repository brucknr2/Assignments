Abstract    :
              9308900  Berman  In this proposal, we outline a model and a mechanism for 
              scheduling large-scale scientific applications on a non-dedicated 
              heterogeneous network of computers.  To obtain efficient  schedules, our system
              will consider both domain-and application-  specific information as well as
              system-wide characteristics.  We  seek a scalable and portable scheduling
              system with applicability  to a wide variety of computational environments.  We
              plan to use  two important scientific applications with diverse computational 
              requirements (global climate modeling and PACVHM) to test our  scheduler.  The
              initial implementation will use PVM as the  underlying control mechanism.  Our
              intent, is that the scheduler  will be able to use any distributed task control
              as it  foundation.  ***
