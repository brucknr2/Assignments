Abstract    :
              9308414  Bergbreiter    We propose to modify polyolefins polymers by surface 
              polymerization.  We aim to adapt existing synthetic methods and  develop new
              procedures to incorporate initiators into the surface  interphase of
              polyolefins.  The proposed reactions and methods have  precedent in
              solution-state studies and in preliminary work.  Our  syntheses are designed to
              incorporate spectroscopic labels to  facilitate characterization of the
              modified polymers before and  after surface polymerizations.  XPS  
              spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy  and conventional physical analyses such as
              contact angle analysis  will be used to characterize the modified surfaces. 
              Fluorescent  labels in conjunction with quenching groups elsewhere on the 
              surface or in solution will be used to study the 2- and 3-  dimensional
              character of these interfaces and the effect of graft  polymerization on these
              interfaces.  Our proposed procedures  promise to provide levels of synthetic
              control not available with  existing grafting chemistry.  ***
