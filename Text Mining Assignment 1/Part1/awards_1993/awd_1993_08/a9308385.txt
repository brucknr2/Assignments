Abstract    :
                9308385  Bernanke    This research improves our understanding of how monetary
              policy  works and how it can best be used.  The approach will be  primarily
              empirical and comparative, with the experiences of a  variety of countries
              during both the postwar and interwar periods  being considered.  Three basic
              questions about the operation of  monetary policy will be addressed:  (1) How
              do we go about deciding whether a given monetary policy  is "tight" or "easy"? 
              That is, are there reliable indicators of  monetary policy stance?  (2) How do
              changes in monetary policy have their effects on the  economy, i.e., what is
              the monetary transmission mechanism?  (3)  What is the best general framework
              or strategy for  conducting monetary policy -- rules, discretion, or something 
              else?    The largest portion of the research will be on monetary  transmission,
              with a dominant theme being the role of capital  market imperfections.  In the
              postwar context, the project uses  data from a variety of countries to address
              whether monetary  policy works primarily by affecting the quantity of the 
              transactions medium (the traditional "money view") or the  quantity of bank
              lending (the "lending view").  The project  quantifies the relative importance
              of the two channels and  considers some alternative ways in which capital
              market  imperfections affect monetary transmission.  In the interwar  context,
              the project uses multi-country data sets in order to  assess the relative
              importance of nominal rigidities such as  sticky wages and of deflation-induced
              financial distress in  transmitting monetary shocks.  ***
