                  A special workshop will be held during March 24-26, 1993 at               
              Millstone Hill in Westford, Massachusetts for participants in the

              participants in the study to get together for in-depth discussions             
              and planning joint papers for presentation and eventual journal                
              publication.  A special session has been planned at the Spring 1993            
              AGU meeting where papers emanating from this workshop will be                  
              presented.
