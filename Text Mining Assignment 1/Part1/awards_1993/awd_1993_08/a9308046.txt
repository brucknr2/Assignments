Abstract    :
                  9308046  Serrano  This applicant will study molecular biology technique
              which he  then plans to bring to examinations of behavioral indices of  memory
              development.  Specifically, he will begin by screening a  rat hippocampus
              genomic library for the GAP43/F1 gene which has  been reported to exhibit
              differential expression in discrete  areas of the rat hippocampus development,
              induced seizures, and  long term potentiation.  A clone of the gene will be
              used to  study regulation of its expression.  This work will be conducted  in
              the laboratory of Dr. Aryeh Routtenberg at Northwestern  University and G. Horn
              at Cambridge University.  ***
