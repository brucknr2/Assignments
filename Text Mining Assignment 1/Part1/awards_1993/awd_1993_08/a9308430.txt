Abstract    :
              9308430  Sinha  In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Prof. A. Sinha of the University of California at San Diego
              will conduct a research program to study the influence of molecular vibrations
              on the chemical reactivity of polyatomic molecules.  The effect of specific
              vibrational modes in bimolecular reactions will be investigated by exciting
              vibrational states of reagent molecules having  similar energy, and observing
              the consequences of this initial  state selection on the reaction rate, the
              product quantum state distributions, and the product branching ratios.  This
              will be accomplished by using several different laser excitation schemes to
              prepare vibrational states corresponding to a wide range of nuclear motion in
              small polyatomic molecules and then monitoring their subsequent reactions with
              various radicals by detecting the reaction products using laser spectroscopy. 
              %%%  The study of chemical reactions and their associated reaction dynamics
              stands at the forefront of contemporary physical chemistry. The goal of the
              present study is to understand how various molecular vibrations having similar
              total energy but corresponding to different intramolecular distribution of the
              excitation influence chemical reactivity.  Measurements in which the excited
              states are fully resolved yield data which allow detailed comparisons with
              current theoretical models and promise to provide new insights into the factors
              that influence selectivity in chemical reactions.  ***
