Abstract    :
                9308637  McKelvey    Despite the widespread use of game theoretic models in
              the social  sciences, there is as yet no software available to solve 
              computationally game theory problems.  This project develops and  tests the
              first computer programs for analysis of extensive form  games.  The computer
              code (both source and executable code) that  is developed under this grant will
              be made available free of  charge for use in research and teaching by
              individuals in the  academic community.  This new software will open up the
              entire  field of game theory and all of the social science applications  of
              game theory to computationally intensive research.       More specifically, the
              project develops a computer program for  interactively building and finding
              sample equilibria for  extensive form games.  It also implements new algorithms
              for  finding all equilibria (for a given refinement of Nash  equilibria) for
              any given extensive form game.  The main program  will allow for interactive
              construction of an arbitrary finite  extensive form game.  It will be able to
              represent games of  incomplete information, as well as certain types of
              infinitely  repeated and stochastic games.  For any extensive form game, the 
              program will compute sample equilibria of the game, either on the  extensive or
              normal form, i.e., in behavioral or mixed  strategies.  In addition to Nash
              equilibria, the program will be  able to compute various refinements of Nash
              equilibria, such as  sequential equilibria, perfect equilibria, proper
              equilibria, and  simple stable sets.  One goal of the project is to develop a 
              capability for the program to calculate closed form analytical  formulas for an
              equilibrium as a function of a specified  parameter of the problem.  ***
