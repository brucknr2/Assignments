Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research project involves the synthesis of linear and             
              dendrimeric polymers that contain covalently-bound chromophores                
              will serve a dual purpose as fluorescent probes to characterize the            
              polymer system itself or to elucidate the effect of the polymer                
              environment on photochemical processes.  The polymers to be studied            
              are amphiphilic, with a hydrophobic block or end and a hydrophilic             
              block or surface.  Because of the strong differences in the                    
              solubility of these blocks the materials can self-assemble into                
              micelle structures or adsorb onto hydrophobic surfaces, including              
              liquid-liquid interfaces.  The nature of the self-assembly depends             
              on the molecular architecture and solvent/temperature conditions.              
              A combination of fluorescence methods such as energy transfer,                 
              time-dependent fluorescence depolarization, and fluorescence                   
              quenching will be used to characterize the environment and spatial             
              arrangement of polymer segments in the following systems:  1)                  
              polymer micelles from diblock polymers; 2) surface adsorbed diblock            
              or hydrophobically end-tagged polymers; 3) polymers covalently end-            
              grafted to surfaces; 4) dendrimeric polymers either in homogeneous             
              solution or covalently bonded to a surface.  In addition to these              
              synthetic and photophysical experiments, we have undertaken the                
              application of computational methods to simulate polymers at                   
              interfaces.  These are expected to help in the design and                      
              interpretation of our experiments and provide a useful additions to            
              the numerical methods available to test predictions or analytical              
              theory of polymers at interfaces.                                              
                                                                                             
              This photophysical research aims to clarify how polymers can modify            
              or effect reactions at interfaces.  Potential applications include             
              photoreactive films, gels, micelles, and surfactants.
