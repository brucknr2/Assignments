              Neifeld Smart SLMs are extremely important to the next generation of optical
              computing and processing.  This class of device represents the enabling
              technology for the realization of interconnects, neural networks, image
              processing and other forms of parallel optical computing.  This proposal
              discusses the use of a         ?       Si:H/a Si   x   C   1 x   :H multilayers
              as optical modulators which are compatible with Si VLSI and can therefore be
              integrated with sophisticated processing electronics to yield smart SLMs
              offering visible wavelength operation, high speed, broad functionality and
              simple, inexpensive fabrication requirements.  Initial efforts have produced
              evidence that bound state quantization will occur in amorphous semiconductor
              material system will be investigated.  High quality constituent materials and
              interfaces will be produced.  Through sample deposition and characterization
              fabrication parameters will be optimized.  Second, multilayer structures will
              be fabricated to optimize modulator characteristics.  This component involves
              characterization of MQW samples so that quantization effects and in particular
              the effects of band tail states, may be analyzed.  Third, techniques will be
              developed to integrate these modulators with CMOS VLSI.  This last component
              will focus on experim ental techniques necessary to fabricate amorphous
              semiconductor modulators on existing CMOS electronic circuits and will make use
              of the MOSIS facility to provide VLSI addressing circuits.
