Abstract    :
              Copper ZSM-5 is the most active catalyst known for reduction and               
              decomposition of nitric oxide, but has limitations that limit                  
              it use in practical situations.  This effort tests the theory                  
              that the active site consists of cuprous ions stabilized by the                
              zeolite matrix.  Other oxides such as copper molybdenum oxide                  
              and copper zinc oxide are tested for nitric-oxide decomposition.               
              In addition, the role of lattice oxygen on the reduction of                    
              nitric oxide by hydrocarbons in an oxidizing atmosphere is                     
              examined.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Abatement of nitric oxide is an urgent environmental priority.                 
              Catalysts for converting nitric oxide to nitrogen in an                        
              environmentally benign manner are of great interest for                        
              pollution control from motor vehicles, power plants, and other                 
              sources.
