Abstract    :
              9308118  Elimelech  This is an award to support research, the  objective of
              which is to study the influence  of interfacial hydrodynamics on deposition of 
              particles in porous media.  The investigator  plans on conducting
              well-controlled particle  deposition experiments to test theoretical 
              predictions and to use these observations in  delineation of the mechanisms
              under which  fluid flow and interfacial forces affect  collision efficiencies
              that have an influence  on particle deposition in porous media.    This is a
              renewal of research previously  conducted under NSF Grant No. 90-09233.  The 
              results of this research are expected to  provide a better understanding of the
              role  that fluid flow characteristics play in the  process by which particles
              are retained  within porous media.  The fundamental nature  of this work is
              expected to have significance  in engineering design of filtration processes 
              used for water and wastewater treatment,  chromatographic separation and other 
              processes that involve particle-surface  interaction phenomena.
