Abstract    :
              9308662  Eshaghian  A novel parallel programming tool called Cluster-M will be 
              implemented.  Cluster-M provides an environment for  efficiently designing
              highly parallel machine independent  software.  Using this tool a single
              parallel program can be  ported, mapped and executed on various multiprocessor 
              systems, therefore, significantly reducing the cost of  software development. 
              Also designing parallel algorithms  using Cluster-M is simple and need not be
              done by an expert.  The main components of this paradigm are the Cluster-M 
              specifications and representations. Cluster-M specification  is a highly
              parallel program which specifies the  communication and computation
              requirements of a solution to  a given problem by exploiting and emphasizing
              all the  concurrent tasks at every step of an algorithm.  On the  other hand,
              Cluster-M representation represents the  processor interconnection topology of
              the underlying  architectures.  The specification can be mapped onto  different
              Cluster-M representations, using the mapping  methodologies, which are proposed
              to be implemented.  ***
