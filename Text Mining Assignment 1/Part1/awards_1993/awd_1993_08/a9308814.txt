Abstract    :
              9308814  Roychowdhury  Investigation of the computing characteristics of a
              simple non-linear capacitively coupled network based on classical.  Coulomb
              blockade phenomena is proposed.  Such a network could be implemented by
              fabricating an array of conductive islands that interact with each other
              capacitively. In the first phase, the feasibility of designing simple arrays to
              execute elementary computations such as logic operations and simple
              applications involving associative memory will be examined.  This first step
              will be followed by an investigation of the feasibility of implementing more
              complex computational tasks using more elaborate arrays.  The theoretical
              effort proposed is expected to culminate in the formulation of novel device and
              circuit design concepts applicable to nanoelectronics.  ***
