              ABSTRACT    This SGER project explores the extension of electrochemical
              chromatography from particulate substrates coated with conducting polymer to
              monolithic structures.  A radial flow unit will be fabricated of very porous
              reticulated vitreous carbon coated with conducting polymer (e.g.
              poly-N-alkylpyrrole) and tested for binding capacity and reversible binding of
              model proteins with different isoelectric points.    Improvements of ion
              exchange chromatography in terms of throughput, separation efficiency and
              reagent needs will have significant positive effect on the costs of biochemical
              products.              .D >"    CHASE1  EXE             ,  "    INVADERSEXE
