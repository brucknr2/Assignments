Abstract    :
                   This award is for the establishment of an Industry/University             
              Cooperative Research Center for Emission Reduction Research Center             
              (ERRC) at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT).                           
                   The focus of the ERRC research is on reducing pollution in                
              "batch processing" on manufacturing typically used by                          
              pharmaceutical and the specialty chemicals industry.  Some of the              
              planned research projects at the Center include:  novel                        
              amphiphillic star polymers as solvents for emission control in the             
              pharmaceutical industry; novel ceramic membranes for VOC Separation            
              and AI system for process design and performance monitoring etc.               
                   A comprehensive solvent database will also be built to assist             
              optimum solvent selection and experiment with solvent replacement              
              opportunities where organic solvent systems potentially can be                 
              replaced with aqueous or neat systems.                                         
                   Besides NJIT, the Ohio State University, Penn State and MIT               
              will also participate in the research program of the I/UCRC.                   
                   The Program Manager recommends New Jersey Institute of                    
              Technology be award $50,000 for the first year of a five-year                  
              continuing award.                                                              
                   Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager                  
              and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers              
              Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of                 
              renewal criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which             
              the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) extent to                
              which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a             
              collaborative, robust research program is developing.  If the                  
              review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support             
              for the next period of this continuing award.
