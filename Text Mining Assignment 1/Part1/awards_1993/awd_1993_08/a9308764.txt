Abstract    :
              The importance of power electronic                                             
              equipment has stimulated research in                                           
              computer-aided design tools.                                                   
              General purpose simulators developed                                           
              for non-switched analog (and mixed                                             
              mode) networks are not suitable.                                               
              Events of interest in a typical                                                
              power converter cover many orders of                                           
              time scale magnitude, from                                                     
              nanoseconds to seconds.  The work                                              
              proposed here uses a new switch                                                
              model and an innovative cycle                                                  
              averaging scheme to speed up the                                               
              numerical integration.  A desktop PC                                           
              implementation of the simulation                                               
              algorithm is proposed.
