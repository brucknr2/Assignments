Abstract    :
              The reallocation of workers from one job to another involves                   
              large numbers of workers at all phases of the business cycle,                  
              indeed between 5 and 10 per cent of all employed workers per                   
              quarter.  In addition, recent empirical evidence confirms job                  
              destruction is at least as important as job creation as a source               
              of fluctuations in aggregate employment.  In recent work, the                  
              investigator has developed a model of the labor market to account              
              for these facts.  The purpose of this project is to further                    
              develop and then to use the model to analyze a number of                       
              important questions regarding the labor market.  Some of these                 
              questions are:  (1) In the context of the model, does the                      
              empirical fact that wages tend to be rigid have important                      
              quantitative consequences for the level of unemployment and for                
              worker welfare?  (2) What are the expected magnitudes of the                   
              effects of severance pay and prior separation notice policies on               
              job creation and on job destruction?  (3) Technical progress is                
              often associated with the need to reallocate workers from old                  
              technologies to new ones.  To what extent does this process                    
              contribute to unemployment?  (4) Who benefits from and who bears               
              the cost of the worker reallocation process?  This project is                  
              important because answers to these questions have important                    
              implications for our better understanding of worker reallocation,              
              and its effects on the experience of unemployed workers as well                
              as on the aggregate level of employment.
