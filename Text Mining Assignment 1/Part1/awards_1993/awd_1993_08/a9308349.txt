Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research examines the micro-foundations of the determinants of            
              the level and growth of productivity in developing countries by                
              focussing on the roles of firm level research and development (R&D)            
              and job training expenditures.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the project are to (1) describe the incidence and            
              patterns of firm level training and R&D expenditures; (2) study the            
              economic factors that influence firm decisions to invest in R&D and            
              training; and (3) the impact of R&D and job training on the level              
              and change in productivity at the firm level.                                  
                                                                                             
              At the heart of productivity growth is technological change.  In               
              rapidly developing countries, the encouragement of high technology             
              development is closely linked to a growth strategy which is export-            
              oriented.  Furthermore, at the microlevel, success at the exporting            
              game is often linked to large enterprises.  Here we link the three             
              forces of technology, export-orientation and productivity in                   
              determining firm investment decisions and their outcome.                       
                                                                                             
              This research is based on a unique and rich micro-database of the              
              Taiwan Census of Manufactures for the period from 1976 to 1991 that            
              covers all plants in the country's manufacturing sector.  Data on              
              firm-level R&D, training and export sales, virtually non-existent              
              for most countries, are reported in this database.  This data is               
              combined with recently developed microdata empirical techniques to             
              gain insights into the determinants and effects of key factors in              
              the industrial development process in rapidly developing economies.
