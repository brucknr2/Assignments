Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT --- CTS-9308664  Application of electric and magnetic fields to enhance
              bulk mixing of reactants in diffusion controlled burning to improve combustion
              is proposed.  Numerical modeling will be developed to substantiate preliminary
              experiments and additional experimentation is proposed.  Alkali metal seeding
              will be used to enhance the electrical conductivity of the flame and therefore,
              the Lorentz body forces acting on the flame.  A novel optical spectroscopic
              technique for temperature measurement is also proposed making use of the seed
              alkali metal.
