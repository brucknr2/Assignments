Abstract    :
              9308650  Kay  We propose an in-depth investigation of charge and heat transport
              in semiconductor field emission devices via two-dimensional numerical
              simulations.  The major goal of this work will be to examine heat generation
              and dissipation within emitter structures to answer fundamental questions
              concerning field emitter failure mechanisms.  This investigation will also 
              provide insight into routine operation of these devices.  A new  prototype test
              array of field emitter devices currently under development and fabrication here
              at Northeastern University will provide a wealth of data for experimental
              correlation unavailable anywhere else.  Transport in the emitter interior will
              be modeled using the semiconductor driftdiffusion equations and the heat flow
              equation.  Targeted areas of study will be the physics of disruptive breakdown
              and the effects of Joule heating, with substantial effort devoted to analyzing
              "whisker" structures which provide area of local field enhancement.  ***
