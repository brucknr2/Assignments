Abstract    :
              9308921  Wright  This research grant will fund a study that should advance the 
              field of magnetic resonance microscopy by developing methods to  acquire more
              data per unit time than is presently possible and to  improve the
              signal-to-noise ratio of the data.  Arrays of radio  frequency sensors will be
              used.  The goals are the following: 1)  to develop an understanding of the
              signal-to-noise performance of  the arrays; 2) to develop computer-aided design
              tools to model  the interactions between the arrays and the environment; 3) to 
              minimize the noise correlation in the array; 4) to develop  inexpensive
              hardware to enable the use of the arrays with  existing and new systems; and 5)
              to evaluate the arrays.    This research on coil arrays is important since it
              will enable  the fields of magnetic resonance microscopy and functional 
              imaging to be advanced and this research has the potential to  maintain the
              costs associated with these improvements.  ***
