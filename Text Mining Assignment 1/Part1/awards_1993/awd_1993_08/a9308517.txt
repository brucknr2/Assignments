Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              RIA:  Semantic Concurrency Control for Real-Time Object-Oriented               
              Databases                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This research addresses the design of concurrency control                      
              techniques for real-time object-oriented databases.  There are                 
              two components to the research: (1) development of a formal                    
              schema model of a real-time object-oriented database system; and               
              (2) development of real-time concurrency control techniques that               
              employ application semantics and imprecision to support                        
              enforcement of all of the forms of constraints in a real-time                  
              object-oriented database. These forms of constraints are: data                 
              object logical consistency constraints, data object temporal                   
              consistency constraints, transaction logical consistency                       
              constraints, and transaction timing constraints.  The concurrency              
              control  technique uses a concurrency control component                        
              encapsulated within each object that expresses conditional                     
              compatibility and semantic locking of object methods.  This                    
              project implements the semantic real-time concurrency control                  
              techniques using a prototype real-time object-oriented database                
              system.  The research is useful in real-time control applications              
              with large amounts of time-constrained data, such as: medical                  
              intensive care patient monitoring, vehicle control,                            
              manufacturing, and programmed stock trading; as well as for                    
              introducing  a better general paradigm for management of real-                 
              time data in complex  applications.
