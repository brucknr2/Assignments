Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Czech Joint Fund                              
              research project between Dr. Petr Carsky,                                      
              Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry and                                  
              Electrochemistry, Czech Academy of Sciences, and                               
              Dr. Josef Michl, University of Colorado-Boulder,                               
              is to study intensities in vibrational and                                     
              electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of a                                  
              variety of molecules.  The US side will                                        
              contribute experimental data and computing                                     
              facilities; the Czech side will provide expertise                              
              in fundamental theory and ab initio program                                    
              development.  Results should yield important                                   
              insights into the electronic structures of                                     
              molecules including diatomics and such                                         
              hydrocarbons as benzene.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research in theoretical chemistry fulfills                                
              the program objective of advancing scientific                                  
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S.                              
              and Czech Republic to combine complementary                                    
              talents and pool research resources in areas of                                
              strong mutual interest and competence.  Funds for                              
              the project are awarded through the US-Czech                                   
              Joint Fund, Prague, in accordance with                                         
              established guidelines.
