Abstract    :
              9308105  Pearson  The focus of this research is the development of new methods 
              for carbon-carbon bond formation using a variety of organoiron  complexes.
              There are four specific aspects of organoiron  chemistry that will be studied.
              The first aspect investigates  new protocols for the generation of free
              radicals from  dienyliron complexes and their intramolecular coupling with 
              pendant olefinic groups to form carbocyclic ring systems. This  represents the
              first application of organometallic free  radicals in synthetically useful
              processes. The second aspect  studies extensions and applications of
              iron-promoted  carbonylative annulation of diynes and enynes for formation of 
              cyclopentadienoneiron complexes and cyclopentenones. The third  area explores
              intramolecular carbon nucleophile additions to  cyclohexadienyliron cations to
              provide important new methods  for the construction of densely functionalized
              molecules. The  final aspect exploits the ability of an organoiron moiety to 
              control stereochemistry during multiple functionalization of  eight-membered
              rings, which are traditionally difficult to  handle; the use of organometallic
              chemistry provides solutions  to problems of conformational and stereochemical
              control.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting 
              the research of Dr. Anthony J. Pearson of the Department of  Chemistry at Case
              Western Reserve University. Professor Pearson  will focus his work in the area
              of synthetic methodology  developing new methods for carbon-carbon bond
              formation using a  variety of organoiron complexes.  ***
