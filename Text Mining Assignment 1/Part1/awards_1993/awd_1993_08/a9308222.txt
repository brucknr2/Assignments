Abstract    :
              This award is made to the University of California/Davis in                    
              support of a career planning workshop for underrepresented                     
              minority undergraduate chemistry majors. The workshop will be                  
              held August 7-9, 1993 at the Davis campus and will be the first                
              of its kind in the western states. The objective is to bring                   
              minority students together with high-achieving minority mentors                
              from industry, academia and government in order to introduce                   
              the students to the opportunities created by obtaining an                      
              advanced degree in Chemistry. The workshop will be hosted by                   
              the University of California Davis Chemistry Department and                    
              will provide opportunities for the student participants to                     
              observe graduate research, advanced laboratory instrumentation,                
              and to meet with graduate students to discuss areas of mutual                  
              interest.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              This award is viewed as a way of encouraging interested                        
              minority undergraduates to continue their studies in Chemistry                 
              by introducing them to successful minority role-models in a                    
              supportive setting. The longer term objective is to increase                   
              the participation of minorities in the chemistry enterprise.
