Abstract    :
                   The limit distributions of GL-statistics with kernels which               
              are degenerate, of infinite order, or with estimated parameters                
              are proposed.  The underlying invariance principle of ``averaging              
              Kendall's tau on its marginals'' is also proposed. Furthermore,                
              an approach to derive new test statistics from some distances for              
              independence of circular data is proposed. Finally, a unifying                 
              theme for many circular rank statistics will be investigated.
