Abstract    :
              9308432  Bean       Through support by NSF and several companies, the
              researchers  have developed, over the past year, two powerful genetic-based 
              codes for solving jobshop scheduling problems and bounded variable  integer
              programs.  In a matter of minutes one can solve problems  such as 400 job,
              eight machine, total tardiness scheduling  problems, or 5000 variable
              multiple-choice integer programs to  within two to three percent of the best
              known solutions.  The codes  are currently in research prototype form.  The
              researchers will  refine and document the codes during the summer of 1993 so
              that  they can be deployed in three manners:  given to students in the  courses
              IOE 472 (Introduction to Operations Research,  undergraduate), IOE 5443 (
              Scheduling, master's) and IOE 614  (Integer Programming, Ph.D.) ; give them to
              representatives of  MasPar Computer and General Motors who will use them on
              current  manufacturing projects; and place them on an ftp bulletin board set 
              up by the genetic algorithm community.
