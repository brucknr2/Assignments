Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is efficient synthetic methodology                  
              based on the use of novel carbanions mainly produced by                        
              reduction of either small-ring oxygen heterocycles or of                       
              functionalized molecules containing the phenylthio group.  A                   
              major emphasis is the production and use of lithioalkenes, but                 
              oxygenated organolithiums will also be used.  Most of the                      
              methods involve the synthesis or modification of ring compounds                
              with an emphasis being on ring compounds found in natural                      
              products.  A highly novel investigation involves the                           
              copolymerization of butadiene and isoprene to a living polymer.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Theodore Cohen of the Department of                        
              Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Cohen                    
              will focus his work on the use of novel carbanions as                          
              intermediates in organic synthesis, mainly for the preparation                 
              or modification of cyclic compounds.
