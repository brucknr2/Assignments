Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT --CTS 9308813  Viljoen   The interdisciplinary problem of thermal
              stress in a chemical reacting system is addressed.  Examples of these phenomena
              are found in the failure of catalyst supports in packed bed reactors operating
              in the ignited state, reactions on metal gauzes, catalytic converters, and
              porous radiant burners (PRB).  The systematic analysis of these problems will
              enable us to design more durable supports, extend the life of converters and
              expensive gauze material (e.g., Pt) and expand the application of PRB's to
              transient and frequent shut-down-start-up operations.  Both a theoretical and
              experimental study of the problem is proposed.  The experimental program will
              be developed around ceramic samples with piezo-electric fibers embedded inside
              the matrix.  These samples of various forms and dimensions, will be exposed to
              a combustion environment.  Direct measurements of the stress will be made and
              results will be correlated with theoretical results.  The development of such
              an in-situ stress measurement technique for ceramic structures could also find
              important applications in other ceramic structures exposed to high
              stress/temperature environments.
