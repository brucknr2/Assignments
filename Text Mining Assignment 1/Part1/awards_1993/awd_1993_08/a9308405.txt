                                                9308405 Lohmann This research addresses two
              problems commonly associated with  collective action.  First, political
              outcomes tend to be biased in favor of small, well-organized groups and against
              large, diffuse groups.  As an explanation, it is often argued that smaller
              groups are more successful in overcoming the free rider problem of collective
              action.  Second, collective action may undermine the credibility of particular
              regulatory policies.  Firms may have disincentives to commit resources when
              they anticipate that the regulatory environment may change in response to
              interest groups and public  pressures.  To date the analysis of these two
              problems is based on reduced-form  models of political participation and
              decision-making.  This project will employ game theoretical techniques to
              explicitly derive people's incentives to become organized and policymakers'
              incentives to respond to their pressures.  This work will identify the factors
              affecting the efficiency of political outcomes and the tradeoffs inherent in
              the political design of regulatory policy. ***
