Abstract    :
              9308492  Barton       Computer simulation models are the laboratory for many
              today's  design engineers.  Circuits are simulated before they are  prototyped,
              exhaust systems are represented as finite element  simulations before they are
              built, and factories are modeled with  discrete event simulation before the
              ground is broken for a new  plant.  "Laboratory" tools for: (1) modeling random
              manufacturing  variations, (2) for identifying key design parameters, (3) for 
              developing and displaying simulation metamodels and (4) for aiding  in robust
              design optimization exist in engineering research.  Yet  they have not been
              transferred to engineering practice.  A new  graduate course, "Using Simulation
              Models for Engineering Design,"  presents recent research results in simulation
              sensitivity  analysis, metamodeling, and optimization for use in engineering 
              design case studies.  The case studies are based on computer aided  design
              models that have been developed and used in industry.       The department
              advisory group assessed the initial offering  as a significant contribution to
              a revised engineering curriculum,  but cited these key shortcomings: (1) the
              students spend  unnecessary time programming because software tools to exercise
              the  case study software are lacking, and (2) refinements and additions  to the
              lecture notes would make it easier to understand and  implement these tools. 
              This research to overcome these  shortcomings.
