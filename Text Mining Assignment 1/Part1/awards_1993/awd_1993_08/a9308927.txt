Abstract    :
              This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is                 
              made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Lily M. Ng of the                        
              Chemistry Department, Cleveland State University.  Chemical                    
              phenomena on semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces will be                      
              studied using in situ Fourier transform infrared reflection -                  
              attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy.  During                   
              the planning period, adsorption of carbon monoxide, carbon                     
              dioxide, acetate, ammonium, acetonitrile, methanol and thiourea                
              on the surfaces of silicon electrodes, Ni or Pt modified                       
              electrodes, and CdTe electrodes will be investigated during                    
              photovoltaic and photoassisted catalytic experiments.  This                    
              project is relevant to the development of more efficient                       
              photocells.
