Abstract    :
               By abstracting behavior and carefully engineering interfaces,  software
              building blocks, also called generic  components, can be produced that  are
              more easily composable and widely  usable than the specialized  components
              usually constructed in  current practice.  Because of their  potential uses,
              such  components are subject to the most rigorous  possible  scrutiny,
              including applying formal methods of specification and  proof of correctness.  
               This project investigates two key issues involved in  applying  formal methods
              to construction and use of generic components:  (1) the  need for a formal
              specification language and related  tools that fully support  behavioral
              abstraction, and (2) the need  to deal with practically useful  components, in
              which efficiency  as well as generality is a key concern.  The  language and
              tools  issue is being addressed by development of the Tecton  concept 
              description language, its proof theory, and a Tecton parser,   type-checker and
              semantic processor (for generating proof  obligations);   these tools  are
              integrated into a previously  developed interactive proof system.  The 
              usefulness issue is  addressed by developing formal concepts and models in 
              Tecton for  highly optimized algorithms, such as generic sorting and  searching
               algorithms taken from a C++ generic library.
