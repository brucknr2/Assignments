Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation award will support a study of the                     
              transport properties of cartilage using fluorescent tracers.                   
              Macroscopic transport quantities will be measured and related to               
              theoretical models that encompass the molecular components and                 
              structures of cartilage.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research is important since it will demonstrate the use of a              
              new method to make non-destructive measurements on live tissues.               
              The study also will contribute to the understanding of normal and              
              abnormal transport processes and how this may be involved in                   
              maintaining normal tissue function and developing synthetic                    
              cartilage substitutes.
