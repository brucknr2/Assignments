Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop an analytical framework              
              for analyzing and better understanding the transition of the                   
              centrally planed Eastern Europe economies to a market oriented                 
              system.  The adjustment process has been going on now for three                
              years, and there is a better understanding of the dynamics of                  
              change in Eastern Europe.  While many state firms have gone out                
              of business altogether, others are struggling to remain in                     
              operation often clamoring for state subsidies to keep them                     
              afloat.  At this point it appears that most state firms have not               
              been able to begin the kind of restructuring required to make                  
              them efficient and productive enterprises.  The proximate cause                
              of this has been lack of progress on meaningful privatization.                 
              As a result unemployment throughout the region has increased                   
              dramatically because  privatization has not proceeded quickly                  
              enough to  offset declines in public the sector industries.  This              
              project is important because it will develop a much needed                     
              analytical framework for assessing policy options for attaining                
              needed reform.
