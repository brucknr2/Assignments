Abstract    :
              Li         To achieve the best possible estimation performance with an  antenna
              array, signal processing algorithms must consider both  sensor and wave
              properties, and exploit the advantages of these  properties.  The main
              objectives of this research are:  1.     to exploit the advantages of different
              polarization  sensitive arrays;  2.     to develop the direction and
              polarization estimation  techniques for both completely and partially polarized
              waves; and  3.     to take into account the mutual coupling effects between 
              antenna sensors for direction and polarization estimation and for  modeling
              nearby scatters with antenna theory.         The algorithms are being applied
              to both simulated and  experimental data from industrial and government
              sources.  The  performance of the algorithms are being evaluated for both types
               of data.
