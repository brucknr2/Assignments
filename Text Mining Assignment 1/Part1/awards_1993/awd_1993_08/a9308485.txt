Abstract    :
              9308485  Pugh    Bis(rotaxane) monomers and polyrotaxane networks based on 
              oxyethylene repeat units will be synthesized. This is a new  topology for both
              monomers and polymer networks.  Comparison of  statistical and directed
              threading under standard conditions, as  well as under conditions which induce
              hydrophobic and solvophobic  interactions will provide a through study of the
              extent of  threading the bis(macrocrown ether)s to form monomers and polymer 
              networks.  The extent of threaded vs. dangling macrocrown ethers  will be
              determined from model systems containing hydrolyzable  crosslinks.  Absolute
              molecular weight of the linear polyrotaxane  precursors and hydrolyzed products
              will be determined.  Previously  undetermined solution properties of linear
              polyrotaxanes, including  size, shape and second virial coefficients, will be
              determined by  micro-batch light scattering measurements.    The non-covalent
              nature of the bicyclic crosslinks should provide  the networks with maximum
              microscopic mobility, and at the same  time, maintain the macroscopic shape. 
              This structural design  should therefore result in an amorphous network of low
              glass  transition temperatures.  The polyrotaxane networks will be  composed
              almost exclusively of oxyethylene repeat units, which is  the optimum chemical
              structure for ion mobility in polymer  electrolytes.  The minimal topological
              constraints could  potentially result in polymer electrolytes with unusually
              high room  temperature ionic conductivities.  Solid polymer electrolytes are 
              of interest for chemical sensors and devices, and for thin film  battery
              applications, including expensive uses such as laptop  computers, pace makers
              and electric automobiles.  ***
