Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to do the research and development necessary                   
              to prepare trial instructional materials on microscopy and                     
              microscopes, how they work and how they used to answer                         
              questions in different fields of science K-12 schools.  The                    
              intent of this proposal is to develop a preliminary teaching                   
              guide and kit (a test module)which provides an integrated                      
              constructivists approach to science learning by using the                      
              microscope to discover knowledge in life, earth and physical                   
              sciences.  The materials will be developed in collaboration                    
              with the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, California.                     
              A unique opportunity is available to test the materials with                   
              the Excellence in Teaching Elementary Science (EXCITES)                        
              Program within is an NSF funded project to be held at the                      
              University of California at Davis during the summer of 1993.                   
              The project includes a follow-up fall workshop for revisions                   
              and additional development, with continued participation and                   
              testing by the EXCITES teachers in the summers of 1994 and                     
              1995.  This phase of the project will culminate with a                         
              curriculum guide which has been tested for three years and                     
              ready for national distribution.
