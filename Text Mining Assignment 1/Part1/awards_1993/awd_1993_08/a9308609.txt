Abstract    :
              Combettes         The goal of this research is to lay a theoretical and 
              computational foundation for the use of parallel projection  methods in set
              theoretic signal/image restoration and  reconstruction.  Its main motivation is
              to overcome the  shortcomings of the Method of Successive Projections (MOSP,
              POCS  in the Convex case) that currently prevail in the field: MOSP is  not
              well suited for implementation on parallel processors due to  its serial
              structure; it provides poor solutions if the sets do  not intersect
              (inconsistent formulations); and it converges  slowly and there is no general
              rule for adapting the relaxation  coefficients to speed up the iterations.     
                 A general Method Of Parallel Projections (MOPP) is being  developed in which
              the current iterate is projected  simultaneously onto selected sets and the
              update is a relaxed  convex combination of the projections.  Research
              objectives  include, a formal study of the convergence properties of MOPP for 
              convex and nonconvex, as well as for the consistent and  inconsistent
              formulations; development of iteration-dependent,  extrapolated overrelaxations
              to achieve very fast convergence;  and investigation of the practical and
              computational issues  pertaining to signal/image recovery applications.
