Abstract    :
              CTS-9308164  Polytechnic University  Nitash P. Balsara    ABSTRACT       The
              principal objective of this research is to understand the  thermodynamic
              properties and phase behavior of ternary blends of  polymethylbutene,
              polyethylene, and polymethylbutene-polyethylene  block copolymers.  Theories
              suggest the possible formation of  complex fluids containing tubular and
              lamellar dispersed phases.   Time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering and
              light-scattering  measurements will be employed to determine microstructure as
              well  as the evolution of phase separation.     Polyolefins are among the
              foremost products in the petrochemical  industry and are used to make many
              plastic materials.  New  knowledge and new materials composed of ternary blends
              could  improve the properties of current polyolefin products or extend  their
              use for new applications.
