Abstract    :
              9308081  Norpoth    This doctoral dissertation research project examines the two
              stages  of voting decisions in presidential elections.  Electoral 
              participation is of critical importance in both democratic theory  and policy
              reform proposals, and has been extensively studied.   While much of the past
              electoral research has acknowledged the two  steps of participation in the
              United States, registration and then  actually going to the polls, few have
              modeled these two stages  explicitly.  Considering nonvoters as a unitary group
              in a single  model may have serious implications for model specification and
              the  conclusions which have been drawn, because as Merriam and Gosnell 
              demonstrated, "entirely different reasons (for not voting) were  emphasized by
              those who were registered than by those who were  registered but did not vote."
                   This research first examines the three distinct groups of the  electorate
              (non-registrants, registered nonvoters, and registered  voters), for
              comparisons across a number of demographic and  attitudinal variables.  The
              next phase of research translates the  two stage conceptualization into an
              appropriate selection bias  model of turnout.  Finally, the conclusions of past
              research about  the effects of easing registration requirements will be
              re-examined  in the properly constructed two stage model.  This research agenda
               presents a different analytic approach to the accepted  conceptualization of
              turnout which will aid in understanding  electoral frameworks, policy impact
              analysis and the interpretation  of recent history.  ***
