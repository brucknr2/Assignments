Abstract    :
                9305739  Foxman, Bruce    This award from the Chemistry Research
              Instrumentation Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Brandeis
              University in the purchase of  an x-ray diffractometer and an associated data
              analysis system. This new instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a
              number of  areas including the following:    1)  Solid state reactions of metal
              complexes,  2)  Sterically encumbered ligands,  3)  The conformational analysis
              of type I and type II  SYMBOL 98 \f "Symbol" -turns in model polypeptides,  4) 
              Ion pair structures,  5)  Applications of organometallic chemistry to materials
              science and organic synthesis.  From molecular wires to enantioselective
              reagents,  6)  Development of new synthetic methods and their application to
              total synthesis.    %%%  The x-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and
              precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule. 
              The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and
              bond angles of  a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the
              spatial arrangement of  that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.

              of imaging plate x-ray data.          The time required to collect a set of
              x-ray diffraction data sets is often the limiting factor in a diffraction
              experiment.  Reduction in data collection time by an order of magnitude or more
              is possible with area detectors.  This will greatly facilitate the work
              summarized above.
