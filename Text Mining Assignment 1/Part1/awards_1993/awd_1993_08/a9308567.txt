Abstract    :
               Sequencing by Hybridization (SBH) is a challenging  alternative to the
              classical DNA sequencing methods.  Remarkable growth of interest in SBH has
              already led to  building the first sequencing chip, reading the first 100 bp 
              by SBH and developing a photolithographic technique for  building high-capacity
              sequencing chips.  Some unsolved  computer science problems seriously slow down
              the  development of biochemical and instrumentation aspects of  SBH.  In close
              collaboration with biology and  instrumentation SBH groups, the following
              computer science  problems have been identified and are addressed by this
              project:  (a) algorithms for sequence reconstruction by optimized  chips, (b)
              algorithms to optimally choose additional biochemical  experiments for SBH, (c)
              algorithms to eliminate ``blind''   choice of PCR primers by SBH data and
              reduce the amount of   conventional sequencing in molecular evolution studies,
              and  (d) algorithms to combine small-scale SBH and primer walking   DNA
              sequencing and to parallelize ordered sequencing strategies.
