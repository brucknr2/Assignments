Abstract    :
              9308124  Yu    A challenging task in molecular engineering is to synthesize 
              multifunctional materials that exhibit predetermined chemical and  physical
              properties.  We will extend the scope of the so-called  Stille reaction as a
              new methodology to synthesize multifunctional  polymers.  The materials we are
              seeking include those with  properties of liquid crystallinity/electroactivity,
               electroactivity/second order/third order optical nonlinearity, and 
              conductivity/photoconductivity/photorefractivity.  Two goals will  be achieved
              by the proposed research:  1) conceptually new  materials will be synthesized
              and their physical properties will be  studied by using state-of-the art
              instruments; 2) novel  polymerization methodology will be developed.  ***
