Abstract    :
                      9308532  Haghi  A theoretical framework is developed for constitutive 
              equations and failure criteria for a material whose properties are  nonuniform,
              and are characterized by distribution functions.   Evolution equations are
              derived for the distribution functions  based on different models of how the
              body's parts interact with one  another, such as the equal strains (or Taylor)
              model, and compared  with full finite element calculations.    A set of
              experiments will be conducted on Lead specimens with  precise arrangements of
              embedded spherical voids, at high  homologous temperatures typical of hot
              working operations.  These  experiments will systematically examine the effect
              of the  distribution of porosity on ductile fracture.  ***
