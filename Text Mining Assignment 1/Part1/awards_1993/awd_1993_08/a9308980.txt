Abstract    :
              9308980  Segnan    This one-year award supports U.S.-Italy cooperation between
              Romeo  Segnan, American University, and Drs. Gianfranco Albanese and  Cesare
              Bucci, University of Parma, Italy.  They will perform  detailed Mossbauer
              Effect (ME) measurements in rare-earth-iron  compounds that exhibit huge
              magnetoelastic interactions.    Magnetostriction processes cannot be explained
              easily by  currently available models and theories.  It is possible that the 
              proposed Mossbauer Effect studies will provide the data and the  information
              that will elucidate this problem.  There may be  technological benefits as well
              in fields such as active vibration  control and precision machining, where
              large forces and small  displacements are required.    The Mossbauer
              measurements will be performed at the University of  Parma and will complement
              the magnetization and magnetostriction  measurements carried out in the U.S. at
              the Naval Surface Warfare  Center (NSWC).  This laboratory will provide samples
              of the  desired composition for the collaboration.  Dr. Segnan, who has  worked
              extensively in Mossbauer spectroscopy, has collaborated at  NSWC in
              magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostriction  measurements.  The Parma
              group is known for its research in  Mossbauer spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic
              resonance, and hyperfine  interactions.  * * *
