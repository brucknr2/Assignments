Abstract    :
                9308332  Trolier-McKinstry    This is a Research Planning Grant (RPG) proposal
              submitted  to the Research Opportunity for Women (ROW) Program.  The  proposed
              work uses the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) as a  nondestructive
              characterization tool for thin film and  graded refractive index transparent
              materials.  The limits  of sensitivity of the measuring techniques will be 
              investigated.  The absolute accuracy of the measured film  refractive index
              will be calculated as a function of the  measured film thickness and the
              refractive index contrast  between the coating and the substrate.  Quantitative
               correlations between film deposition conditions and the film  qualities will
              be made.  It can have the effect of  facilitating the production of homogeneous
              and high-quality  films.  %%%  This proposed work uses the spectroscopic
              ellipsometry (SE)  as a nondestructive characterization tool for thin film and 
              graded refractive index transparent materials.  It plans to  examine the limits
              of sensitivity of the measurements, and  it seeks to separate the effect of
              microstructural  inhomogeneities in the films from the actual optical 
              properties of the material.   Transparent films are  important in this age  of
              optical communications. This study provides quantitative  measures in how to
              improve the qualities of the films. Its'  potentials to improve the optical
              communication application  are very great.  ***
