Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              When companies purchase computerized technologies, they anticipate             
              substantial improvements in organizational performance.  Some                  
              companies achieve these benefits, but others find the                          
              implementation of computerized technologies a struggle and the                 
              benefits of implementation elusive.  There is little research or               
              theory available to explain such differences in implementation                 
              effectiveness.  The proposed study of the implementation of the                
              same computerized manufacturing technology (manufacturing resource             
              planning or MRPII) in 35 plants will begin to fill this gap.  The              
              research design holds the technology constant across plants,                   
              allowing a rigorous assessment of the impact of organizational                 
              characteristics and processes on the outcomes of technology                    
              implementation.  These organizational characteristics and processes            
              include climate for technology implementation, financial resource              
              availability, and upward communication within in each plant.                   
              Implementation outcomes include employee use and acceptance of the             
              technology and improvements in plant performance as a result of                
              technology implementation.  Survey data will be gathered from an               
              average of 40 plant employees (plant management, implementation                
              team members, and technology users) in each plant to test                      
              hypotheses regarding implementation effectiveness.  The study                  
              includes a longitudinal component, with plant management assessing             
              changes in plant performance as a result of technology                         
              implementation at two times, one year apart.  //
