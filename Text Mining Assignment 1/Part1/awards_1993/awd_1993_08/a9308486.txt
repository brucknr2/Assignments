Abstract    :
                      9308486  Laursen  The purpose of this research initiation award (RIA) is
              to conduct  research on the application of finite element methods to problems 
              involving frictional mechanical contact of bodies undergoing large  inelastic
              deformations.  This investigation will explore the  efficient implementation
              within finite element codes of physically  motivated constitutive models for
              friction in order to  realistically simulate such events of interest as
              forming, cutting  and machining processes, the behavior of orthopedic joint 
              replacements, plate tectonics and fault slippage.  ***
