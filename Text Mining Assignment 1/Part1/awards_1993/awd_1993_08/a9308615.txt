Abstract    :
                  9308615  Backus    Two of the outstanding issues in international
              macroeconomics  concern the variability of relative prices (why are real
              exchange  rats so volatile?) and the absence of international capital  mobility
              (why is there so little international borrowing and  lending?).  Neither of
              these features of international economies  is predicted by standard dynamic
              general equilibrium theory.  The  purpose of this project is to look more
              closely at the evidence  and assess four extensions of the theory designed to
              explain  these two features of the world economy, with particular emphasis  on
              price variability.  The extensions of the theory are  especially valuable
              because they improve measures of the welfare  consequences of government
              policies that influence relative price  flexibility and international capital
              mobility.     The extensions incorporate, respectively, incomplete markets, 
              limited enforceability of foreign loans, fixed costs of changing  export
              capacity, and wage/price inertia into a general  equilibrium setting, where
              prices and quantities are both  explained.  The theory is developed in a form
              that makes  comparison with data relatively straightforward.  Each  theoretical
              extension will be evaluated with regard to its  ability to mimic observed
              fluctuations in relative prices and  international capital flows.   ***
