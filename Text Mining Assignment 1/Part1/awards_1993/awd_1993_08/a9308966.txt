Abstract    :
               This research explores three aspects of algorithmic  techniques,  partitioning
              schemes and fault-tolerance schemes   of parallel  algorithms by designing and
              implementing several classes of  algorithms on the  CM-5 parallel machine.  The
              motivation for this  project is in developing a  methodology for the design and
               implementation of fast, efficient, and robust  parallel algorithms  for
              scalable multicomputers.  In the context of algorithmic  techniques, the
              results of the research enable the designer  to choose  between synchronous and
              asynchronous algorithms, and  allow the designer to use  different techniques,
              such as iterative  and divide-and-conquer, at different  levels of a parallel 
              algorithm.  The research also identifies the tradeoffs  among  various
              partitioning schemes for a given application.  In the  context of 
              fault-tolerance techniques, the research shows how  to exploit the 
              fault-tolerance inherent in iterative algorithms,  and devise suitable 
              fault-tolerance schemes for applications such  as solving partial differential 
              equations.  Preliminary results,  obtained from implementations on the CM-5 
              machine, indicate that  asynchronous iterative algorithms achieve speedups over
               their  synchronous counterparts, and that several divide-and-conquer 
              algorithms  can be implemented efficiently on the CM-5 parallel  machine.  As
              part of this  project, many subproblems that are  specific to the CM-5 system
              are  formulated and solved.
