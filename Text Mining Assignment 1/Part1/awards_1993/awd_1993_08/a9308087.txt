Abstract    :
              9308087  Plonus  The extended Huygens-Fresnel principle is used to investigate
              superresolution effects in weak turbulence.  Fundamental, analytical
              expressions for the average image spectrum of an extended object under
              monochromatic, unit amplitude plane wave illumination have been developed, and
              are the basis of this proposal.  These expressions show that under certain
              conditions the superresolution effect can be observed.  The criterion and
              physical model of superresolution effect will be established.  The relationship
              between various parameters, such as:  wavelength, strength of turbulence, the
              diameter of aperture lens, etc. will be investigated.  The more general problem
              of superresolution effect in imaging through weak turbulence while the object
              is illuminated by a spatially partially coherent source will be explored.  The
              effect of the degree of illuminating source coherence on superresolution will
              be investigated.  The superresolution effect associated with look-up and
              look-down imaging system will be analyzed.  The superresolution recovery
              techniques and procedures will be derived to extract the additional information
              contained in the image spectrum.  Through this development, a clear picture of
              the superresolution effect caused by turbulent inhomogeneities will be
              established, which would lead to an introduction in the object image of some
              new features.  ***
