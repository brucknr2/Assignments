Abstract    :
              9308205  Weichman  This proposal concerns the understanding of phase transitions
              where  quantum mechanics is important. The work is mainly analytical in  nature
              based mainly upon renormalization group methods. The PI will  consider two
              types of system: 1) Phase transitions at T=0 driven  entirely by quantum
              fluctuations. Examples include superfluidity  and superconductivity in
              disordered systems with special emphasis  on understanding properties of the
              recently proposed Bose and  vortex glass phase transitions. 2) Phase
              transitions at T>0 driven  by thermal fluctuations but in which quantum
              fluctuations still  play a significant role. Examples include phase transitions
              in 2D  dipolar ferromagnets; superfluidity of 4He in porous media and the 
              superfluid-normal phase interface of 4He under gravity.  %%%  This work
              concerns issues in our understanding of phase transitions  at very low
              temperatures where fluctuations of quantum degrees of  freedom drive the
              transition - rather than the usual, higher  temperature cases where thermal
              fluctuations are the important  factors. The work will concentrate on systems
              of current  experimental interest such as thin film superconductors and helium 
              superfluidity in porous media and under gravity. This type of work  on phase
              transitions is state-of-the-art in low temperature  condensed matter theory.
