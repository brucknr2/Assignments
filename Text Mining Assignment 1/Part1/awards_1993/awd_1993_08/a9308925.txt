Abstract    :
              9308925  DeBrunner  The goal of this project is to investigate the use of 
              multiple bases representations of digitized speech signals  to improve the
              performance of speech enhancement and speech  syntheses systems.  In the past 
              it has been shown that the  use of several basis sets simultaneously provides
              better  energy packing than a single basis set for speech  compression systems.
               This research will determine the  quality of reconstructed speech using
              multiple bases  decompositions with the overall objective of improving the 
              performance of digital hearing aids.  The proposed technique  will be compared
              to sinusoidal model based algorithms and  traditional noise suppression and
              cancellation techniques.    This research is important since it has the
              potential to  advance the fields of speech enhancement, speech synthesis  and
              speech recognition as well as provide useful results  that could be used to
              design new digital hearing aids.  ***
