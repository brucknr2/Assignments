Abstract    :
              9308666  Ferrand  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which
              is to develop effective  approaches to accommodating the influence  that
              natural heterogeneity of soils has on  the movement of non-aqueous phase
              liquids  through them.  The investigator plans on  conducting her experiments
              in relatively  large-scale, laboratory soil flumes packed  with heterogeneous
              soils.  Fluid saturations  and pressures will be monitored and recorded  by
              time-domain reflectometry and  tensiometer/transducer systems to establish 
              spatially-averaged steady-state and transient  relationships of the fluids
              moving through  the soils.  Coarse-grid simulations of the  experiment will be
              performed to determine the  best way in which these relationships can be  used
              to accurately predict fluid  displacements.    The proposal leading to this
              award was  submitted in response to NSF 92-122, Research  Initiation Awards
              Program Announcement and  Guidelines.  Results are expected to improve  models
              used in engineering design of  remediation processes and systems for 
              decontamination of contaminated soils.
