Abstract    :
              This project develops new procedures for estimating non-linear                 
              models of "long-memory" processes, that is relationships between               
              values over long periods.  These new procedures can be applied to              
              many questions in macro, financial and labor economics.  They are              
              particularly relevant for modelling relationships between                      
              macroeconomic and weather variables, as when studying global                   
              warming for instance, as these variables are certainly slowly                  
              moving and the relationships are likely to be non-linear.                      
                                                                                             
              Work concerning long memory processes has largely been linear.                 
              There are many non-linear modelling techniques available to                    
              approximate actual relationships but these procedures usually                  
              assume, either explicitly or implicitly, that the variables are                
              stationary, or short-memory.  In order to provide a class of                   
              techniques  appropriate for modelling non-linear relationships                 
              between long variables, this project will develop new definitions              
              and tests of long-memory in the non-linear framework and specify               
              new techniques for testing for linearity and for overcoming the                
              "data-missing" properties of some of the techniques.
