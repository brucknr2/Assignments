              develop complete, systematic, robust and high performance methodologies for
              multirate sampled data systems that take directly into account the hybrid
              nature of the problem.  More specifically, the modern, robust control         ?
                    design methodologies of H infinity and l   1    are established for the
              hybrid multirate problem.  In addition, stability robustness and performance
              robustness non conservative criteria, which can be directly incorporated into
              the design process, are provided for the hybrid multirate system.  Furthermore,
              the case of asynchronous sampling is investigated in the hybrid multirate
              framework and analysis and synthesis tools emerge.  The above results are
              integrated into user friendly computer software in order to be easily used in
              multirate applications.  Finally, an inherently multirate experiment, where
              computer vision is utilized for feedback to the motion control system of a two
              link direct drive, is used for testing and evaluating the analytical
              developments. ***
