Abstract    :
              9308148  Perepezko     This research explores kinetics of heterogeneous
              nucleation in  undercooled liquid metal alloys.  The approach to the kinetics 
              evaluation follows two directions: experimental measurement and  computer
              simulation.  Droplet samples from the tin-antimony alloy  system are emulsified
              in a stable carrier fluid and undercooled.   Nucleation events during
              undercooling are followed by calorimetry  and the droplet size distribution and
              volume phase fraction  determined by quantitative image analysis.  Kinetic and 
              thermodynamic results are related to the microstructure and  composition of the
              solidified droplets by employing scanning  electron microscopy, energy
              dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray  diffraction.  Computer simulation employs
              the Kinetic Monte Carlo  method and addresses critical nucleus size, shape
              factors, and  nucleation at moving boundaries as a function of time.  %%% 
              Nucleation is a physical phenomena of broad occurrence, playing an  important
              role in metallic, ceramic, organic, biological, and  aqueous systems.  New
              insights should result from this research  applicable to these systems.   ***
