Abstract    :
              Athanas         A new processing platform and high-level compiler are being 
              developed that will significantly improve program execution  times.  Typical
              computationally intensive programs tend to spend  nearly all of their execution
              time within a small fraction of the  compiled executable code.  Efforts to
              improve the performance of  these tasks are best rewarded when focused on these
              frequently  accessed portions.  The new hardware and software will allow the 
              configuration and fundamental operations of a core processing  platform to
              adapt to the computationally intensive portions of a  targeted application. 
              The high-level language compiler is  responsible for identifying the
              computationally dominant portions  of an application, and for synthesizing
              hardware structures that  can be dynamically loaded into the processing
              platform for  subsequent execution.  A general-purpose platform embracing these
               principles can reap the performance benefits of application-  specific
              processors, and also retain a general purpose nature by  accommodating a wide
              variety of tasks.  Furthermore, computer  architectures that adopt these
              techniques may become a cost-  effective alternative to conventional
              high-performance computing  platforms.
