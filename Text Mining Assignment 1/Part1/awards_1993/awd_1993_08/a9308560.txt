Abstract    :
              9308560  ABBOTT  This project will develop and employ a new methodolgy for
              analyzing  criminal careers across individual lives.  The project will result 
              in a sequential picture of life events from childhood to adulthood  in four
              dimensions -- crime, criminal justice sanctions (e.g.,  arrest, incarceration),
              employment and marriage.  Based on an age-  graded theory of social control,
              the focus is on how the sequencing  of sanctioning, employment and marital
              events are related to  changes and turning points in the criminal career.  A
              major  hypothesis is that sequences of incarceration followed by job 
              instability produce distinct turning points toward crime.  By  developing and
              extending new optimal-matching methods for detecting  resemblance in sequence
              data, the project seeks to establish  whether or not there are critical stages
              of the life course that  turn criminal careers in particular directions.     
              The data for this project stem from a classic longitudinal study  (by Sheldon
              and Eleanor Glueck) of 500 delinquents and 500  nondelinquents followed from
              adolescence to age 32.  These data  will be reconstructed by the research team
              for the purpose of this  new kind of analysis.  Life records of the sequencing
              of job and  marital histories will be coded and analyzed in conjunction with 
              more recent data on criminal careers up to age 45.  The proposed  methodology
              of "optimal matching" aims to detect distinct patterns  of crime associated
              with salient events over the course of life.  ***
