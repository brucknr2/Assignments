Abstract    :
               Computationally simulating complex physical systems in  engineering design has
              become a common practice.  Yet most of  today's simulations rely on extensive
              numerical computations.  Nonlinear physical systems can exhibit extremely
              complex  behaviors that defy human analysis and pure numerical  simulations. 
              The analysis and design for these systems are  limited by the available
              computational power and the system  complexities.  This research project will
              develop powerful computer  simulation technologies for the analysis and design
              of  nonlinear control systems.  Programmable primitives will be  developed for
              constructing simulations and synthesizing   high-performance controllers. 
              Hybrid computation will be   for integrating symbolic and numerical methods
              with AI  reasoning and representation techniques in (1) manipulating  and
              visualizing the dynamics of physical systems based on a  phase-space
              representation, and (2) guiding the execution of  numerical computations.  The
              expected results of this   is to expand the scope of what current numerical
              simulation  programs or state-of-the-art knowledge-based systems can do  
              solving pressing scientific and engineering problems.
