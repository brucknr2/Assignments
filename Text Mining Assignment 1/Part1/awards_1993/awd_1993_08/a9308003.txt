Abstract    :
              The importance of formal methods for ensuring extreme high                     
              reliability requirements of safety and mission critical                        
              systems is widely known, but mature formal methods for                         
              concurrent and distributed systems are still lacking.                          
              Hierarchical predicate transition nets for system                              
              specifications and temporal logic techniques for analyzing                     
              predicate transition nets have recently been developed.                        
              This research furthers previous work with the following                        
              objectives:  1) to define an algebraic semantics of                            
              hierarchical predicate transition nets in order to carry out                   
              various algebraic transformations; 2) to design a more                         
              usable and powerful specification methodology to facilitate                    
              the practical applications of hierarchical predicate                           
              transition nets to realworld systems; 3) to develop a                          
              variety of effective analysis techniques to ensure the                         
              correctness of hierarchical predicate transition net                           
              specifications.  This research represents a significant step                   
              towards a solid understanding of hierarchical predicate                        
              transition nets and their relationship with other                              
              specification methods and will lay the foundation of a new                     
              and effective formal specification and verification                            
              methodology for concurrent and distributed systems based on                    
              hierarchical predicate transition nets.
