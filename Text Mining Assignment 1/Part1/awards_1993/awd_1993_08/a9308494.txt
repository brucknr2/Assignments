Abstract    :
                9308494  Vrbsky    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.  A real-time system has specific time constraints for the processing  of
              a database query as well as consistency requirements for its  temporal data. 
              If it is not possible to produce an exact answer to  a database query by a
              specified deadline, approximate query  processing can be used to provide an
              approximate answer within the  time constraints, but it does not address the
              temporal dimension of  the data.  This project integrates the two areas of
              approximate  query processing and temporal data models in order to design an 
              approximate query processing system for temporal data.  A new  semantics of
              approximation is being developed to include the  different types of temporal
              data and consistency requirements of a  real-time database.  The approximate
              relational algebra operations  are extended to include new approximate temporal
              operations.  The  semantic information needed during approximate query
              processing to  incorporate the temporal dimension and maintain consistency is 
              being determined.  The result of this project will provide a design  for the
              implementation of an approximate query processing system  that can be used in
              environments where data consistency must be  maintained and deadlines must be
              met.   ***
