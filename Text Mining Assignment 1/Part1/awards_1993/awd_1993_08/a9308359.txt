Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS 9308359  Prescott    Funding is requested from NSF to support
              the initiation of a research program aimed at improving the understanding of
              convective transport phenomena during solid-liquid phase change of binary metal
              alloys.  Since the transport of momentum, heat, and species strongly influence
              the metallurgical structure, chemical homogeneity, formation of voids, and
              entrapment of inclusions in solidified materials, improvements in phase change
              processes depend on having a detailed understanding of the attendant transport
              phenomena.  Binary solid-liquid phase change processes are further complicated
              by coupling between micro- and macro-scale phenomena which is to be examined in
              the proposed project.  A combined experimental and theoretical approach is
              proposed to study transport phenomena in metal alloys.  The experimental
              portion of the study will utilize neutron radiography to perform
              post-experimental chemical analyses of ingot sections, as well as to obtain
              real-time records of species redistribution during phase change.  The
              theoretical portion of the study will involve numerical computations based on a
              continuum model to account for stochastic behavior of the two phase (mushy)
              region and non-equilibrium effects, such as undercooling and recalescence.
