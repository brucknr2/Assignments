Abstract    :
               The project implements a virtual-memory system for  data-parallel  computing by
              taking advantage of the technical advances   in algorithms for parallel disk
              systems.    Such a system will  benefit parallel computing in many scientific 
              and other application areas by  making it simpler and faster to  run code on
              objects that are several gigabytes  or even larger.  Typically, when the memory
              requirements of an application  exceed  the available random-access memory on
              parallel machines,  programmers  keep their data on a parallel disk system and
              perform  disk accesses in their  source code.  The resulting codes are 
              difficult to develop and often run  slowly.  The proposed system  will help
              avoid the additional software  development time and  complexity associated with
              such large problems.  Moreover,  because the system employs recent advances in
              algorithms for  planning  parallel disk accesses, it runs more efficiently.   
              The project entails  the design and implementation of an  appropriate set of
              primitive data-parallel  operations in a  virtual-memory context.  The
              implementation may include further  development of efficient algorithms for
              parallel disk systems.  In addition, the  project includes the development of
              one or  more compilers that compile  languages such as Fortran and C into 
              these primitives.
