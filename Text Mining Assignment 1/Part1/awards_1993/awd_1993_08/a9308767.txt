Abstract    :
              In accordance with an Agreement between NSF and NOAA, an                       
              interagency transfer of funds will establish a project office to               
              manage and advance planning activities in support of the Inter-                
              American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI).  An Agreement             
              establishing the Institute was signed 13 May 1992 by the U.S. and              
              ten additional countries.  IAI will become operational once six                
              countries have ratified and signed the Agreement.  The IAI                     
              initiative was launched by the U.S. and there is a high level of               
              interest in supporting coordinated science activities with                     
              developing countries in the Western Hemisphere.  A project office              
              is essential to the successful coordination of science planning,               
              education, and training activities, especially in light of the                 
              broad, interdisciplinary research agenda envisioned for the                    
              Institute.  This funding action will establish a cooperative                   
              agreement between NSF/GEO and NOAA/Office of Global Programs (OGP)             
              for the joint management of the project office that will be located            
              at NOAA.
