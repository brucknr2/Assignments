Abstract    :
              This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop                  
              custom assist devices for persons with disabilities.  A group of               
              students and the investigators on the grant will work with health              
              care personnel and patients at the Rehabilitation Unit of the                  
              Medical College of Ohio on these projects.  Six projects per year              
              will be executed and written reports on the completed projects                 
              will be submitted for an annual publication.                                   
                                                                                             
              This type of undertaking is important since not only will it                   
              provide meaningful projects for engineering students to complete               
              as part of their undergraduate design requirements, but it will                
              also benefit a population where customization is often needed for              
              rehabilitation devices.
