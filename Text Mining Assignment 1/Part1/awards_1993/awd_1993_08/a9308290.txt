Abstract    :
              9308290 Duenyas          In the past decade, there has been a growing research
              interest in queueing network models of manufacturing systems.  This interest is
              due to the ability of queueing network models to capture and evaluate the
              effects of variability and congestion.  The recent interest in pull
              manufacturing systems such as kanban has increased the use of queueing network
              models.  However, an important feature of many manufacturing systems that has
              not yet been satisfactorily incorporated in queueing network models is assembly
              operations.  Assembly operations are operations that require as input the
              output of several different production lines.          The aim of this project
              is to develop analytical models for the analysis and control of assembly
              systems.  Bounds and approximations will be developed for such performance
              measures as the throughput, variance of the number produced in a given period, 
              mean and variance of cycle  time and mean and variance of queue lengths.  Our
              preliminary results indicate that approximating assembly systems by equivalent
              tandem systems provides  a promising appraoch.  The analytical models will be
              used in algorithms for the optimal design of assembly systems.  We will answer
              design questions such as how work should be allocated between different lines 
              ad work centers, how to set production quotas, and Work In Process Inventory
              levels in these systems and how variability affects the optimal design and
              performance of assembly systems.  The researchers will  work with industry to
              test and implement our results.  The result of the research will aid
              manufacturers signficantly in designing more efficient assembly systems.
