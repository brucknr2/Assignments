Abstract    :
                   Neural network technology has the potential to solve an                   
              impressive variety of today's technological problems which                     
              conventional computers are quite powerless to deal with.  The first            
              applications of neural networks technology have been limited to                
              relatively small problems, and therefore systems scaling was not a             
              primary issue.  Neural networks for real-life problems usually                 
              consist of a large numbers of interconnected processors working in             
              parallel.  The objective of this proposal is a deeper investigation            
              into the computational and learning abilities of neural networks               
              for such large scale problems.  In particular, the computational               
              models and topologies best suited for large scale problems, and                
              efficient and accurate learning techniques for such resource-                  
              bounded parallel machine will be investigated.  The results will be            
              evaluated on two challenging real-life problems from electrical                
              engineering and molecular biology (mixed-signal integrated circuits            
              testing and protein structure prediction).  The proposed work is               
              based on recent results:  (1) a discrete multivalued neural                    
              networks model that can be used as a tool for reasoning about the              
              computational scaling abilities of various neural network                      
              architectures; (2) efficient neural network learning algorithms                
              that generalize well starting with pre-existing symbolic knowledge             
              and incorporating additional constructive learning from examples.//
