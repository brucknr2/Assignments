Abstract    :
              Flexible AC Transmission Systems                                               
              (FACT) are being studied by the                                                
              electric utility industry for                                                  
              increasing the transmission                                                    
              capability of the existing                                                     
              infrastructure while maintaining or                                            
              increasing security and quality                                                
              levels.  Most studies are concerned                                            
              with the use of thyristor switched                                             
              circuits.  Currently these systems                                             
              have to be custom designed,                                                    
              basically due to the thyristor's                                               
              inherent need for natural turn-off,                                            
              manifesting itself as harmonic                                                 
              interactions between the switching                                             
              system and the power system.  These                                            
              interactions are not well                                                      
              understood.  In order to eliminate                                             
              such problems, the use of power                                                
              converters with gate turn-off                                                  
              switches has been proposed.                                                    
              However, the power levels reachable                                            
              with these are limited by the power                                            
              semiconductor and power converter                                              
              technology.  This current study                                                
              investigates a hybrid approach                                                 
              which aims to achieve the best                                                 
              features of each, i.e. high power                                              
              level and an interface free of                                                 
              harmonic interaction.
