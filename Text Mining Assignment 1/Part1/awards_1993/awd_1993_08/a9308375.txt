                  93083375 Sarnelle          This research focuses on the strong interactions
              between Daphnia and algae in eutrophic lakes.  The general objectives to
              quantify the relationship between the death rate of Daphnia and total algal
              biomass to examine the role of initial conditions as a determinant of
              planktonic community structure and to quantify adaptive tradeoffs faced by
              algal species to constraints imposed by herbivory.          This research
              examines whether multiple equilibria exist in the community structure of
              eutrophic lakes, due to a reciprocal negative interaction between Daphnia and
              filamentous bluegreens.  In addition the work will identify some of the
              mechanisms underlying the above interactions, by examing adaptive tradeoffs
              faced by algal species.   %%% The presence of multiple equilibria has been
              predicated by ecological theory but rarely demostrated experimentally.  This is
              crucial to development of ecology as a predictive science since the need to
              specify initial conditions may severely contrain the ability to predict
              ecolgical phenomena.  The role of food webs in ameliorating negative effects of
              extroplication on water quality is also important to indentifying management
              targets for reducing excessive algal growth in nutrient enriched lakes via
              changes in the fish community.
