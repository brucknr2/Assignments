Abstract    :
              CTS-9308258  Johns Hopkins University  Timothy A. Barbari      ABSTRACT        
              A new approach to improve polymeric membranes for gas  separation will be
              explored in this project.  Rather than  synthesizing membranes of new materials
              or new composite  structures, chemical modification to form charge-transfer
              complexes  in various membrane polymers in current use is to be evaluated as  a
              means of augmenting their gas separation properties.  Bromination  of
              nucleophilic sites alters the free volume and free volume  distribution in
              polymers so that molecular diffusivity increases  and selectivity changes. 
              Permeabilities of CO2 and CH4 through a  treated polysulfone film will be
              measured and compared with the  untreated material.         Growth in membrane
              sales for the next few years has been  estimated at 12-15%.  A large portion of
              this market is in gas  separations to produce commercially important gaseous
              materials  including the removal of carbon dioxide from natural gas and the 
              separation of pure oxygen.
