Abstract    :
                  9308911  Larson  The research will determine the relative importance of
              interfacial  friction and interfacial toughness in maximizing crack retardation
               while minimizing the possibility of fiber failure.  The growth of  a matrix
              crack may be retarded if the fiber/matrix interface is  cohesive and/or
              adhesive.  The benefits of raising the friction  coefficient (cohesion) and
              critical energy release rate (adhesion)  must, however, be balanced against the
              potential for fiber failure  in the high stress zone near the periphery of a
              matrix crack or an  interfacial sliding zone.  The resulting guidelines for
              designing  optimal interfaces will reveal implications for arresting small 
              cracks.  The investigation will combine computational modeling in  conjunction
              with experiments on a model fibrous composite  (glass/glass).  ***
