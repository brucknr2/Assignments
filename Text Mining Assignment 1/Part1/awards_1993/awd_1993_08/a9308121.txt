Abstract    :
                   The research entails applying a number of existing methods                
              of numerical analysis to develop strategies appropriate for the                
              solution of ill-posed problems in the general area of partial                  
              differential equations.  An outcome of this investigation will be              
              the derivation of stability inequalities from which significant                
              error estimates may be obtained.  Methods of approximation and of              
              finite elements will be exploited and adapted to the classes of                
              ill-posed problems in question.
