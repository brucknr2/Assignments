Abstract    :
              9308074  Mo       This award covers experimental Elementary Particle  Physics
              Research by a group at the Virginia Polytechnic  Institute in collaboration
              with other NSF, DOE and foreign  supported scientists.  The group will continue
              their studies  of inelastic electron scattering at the DESY accelerator in 
              Hamburg, Germany.  They will also continue development and  testing of new
              phototube high voltage designs and other  electronics for use at the
              Superconducting Super Collider in  Texas.  ***
