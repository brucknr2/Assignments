Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will extend the decomposition theory                
              of 3-connected graphs in three areas.  First, classes of                       
              well-structured graphs related to a Coullard-Gardner-Wagner                    
              decomposition will be characterized by simple, well-defined                    
              replacements and excluded minor theorems.  Second, algorithmic                 
              results will be obtained on these classes.  Third, the                         
              decomposition theory of 3-connected graphs will be extended to                 
              3-connected matroids.
