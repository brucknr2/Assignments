Abstract    :
              In this study supported by a Career Advancement Award from the                 
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program of the                         
              Chemistry Division models are being developed to characterize                  
              the electronic structure and spectra of nanoscale size                         
              semiconductor crystallites such as cadmium selinide.  Special                  
              emphasis is being placed on determining the role of shapes,                    
              sizes, and surface characteristics in influencing the                          
              properties of these crystallites.  Extensive use is being made                 
              of computer codes developed for these studies.

              Tiny crystals of semiconducting materials such as cadmium                      
              selenide are very important in the development of new                          
              electronic devices.  In this study theoretical and                             
              computational methods are being developed and utilized to                      
              characterize the electronic and optical properties of these                    
              crystals.
