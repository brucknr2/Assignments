              Abstract  ATM-9308300  Shen, Glen T.  Title:  Pacific Paleoclimate from Reef
              Corals in the Eastern and  Western Margins: Records from Galapagos, Cocos
              Island and the Gulf  of Papua    This award will support a study designed to
              characterize the  paleoclimate of the eastern Pacific over the last 400 years
              using  the best available coral samples and seeks to establish a new 
              geochemical tracer in the far western Pacific - a region for which  few marine
              climatic indicators presently exist.  The foci of the  eastern Pacific
              reconstructions will be the Galapagos Islands  (0.5oS, 91oW) and Cocos Island
              (5.3oN, 86.9oW).  The ratio of  barium:calcium in coral argonite, a sensitive
              indicator of  upwelling and fluvial discharge, will be the key measurement
              using  an Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).  Records 
              spanning 270- (Cocos) and 400-years (Galapagos) length will be  produced at
              quarter-annual resolution.  Additionally, annual  determinations of Cd/Ca and
              Mn/Ca will be made .    Developmental effort for a regional precipitation index
              over  Australasia will involve determination of Ba/Ca ratios in a 100-  year
              coral core from the Gulf of Papua, an area markedly influenced  by Ba-enriched
              continental runoff.  The goal of this work is the  development of
              climatically-relevant datasets which surpass the  instrumental record in length
              yet retain the quality of latter 20th  century measurements.  Such records will
              allow a closer examination  of recurrent periods (e.g annual, biennial, and
              three-to-seven year  ENSO timescales) which appear to characterize the lower
              atmosphere  and upper ocean, and may reveal the existence of longer time scale 
              variations.
