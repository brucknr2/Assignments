Abstract    :
              Hayes  9308038  This applicant will study the relationship between steroid 
              hormones and growth and development in tadpoles.  Specifically,  he will take
              advantage of the variation in susceptibility to  steroid influences between
              different developmental stages and  between species at these stages to examine
              the role of specific  steroid receptors at the cell surface.  Comparisons will
              be made  of the levels and binding affinity of receptors in species  exhibiting
              steroidal effects and those lacking such effects.   This work will be conducted
              in the laboratory of Dr. Gary  Firestone at the University of California at
              Berkeley.  ***
