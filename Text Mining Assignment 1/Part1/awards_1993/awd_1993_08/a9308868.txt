Abstract    :
                   This research addresses the issue of automated hypothesization            
              of situation models that are needed as contexts for reasoning and              
              decision making.  The three different but related aspects that are             
              addressed by this research are:  1.  Learning from domain data the             
              qualitative relationships among domain attribute and their                     
              associated probabilistic uncertainty knowledge; 2.  Integration of             
              uncertainty knowledge and other known causal qualitative                       
              relationships of the domain into a single graphical knowledge                  
              structure; and 3.  Hypothesization of small and interesting                    
              situation models from the intermediate representation of domain                
              knowledge acquired in the preceding step.  The learning of                     
              qualitative relationships from databases is extended to include                
              acquisition of temporal dependencies among attributes, and also to             
              the cases when the available data is in the form of multi-                     
              databases.  This learning method is also sought to be applied to               
              the problem of incomplete databases.  The knowledge based dynamic              
              hypothesization of situation models is sought to be extended to                
              apply to path planning and temporal modeling problems.  The issue              
              of specifying a situation model at varying levels of precision and             
              certainty are also examined.//
