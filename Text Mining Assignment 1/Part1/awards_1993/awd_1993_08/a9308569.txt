Abstract    :
              CTS-9308569  Carnegie Mellon University  Robert D. Tilton    ABSTRACT       The
              objective of this research is to determine the mechanism of  adsorption of
              block copolymers to the surface of self-assembled  lipids at the vapor-water
              interface.  Scanning angle reflectometry  will be used to measure time-resolved
              layer thicknesses and  refractive indexes as the block copolymers adsorb. 
              Additional  experiments in a Langmuir trough focus on determining the effect 
              of the copolymer on  -A isotherms.  Kinetic and equilibrium results  from these
              and other measurements will be used to help understand  the interaction between
              the block copolymer molecules and the lipid  aggregate.     The presence of
              block copolymer amphiphiles can improve many  existing and emerging
              technologies which support a variety of  consumer products.  They help to
              inhibit lysis of red blood cells,  to reduce rupture of eucaryotic cells in
              cultures, and to stabilize  emulsions.
