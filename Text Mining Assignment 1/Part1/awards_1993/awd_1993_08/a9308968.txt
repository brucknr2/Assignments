Abstract    :
              9308968  Barry  The Principal Investigator is analyzing the potential of diffuse
               infrared radiation as a technique for use in short-range wireless 
              communication links providing network access to portable  communicators and
              portable computers.  The researcher is  investigating the fundamental
              limitations on the speed of diffuse  wireless links using infrared radiation,
              and determining which  modulation and equalization techniques are best able to
              support  high-speed communications.  The award provides support for three 
              years.
