Abstract    :
              John Walz  Abstract    The traditional methods for studying deposition of
              colloidal  particles onto solid surfaces are the rotating disc and packed bed 
              experiments.  When the results of such experiments are compared  with current
              theoretical models, substantial discrepancy is  frequently observed.  Possible
              reasons for this disagreement  include the large number of factors affecting
              the deposition rate  and the fact that the measured rate in these experiments
              represents  an average over many particles and capture sites.  This research 
              proposes a new approach to studying particle capture through the  use of two
              novel optical techniques:  total internal reflection  microscopy (TIRM) and
              radiation pressure (or "optical tweezers").   These  techniques will allow
              measurement of the deposition rate of  a single particle at a fixed position on
              a solid surface to be  taken under carefully controlled conditions.  The
              objective will be  to measure the effect of specific factors on the rate of
              particle  capture.  The experimental apparatus will be designed such that 
              ionic strength, viscosity, fluid velocity, particle size, and net  particle
              weight can be adjusted.    The results of these measurements will provide new
              insight into  deposition mechanisms applied in a large variety of industrial 
              processes.
