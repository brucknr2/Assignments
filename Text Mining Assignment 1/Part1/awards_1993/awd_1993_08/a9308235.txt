Abstract    :
              9308235  Fodor       This award provides one-half the funding required to
              modernize  two items of equipment in the Department of Marine, Earth and 
              Atmospheric Sciences at the North Carolina State University. The  institution
              is committed to providing the remaining funds needed  for the project.       An
              electron microprobe and an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer  will be upgraded.
              Both instruments are old but functioning and will  be capable of adequate
              performance for several more years as a  result of this upgrade. The electron
              microprobe is widely used in  the department as a tool for quantitative
              elemental analysis of  geological samples with a spatial resolution of a
              micrometer, and  the X-ray fluorescence system is used for bulk chemical
              analysis  of rocks and minerals. Both instruments are needed for teaching 
              purposes as well as graduate research projects requiring chemical  analyses.
