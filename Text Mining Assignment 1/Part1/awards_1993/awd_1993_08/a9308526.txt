Abstract    :
              CTS-9308526  University of Arkansas  Maria R. Coleman    ABSTRACT       Chemical
              structure will be systematically varied in a series of  polyquinolines in order
              to investigate relationships between  molecular architecture and properties of
              polymeric films and  membranes.  Structural changes will modify intersegmental
              and  intrasegmental resistances to chain mobility, the inhibitions to  chain
              packing and the distribution of free volume.  Physical and,  particularly, gas
              transport properties of these rigid, high thermal  resistance polymers will be
              measured.       Polymeric films are important barrier materials in food 
              packaging and in the microelectronics industries.  Membranes are  rapidly being
              developed and used in production facilities for fuels  and in the separation of
              gases for hospitals and research  institutes.
