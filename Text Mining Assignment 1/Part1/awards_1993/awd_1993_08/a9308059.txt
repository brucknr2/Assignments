Abstract    :
                9308059  Benning  This applicant will be acquiring a time series of Airborne
              Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data along with the field data
              necessary to develop spectral models of ecosystem function in grasslands and
              semiarid regions.  The spectral models will provide principal input drivers for
              a high resolution model for grasslands and semiarid ecosystems worldwide.  In
              the process of working with the spectral data sets, the applicant will be
              developing image analysis "unmixing" techniques and examining the scaling
              properties of ecosystem processes.   This work will be conducted in the
              laboratory of Dr. Carol A. Wessman at the University of Colorado at Boulder,
              Center for the Study of Earth from Space.   N  ADVLTR  821                / @
