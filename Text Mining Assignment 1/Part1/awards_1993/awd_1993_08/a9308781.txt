Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Czech Joint                                   
              Fund research project between Dr. Emil Palecek,

              Sciences and Dr. Petr Zuman, Clarkson                                          
              University, is to examine structural changes                                   
              and interactions of DNA with biologically                                      
              important substances.  Specifically, the                                       
              researchers will: 1) prepare DNA-modified                                      
              mercury and graphite electrodes and 2) study                                   
              the interactions of DNA anchored at the                                        
              electrode surface with proteins, intercalating                                 
              drugs, metals, and cancerostatic substances as                                 
              compared with the DNA interactions in solution,                                
              using electrochemical and spectroscopic                                        
              methods.  The results of this project should                                   
              contribute to our understanding of the                                         
              interactions of nucleic acids with surfaces,                                   
              proteins, small ions and drugs.                                                
                                                                                             
              This research in molecular biophysics fulfills                                 
              the program objective of advancing scientific                                  
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                   
              U.S. and Czech Republic to combine                                             
              complementary talents and pool research                                        
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest                                   
              and competence.  Funds for the project are                                     
              awarded through the US-Czech Joint Fund,                                       
              Prague, in accordance with established
