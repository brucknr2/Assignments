Abstract    :
              9308563  Gambhir  The Principal Investigator's research focuses on the network 
              management technologies needed to enable mobile communicators to  use wireless
              LANs.  Two areas are addressed:  1) techniques and  protocols for mobile
              wireless workstation LAN connection and 2)  management databases supporting
              mobile wireless workstations.  In  the first area, the emphasis is on design of
              protocols to ease  network management as opposed to providing maximum
              bandwidth.   The work also considers support for "swarms", which are mobile 
              users previously unconnected with the wireless LAN who wish to  communicate
              with each other.  In the second area, the work on  management databases
              emphasizes methods by which user  workstations can dynamically add and delete
              MIB information on  themselves from management databases, and on the use of 
              framebased databases optimized for real-time update.  Validation  procedures
              for the user-added data include the use of maybe  algebras and inference
              procedures.  The award provides support  for three years.
