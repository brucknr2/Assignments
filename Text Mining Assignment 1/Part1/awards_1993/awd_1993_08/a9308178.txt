Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of labeled                         
              leupeptin derivatives containing 1-13C-argininal.  Enzyme                      
              activity as proteinase inhibitors will be probed by 13-C-NMR to                
              identify the structures in solution that can possibly act as                   
              transition-state analogs.

              With this Standard Grant RUI award, the Synthethic Organic                     
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. Rose M. McConnell of                 
              the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of                        
              Arkansas, Monticello.  Professor McConnell will focus her                      
              research of the preparation of 13C-labeled leupeptin                           
              derivatives that will be studied by NMR to determine the role                  
              of the compounds as proteinase inhibitors.  The research is                    
              especially ammenable to the involvement of undergraduates.
