Abstract    :
              Nowick         This research concerns the development of algorithms and 
              software tools for the design of asynchronous circuits.  Previous  work in the
              area has produced a "locally-clocked" asynchronous  design style, which
              produces high performance implementations  that are hazard-free at the gate
              level.  Three extensions to this  design style are being investigated.  The
              first is to explore an  alternative unclocked asynchronous controller design
              method,  which only requires a single feedback cycle to implement a state 
              change.  This work includes implementation of generalized burst  mode
              specifications to the unclocked state machines.  Second is  the development of
              extensions to hazard-free logic minimization.   The extensions include:  a
              heuristic two-level minimization  algorithm; an exact product-of-sums solution;
              time-optimized  multi-level logic synthesis; testing oriented two-level 
              minimization; and hazard-decreasing, multi-level transforms.   Third is an
              exploration of systematic ways to test asynchronous  designs.
