Abstract    :
              9308028  Davila  The goal of this Research Initiation award is to develop
              several  new techniques that can be used to analyze sensory evoked  potentials.
               One methods is a generalization of the traditional  ensemble averaging
              approach that should maximize the signal-to-  noise ratio.  The second proposed
              method would track the  principle eigenvectors of the evoked potential
              autocorrelation  matrix in order to find the frequency spectrum of the data.   
              This research is important since it has the potential to reduce  the amount of
              data, and consequently the time, needed to estimate  sensory evoked potential.
