Abstract    :
                   The proposed program of research entails studying absorption              
              processses by small cells mainly in oceanic biology. The behavior              
              of an individual molecule in the neighborhood of the surface of a              
              cell will be studied from the point of view of 3-dimensional                   
              Brownian motion.
