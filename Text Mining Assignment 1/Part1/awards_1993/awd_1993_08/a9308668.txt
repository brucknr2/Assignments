Abstract    :
              Akella         This research is focused on developing a systematic approach  for
              high-level synthesis of self-timed circuits.  The framework  for the research
              is a set of design tools (SHILPA) that produces  macro cell based realizations
              of circuits from behavioral  descriptions.  Research problems include the
              following:  1.     techniques for resource sharing based on flow analysis;  2. 
                 efficient partitioning of a sequential specification into a  set of
              communicating sequential processes;  3.     development of a tool for
              gate-level realizations of  asynchronous circuits in SHILPA; and  4.    
              investigating graphical and VHDL interfaces to SHILPA.
