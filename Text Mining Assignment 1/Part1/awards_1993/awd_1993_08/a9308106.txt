Abstract    :
                   This award supports research on Kauffman's knot invariants                
              and Hennings' 3-maniforld invariants, and the connection between               
              Hennings' invariants and the 3-manifold invariants described by                
              Reshetikhin and Turaev.  General classes of solutions to the                   
              quantum Yang-Baxter equation will also be sought by imposing                   
              certain conditions on a bialgebra closely associated to the                    
              Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan construction.  The principal                     
              investigator will also study the classes of finite-dimensional                 
              quasitriangular Hopf algebras and ribbon Hopf algebras                         
              emphasizing constructions from which new knot invariants are                   
              derived from given ones.  In addition, products related to the                 
              Hopf algebra dual of the quantized coordinate ring of affine                   
              groups will be investigated.                                                   
                   Quantum groups are a new area of research for both                        
              mathematicians and physicists.  On the mathematical side, it                   
              combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics,                      
              algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest to                 
              physicists working on conformal quantum field theory.
