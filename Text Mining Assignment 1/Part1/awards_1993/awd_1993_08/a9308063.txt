Abstract    :
              9308063  Palmore  This Fellow will study the interaction of proteins with
              surface  components.  A common problem with the design of biosensors, 
              artificial organs and synthetic biological fluids is the  inability to control
              surface/fluid interactions.  Current design  of biologically compatible
              materials is based on studies of  protein adsorption at structurally
              ill-defined surfaces.   Molecular mechanisms by which proteins are adsorbed are
              poorly   understood.  Specifically, this Fellow will study the adsorption  of
              cytochrome c at several well-defined surfaces.  Results of the  studies will
              lead to the development of a strategy toward the  rational design of
              biocompatible surfaces, and development of a   general technique for study of
              protein adsorption.  This work  will be performed in the laboratory of
              Professor George  Whitesides at Harvard University.  ***
