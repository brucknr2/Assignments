Abstract    :
              9308527  Hu  This project is to develop a method  of creating a defined path for
              cell  migration and tissue development in  three dimensional structures such as
               gels.  The results of this research  would be very important to tissue 
              engineering and developmental  biology.  One application of tissue  engineering
              would be the production  of artificial tissue, eg. artificial  liver or
              pancreas tissue.   Photoactivated reactions are to be  used to covalently
              couple  extracellular matrix or other cell  adhesion molecules to a three 
              dimensional substratum to define the  path for cell migration or  development. 
              The position of the  covalent coupling is defined by the  cross point of two
              laser beams.  The  size, geometry, and trajectory of  molecular deposition can
              be  generated by controlling the  scanning path of each laser beam.  ***
