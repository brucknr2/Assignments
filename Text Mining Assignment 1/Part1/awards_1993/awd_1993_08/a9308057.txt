Abstract    :
              Chavez  9308057  This applicant will study the regulation of polypeptide hormone
               release from storage sites within the cells where they are  synthesized. 
              Although much is known about the extracellular  factors involved in signalling
              for release of the hormones,  little has been done to elaborate the sequence of
              events inside  the cell.  Specifically, the applicant will focus on the role of
               two rab proteins that have been implicated in regulating release  of
              adrenocorticotrophic hormone from dense granules in the  secretory cell.  This
              work will be conducted in the laboratory of  Dr. Hsiao-Ping H. Moore at the
              University of California at  Berkeley.  ***
