Abstract    :
              Najm         This research is on synthesis algorithms for design of  reliable,
              low power CMOS and BiCMOS VLSI designs.  The basis for  the research is to use
              boolean transition density to measure  deviant activity and thus to help solve
              power consumption and  reliability issues.  Research activities include:  1.
              exploring use of circuit activity as a parameter to be  minimized; and  2.
              investigating the effects of minimizing local power  dissipation on circuit
              design.  Algorithms incorporating these new optimization ideas are being 
              developed and integrated into a synthesis environment.  The  environment
              integrates the objectives of optimizing area,  performance, testability,
              reliability, and power into a unified  set of design algorithms.
