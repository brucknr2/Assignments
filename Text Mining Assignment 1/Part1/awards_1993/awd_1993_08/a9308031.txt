Abstract    :
              Sosa  9308031  This applicant will work to elaborate the detailed sequence  of
              events in the development of connections (synapses)  between nerve cells in the
              cockroach.  Through intracellular  recording and microscopy, a detailed study
              of the beginning  function of synapses will be made and compared to events 
              occurring in the regeneration of the synapse following  damage.  Long term
              plans call for similar examinations of  mutants to clarify genetic and cellular
              environment factors  that are involved.  This work will be conducted in the 
              laboratory of Dr. Jonathan M. Blagburn at the Institute of  Neurobiology,
              University of Puerto Rico, and Dr. Jonathan P.  Bacon at the University of
              Sussex, UK.  ***
