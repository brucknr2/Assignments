Abstract    :
              9308895  Korel  This project will investigate dynamic program slicing and its 
              application in the debugging of large programs.  Slicing has been  shown to be
              useful in program debugging.  The major idea behind  slicing is to identify
              that part of the program that might  potentially contain the fault.  It has
              been shown that by taking  a particular program execution into account, dynamic
              slicing may  significantly reduce the size of the slice as compared to static 
              slicing.  As a result, dynamic slicing is better suited for the  purpose of
              debugging than static slicing.  Our objective in this  project is to continue
              our earlier research on dynamic slicing  and algorithmic debugging.  The
              investigation will involve  constructing a dynamic slicing environment,
              extending the theory  of dynamic slicing, development of new methods of dynamic
              slice  derivation, and evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic slicing  in the
              process of debugging of large programs.  ***
