Abstract    :
              9308953  Prabhu       The research will investigate a new approach to Linear  
              Programming (LP).  The approach exploits fundamental results from   Convex
              Polytope Theory and Polarity Theory that have not been   applied to LP
              computation previously.  Preliminary studies suggest   that the approach has
              prospects of yielding an efficient algorithm   that could be faster than the
              current LP algorithms.  The work   describes two methods for devising an
              efficient LP algorithm based   on the suggested approach:  Gale Transform
              Method and Simplicial   Refinement Method.  The methods apply classic results
              on the   combinatorial and  metric structure of polytopes to make   computation
              efficient.  Computational experiments on the methods   will be undertaken in
              parallel with theoretical investigations in   order to ensure that the
              resulting algorithm will be theoretically   efficient.         Enormous
              theoretical and computational research effort has   been expended in the past
              on attempts to convert the edge-following   Simplex method into a worst-case
              polynomial-time algorithm .  The   Generalized Simple scheme can be
              significant, in that it proffers   a fresh approach to the quest for worst-case
              polynomial-time   Simplex algorithms.  If these goals are achieved, the results
              will   have significant impact in solving real world problems.
