Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This  is  an  award under the Research Planning  Grant                   
              program  for women scientists and engineers.  The researcher                   
              will  study  the  relationship  between  labor  unrest   and                   
              industrial  restructuring  in the automobile,  textile,  and                   
              mining industries in the twentieth century.  She will extend                   
              her  previous  work  on this topic to  a  broader  range  of                   
              industries, construct a world-wide data base, and  formulate                   
              additional  hypotheses  as  preparation  for  a  subsequent,                   
              larger  project  that  will attempt to  test  a  variety  of                   
              hypotheses  about the forces behind industrial restructuring                   
              and relocation.                                                                
                    This  award  will initiate research which should  shed                   
              important   light  on  the  forces  that  are   transforming                   
              manufacturing and employment in the modern world.   As  such                   
              this project has potential policy importance in that it  may                   
              help us understand under what conditions companies do or  do                   
              not  decide to relocate or restructure.  In addition to  the                   
              scientific  gains  and social importance of  this  research,                   
              this  award  will  materially assist a young  researcher  to                   
              prepare  for a larger project, thereby contributing  to  the                   
              strengthening  of the national base of women scientists  and                   
              engineers.
