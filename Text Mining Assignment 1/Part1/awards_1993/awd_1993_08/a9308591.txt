Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This  is  an  award under the Research Planning  Grant                   
              program for women scientists and engineers.  It is a project                   
              to  study  gender  differences in small business  ownership.                   
              The  researcher will conduct qualitative fieldwork among  36                   
              small  firms  and construct a sampling frame and  pretest  a                   
              survey  instrument  for  a  planned  future  survey   of   a                   
              representative sample of 1200-1400 small business owners  in                   
              the Albany, NY, area.  The focus of the research will be  on                   
              gender  differences in selection into small business careers                   
              and in the ways in which family-work conflicts are handled.                    
                    This  award  will initiate research which should  shed                   
              important  light  on sexual differences  in  small  business                   
              entrepreneurship.   This is a topic of  considerable  policy                   
              importance, insofar as it may lead to new information  about                   
              the  obstacles  to  small business success  for  women.   In                   
              addition  to  the scientific gains and social importance  of                   
              this research, this award will materially assist a promising                   
              young  researcher  to prepare for a larger project,  thereby                   
              contributing  to the strengthening of the national  base  of                   
              women scientists and engineers.
