Abstract    :
              9308581  Crowe    Previous studies have shown that certain organisms that
              survive  complete dehydration (such as yeast cells, seeds) contain large 
              quantities of sugars, particularly trehalose or sucrose.  These  sugars
              preserve structure and function by replacing the water  around polar residues. 
              As a result, the membranes and proteins  are maintained in a physical state
              similar to that seen in the  fully hydrated preparations.    The same sugars
              also stabilize liposomes in the dry state.  As a  result of these findings,
              liposomes, which are in use for  clinical treatment of certain diseases, can be
              shipped as dry  powders.  Upon rehydration, they are ready for use.    Based on
              these previous findings, it has been suggested that  presence of one of these
              sugars is sufficient to preserve  structure and function in any cell upon
              drying. However, further  evidence has emerged that while cells that are not
              normally  adapted to drying can be induced to survive when the sugars are 
              introduced, they usually die soon thereafter.  This project is  aimed at
              discovering the mechanisms that destabilize such cells  and the means by which
              cells that are normally adapted to drying  escape that destabilization.  We
              expect the results not only to  be of scientific interest, but also to be
              useful in the  preservation of biological structure and function by drying or 
              freezing.  ***
