Abstract    :
              CTS-9308841  Drexel University  Xiaowei S. He    ABSTRACT       Mechanical
              properties of structural materials often depends on  the processes occuring
              during solidification.  Modeling  solidification is difficult because phenomena
              in the mushy zone  occur over many different length and time scales.  The 
              relationships between dendritic microstructure and macroscopic  transport will
              be investigated with cellular automaton simulation  of flow, temperature and
              concentration fields at the microscopic  level.  Results for the microstructure
              model can be coupled to  macroscopic phenomena by statistical analysis.    
              Better understanding of the underlying processes involved during 
              solidification should lead to less waste and increased efficiency  during
              production of many solid materials, making American industry  more competitive.
