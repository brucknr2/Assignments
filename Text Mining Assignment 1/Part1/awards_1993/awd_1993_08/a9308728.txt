Abstract    :
              9308728 Finn          Should construction progress according to schedule, the
              Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO) detector will make
              its first observations in the late 1990s.  Consequently, there is an urgent
              need for accurate and complete appraisals of sources of gravitational radiation
              to          1.  Guide the design of the advanced LIGO   X       
              instrumentation,  !             2.  Provide the foundation for the analysis and
                X        interpretation of the forth coming observations and  !            
              3.  Suggest directions for the initial investigations of    X       
              gravitational wave astronomy.  !             In order to be useful, these
              appraisals must take into account the precise nature of the LIGO detector and
              our best understanding of the anticipated radiation sources.          With this
              motivation and goal, Prof. Finn will initiate a program of research to provide
              detailed assessments of astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation
              appropriate for modern interferometric gravitational wave detectors.  The
              sources considered will include inspiralling binary neutron star/black hole
              systems, freely precessing pulsars, and non axisymmetric (rotating, but not
              precessing) pulsars. ***
