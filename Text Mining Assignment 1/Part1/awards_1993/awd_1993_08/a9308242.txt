Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a workshop on performance                   
              analysis and user requirements for scalable parallel systems.                  
              The workshop, the fourth in the series, will be held in Keystone,              
              Colorado, during April 5-7, 1993.  During the previous 1988,1989,              
              and 1991 workshops, we recognized a pressing need for a                        
              continuing exchange of ideas on performance measurement and                    
              analysis among various groups engaged in high-performance,                     
              parallel computing.  These groups include the practicing                       
              scientists who use parallel systems and performance analysis                   
              tools, the vendors who design parallel systems, and the academic               
              researchers in high-performance computing who are exploring                    
              software tools and performance analysis techniques for parallel                
              systems.  The proposed workshop is designed to bring together                  
              representatives of academia, industry, national laboratories, and              
              government agencies to explore these issues.  The discussions                  
              will focus primarily on issues of performance measurement,                     
              analysis,and visualization as they relate to these needs.
