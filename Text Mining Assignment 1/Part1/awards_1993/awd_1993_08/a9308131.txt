Abstract    :
              9308131  Powers  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which
              is to develop a  fundamental understanding of nonaqueous phase  liquid
              entrapment and dissolution processes  in heterogeneous subsurface systems and
              to  develop a phenomenological model to  mathematically described these
              processes.   The investigator plans on using an approach  that involves both
              experimental and  mathematical modeling of the problem.  The  experimental
              activity includes simulation of  the nonaqueous fluids using polymerized 
              styrene which will allow visualization and  characterization of the fluid
              distribution  within the medium studied.    The proposal leading to this award
              was  submitted in response to NSF 92-122, Research  Initiation Awards Program
              Announcement and  Guidelines.  Results are expected to provide  a more
              fundamental understanding of phenomena  associated with movement of nonaqueous
              fluids  through porous media than now exists leading  to an improvement in
              models used in  engineering design of remediation processes  and systems for
              decontamination of soils  contaminated with these types of fluids.
