Abstract    :
              A coarse-grained data flow (CGD) virtual machine model of                      
              computing for the development of a programming environment                     
              for parallel programs on MIMD architectures will be                            
              investigated. This paradigm will be evaluated using three                      
              criteria:  (a) portability across a wide range of parallel                     
              architectures, and (b) effective support for performance                       
              monitoring and debugging, and (c) ease of use.  To study the                   
              portability of this paradigm, Charm, a run time system for                     
              portable parallel programming on MIMD architectures has been                   
              developed.  To date, numerous reallife applications have                       
              been implemented using Charm, thus making it an effective                      
              testbed.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              To study the effectiveness of CGD as a portable programming                    
              paradigm, Intrepid - an integrated environment for                             
              performance monitoring, instrumentation and debugging, will                    
              be developed on a network of Unix workstations.  Programs                      
              developed using Intrepid will be capable of running                            
              efficiently on a wide range of MIMD architectures without                      
              change.  In a single environment, Intrepid will enable the                     
              comparison of the performance of parallel programs on                          
              different MIMD computers.  This will permit the                                
              identification of architectural and operating system level                     
              support that is required for the efficient, portable                           
              implementation of the CGD paradigm.
