Abstract    :
              9308837  Betenbaugh  This  project  is  on  research to  increase  the 
              expression  of  correctly  folded  (active)  antibodies  in  insect  cells.  
              The  expression  of  functional  antibodies  is  accompanied  by   the 
              formation of abnormal protein complexes and aggregates  in  which  the  
              polypeptide  chains  are  bound  together  into   incorrect  associations.   
              This  research  will  attempt  to   reduce   the  aggregation reactions, in
              order to increase the yield  of  active  antibodies,  by  increasing  the 
              intracellular  levels  of   two  catalytic  proteins,  immunoglobin  binding 
              protein  (BiP),  and  protein disulfide isomerase (PDI).  This will be
              accomplished  by  cloning  genes  for BiP and PDI into baculovirus.  Also, 
              kinetic  models will be developed to determine rate-limiting steps and  to 
              optimize the assembly of active antibodies.  ***
