Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to increase the safety and                        
              reliability of real-world software systems.  The research is                   
              directed toward the development of practical techniques and                    
              the construction of automated tools for verifying properties                   
              of concurrent and real-time software.  Many techniques have                    
              been proposed for this task, but little is known about their                   
              performance and range of applicability in practice.  This                      
              research will conduct a thorough empirical evaluation of two                   
              promising techniques and a new technique that is a hybrid of                   
              the two.  The techniques will be evaluated by constructing                     
              tools that automate them and applying these tools to a large                   
              number of sample systems.  The information obtained will                       
              provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the                      
              techniques examined and will help developers choose an                         
              appropriate technique for their particular domain.
