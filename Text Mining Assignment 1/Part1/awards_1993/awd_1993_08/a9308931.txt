Abstract    :
              9308931 Peters          The electronics industry is characterized by wide
              product variety, rapid product changes, and short product life cycle.  Flexible
              assembly systems have been cited as a production system able to cope with the
              challenges of this type of environment.  However, little research has been done
              to investigate what constitutes a flexible assembly system or how to design
              them.  This research will investigate the design and planning of flexible
              assembly systems from a strategic perspective.  The objective of the research
              are threefold:  (1) to characterize flexibility and to determine the causes of
              flexibility, (2) to develop analysis tools for determining an initial system
              design under time varying production requirements, where the system design
              consists of the number of facilities, the configuration of each facility, the
              capacity of each facility, and the assignment of products to facilities; and
              (3) to develop analysis tools and solution methodologies for determining and
              evaluating strategies for system changeovers over time, including product
              reassignments and capacity and configuration changes.          Currently,
              practitioners are ill equipped to address flexibility issues and to make
              strategic planning decisions in rapidly changing environments.  This research
              will provide tools to aid decision makers in designing and planning flexible
              assembly systems.
