Abstract    :
              9398640  Arora  This project addresses the design, implementation and
              application  of  distributed systems whose input-output relation  is  violated 
              only  temporarily  when  faults occur. Such  "nonmasking"  fault-  tolerance 
              is often desirable in distributed systems for  reasons  of  efficiency,
              computability, or application. One  goal  of  the  research  is  to 
              demonstrate that a  certain  nonmasking  fault-  tolerant  system,  namely a
              stabilizing reset subsystem,  can  be  implemented  efficiently  and  utilized 
              effectively  in  a  wide  variety of distributed environments. To this end,    
                  (i) software  will  be  developed that  augments  any  given          
              distributed system with a stabilizing reset subsystem,              (ii)  tools
               will be implemented that measure the efficiency           of nonmasking
              fault-tolerance, and              (iii)  applications will be demonstrated
              where the  software           is useful.    Another  goal  of the research is
              to demonstrate that  nonmasking  fault-tolerant distributed systems can be
              designed in  a  uniform  and rigorous manner. To this end, methods will be
              developed for         (i)   system   design   based   on  distributed  
              constraint          satisfaction,              (ii)  systems  design  based  on
              stepwise  refinements  that          preserve nonmasking fault-tolerance, and  
                         (iii)  reasoning  about  nonmasking fault-tolerance  in  the        
               presence of real-time actions and constraints.    The  research will build
              upon the investigator's prior work on  a  uniform  and  rigorous  framework 
              for  reasoning  about   fault-  tolerance.  ***
