Abstract    :
              9308924  Smith  There exists a vast potential for  applying unconventional
              computing  methods to many electromagnetics  (EM) problems to reduce the amount
                of intuitive analysis and to relax  the computational intensity of many 
              problems.  Choice of a particular  method depends on the application  and the
              data being analyzed.   Initially this study focuses on  improving the radiation
              properties  of large distorted satellite  reflector antennas.  Preliminary 
              investigations indicate the neural  network computing algorithms could  be used
              for electromagnetic  compensation for surface errors.   The advantages of using
              this  intelligent approach versus one of  the exiting methods are speed 
              (allowing real-time radiation  control) and data reduction.  The  first part of
              this study involves  bringing this new technology to a  mature state.  The
              ultimate goal of  this effort is application of these  intelligent
              electromagnetic  compensation methods to active  control of electromagnetic 
              compatibility (EMC) problems  associated with electronic devices.    Passive
              control methods using  shielding, ground wires, etc.  have  long been used.  
              With higher clock  frequencies and the use of  nonmetallic materials in auto 
              bodies and aircraft fuselages,  unwanted radiation is an ever  increasing
              problem.  This  investigation proposes to  investigate active control of 
              radiated emissions.  ***
