Abstract    :
              The 8th Maryland Theoretical Computer Science Day will take place March        
              19, 1993, in the new Engineering/Computer Science Building at the              
              University of Maryland Baltimore County.  Five distinguished speakers          
              will deliver fifty-minute talks on their current research.  The program        
              will cover a broad range of current topics on theoretical computer             
              science and its applications, including biological computing,                  
              combinatorial analysis of algorithms, complexity theory, learning              
              theory, and cryptology.  This one-day event is expected to attract             
              approximately one hundred researchers and advanced graduate students           
              from the greater Baltimore-Washington D.C. area, including members of          
              local Universities, businesses, and government agencies.  Maryland             
              Theory Day, which is held in cooperation with the University of Maryland       
              Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, stimulates and facilitates the        
              advancement of computer science through promoting interaction and joint        
              work among local researchers.  In addition, holding this event for the         
              first time at UMBC will help establish UMBC's young and growing Computer       
              Science Department.
