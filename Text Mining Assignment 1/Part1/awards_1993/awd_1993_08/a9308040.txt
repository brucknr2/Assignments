Abstract    :
              Gama-Torres  9308040  This applicant will study a novel gene regulating
              embryonal  carcinoma cell differentiation and tumorigenesis in a mutant cell 
              line differing in these properties from the parent cell line.   Specifically,
              sequencing of the region of DNA flanking a single   insertion mutation has
              revealed an open reading frame with no  homology to any known mouse gene. 
              Further analysis of the gene  encoded at the disrupted locus will be pursued. 
              This work will  be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Paulette J. McCormick  
              at the University at Albany, State University of New York.  ***
