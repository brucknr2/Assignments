Abstract    :
              This small grant for exploratory research project is using tail                
              fiber parts from the bacterial virus T4 to examine the mechanical              
              and other properties of these proteinaceous building materials,                
              many of which seem to exhibit unusual strength and stiffness.                  
              Dimer fragments are being produced in quantities appropriate for               
              structural analysis.  The structural information from these                    
              materials will be used to facilitate molecular modelling and                   
              theoretical estimations of properties such as stiffness, elasticity            
              and tensile strength, as well as in designing novel structural                 
              parts.  Longer polymers will be made by using genetic techniques to            
              alter the ends of the basic building blocks.  Average length of the            
              polymers can be determined by adding "stop" subunits in different              
              limiting concentrations.

              This research has the potential to produce novel materials from                
              biological products.
