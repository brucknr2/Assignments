Abstract    :
              9308246  Bock  This research investigates the environmental dispute in rural and
               urban Oregon regarding the survival of the Northern Spotted Owl.   The owl has
              come to represent a focal point in debates between  environmentalists and
              loggers over the management of old growth  forests that remain on federal
              lands.  This award enhances on-  going dissertation research investigating the
              psychological and  moral components of this debate.  The project uses field
              methods  from cultural anthropology and the analytic tools pertinent to  social
              psychology studies of emotion.  The results are expected  to help bridge the
              gap between psychological and cultural  approaches in the field of risk
              perceptions.  ***
