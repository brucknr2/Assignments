Abstract    :
              The proposed research is for                                                   
              developing new algorithms for                                                  
              distributed implementation of                                                  
              "optimal power flow" (OPF) in a                                                
              large power system.  In view of the                                            
              size of the system a decomposition                                             
              of the system is proposed.  "Shadow

              the distributed calculations in

              interpretations can be placed in                                               
              the regional interchanges.  The                                                
              regions would be relatively large

              The interregional communications
