Abstract    :
              9308238  Admati    Much controversy surrounds the division between ownership and
               management of large corporations.  Diversified ownership confers  benefits
              from spreading risk, but it can dull owners' incentives to  monitor managers. 
              Shareholders who control a significant fraction  of the shares of a firm have
              stronger incentives to monitor and  control its managers; indeed, it has been
              claimed that the greater  concentration of ownership found in Japan and Germany
              has resulted  in more effective control of managers, lower costs of capital,
              and  (thus) greater levels of investment and efficiency than in the U.S.   The
              authors will investigate how ownership patterns and the  resulting patterns of
              monitoring management are determined as an  equilibrium, and how they affect
              the cost of capital, investment,  and corporate performance.  Research will
              study both mature,  publicly held firms whose shares are traded in well
              functioning  markets, and privately held firms, where the "large shareholders" 
              are venture capitalists.  The methods employed will be primarily  theoretical
              in nature, based on economic models of capital markets  and self-interested
              behavior.  This research should lead to better  understanding of the efficiency
              of capital markets and how they  interact with the productive sector, leading
              to better-informed  regulatory prescriptions.    ***
