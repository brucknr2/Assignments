Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The researchers propose an examination of the mechanisms                  
              that control the terrestrial supply of dissolved organic carbon                
              to streams, emphasizing measurements of concentration and                      
              susceptibility to biological utilization. The proposed research                
              focuses on headwater streams in the Eastern Deciduous Biome.                   
              Research objectives include measuring:  (1) the sources of                     
              terrestrially derived dissolved organic carbon entering streams,               
              such as groundwater, soilwater, and wetlands, (2) the biological               
              utility and molecular composition of these terrestrial sources,                
              and (3) the influence of biological activity near the streambanks              
              and below the streambed on the concentrations of dissolved                     
              organic carbon in the steamwater.                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              Organic carbon dynamics are central to stream ecosystem studies                
              because they link energy flow and nutrient cycling.  Dissolved                 
              organic carbon may contribute from 30% to 75% of the total energy              
              input into stream ecosystems.  Despite numerous advances during                
              the past two decades, there is still only a poor understanding of              
              how much dissolved organic carbon actually enters streams and                  
              rivers, and concomitantly, how much is utilized within the                     
              ecosystems.
