Abstract    :
              9308979 York This project will explore a new technology for low noise power
              amplification in the microwave and millimeter wave regime using a combination
              of parametric effects and quasi optical techniques.  Although parametric
              amplifiers have long been known to posses superior noise properties to
              conventional transistor amplifiers, they have not been fully utilized in modern
              microwave systems due to limited power handling capacity, requirement of a
              strong high frequency pump signal, and sensitive circuit design. Some of these
              problems can be circumvented by operating a large planar array of low power
              parametric devices synchronously, with input and output signals coupled through
              simple antennas to propagating beams in free space. There is also evidence from
              analogous parametric laser systems that noise figure can be reduced further by
              exploiting the inherent phase sensitive amplification of parametric systems
              (squeezed states).  Two types of arrays negative resistance parametric
              amplifiers, and frequency upconverters will be explored during this project. 
              In the former case, spontaneous parametric oscillation is also possible and
              could provide a useful technique for sub harmonic and harmonic generation.
