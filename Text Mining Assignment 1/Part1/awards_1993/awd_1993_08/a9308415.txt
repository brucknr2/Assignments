Abstract    :
              9308415  Seales  This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing
              Research  Initiation Award.  The long-term goal of this research is to  develop
              and implement new strategies for building complete models  of three-dimensional
              objects from video sequences.  Efficient 3D  model-building capabilities are
              fundamental for mobile robot vision  tasks such as learning new shapes,
              manipulating intricate objects,  navigating around obstacles, and recognizing a
              known shape.  A  central focus of this project is the analysis of the problem
              of  recovering global three-dimensional shape information from an image 
              sequence under minimal viewing conditions using image curves that  are formed
              from both smooth and non-smooth components of three-  dimensional shapes. The
              viewing situations include two main  scenarios: active feedback strategies
              where information in the  image sequence is used to control the camera system;
              and  uncalibrated camera rigs where camera parameters are unknown. This  work
              is based upon an analysis of the behavior of projected curves  in image
              sequences and their relationship to three-dimensional  shape.  This research
              will provide a deeper theoretical and  empirical understanding that will lead
              to the development of  efficient, implemented and tested strategies for
              building detailed  models of three-dimensional objects under minimal viewing 
              conditions.
