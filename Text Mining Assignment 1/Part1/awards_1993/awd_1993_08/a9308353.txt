Abstract    :
               The ability to realistically simulate physical objects' motion  behaviors has
              become an area of great importance in science,  engineering, training and
              planning.  Realistic simulation  requires accurately modeling the behavior and
              interactions of  contacting objects.  In particular, it is necessary to be able
               to simulate the same non-interpenetrating motion that real-  world objects
              undergo.  An important subset of physical  simulation is simulations where all
              objects are modeled as  being perfectly rigid.  The abstraction of a perfectly
              rigid  body, though physically unobtainable, is an excellent and  reasonable
              approximation for many real-world applications in  robotics and computer
              graphics.  Even with the rigid-body  assumption, simulation is made difficult
              by the need to deal  with complex surface geometries and contact phenomena such
              as  friction.  This project aims at extending the capabilities of current 
              physical simulation systems that model contact and collision  between systems
              of rigid bodies and explore practical uses for  simulation systems. 
              Specifically, the investigation centers  on the development of new geometrical
              algorithms that allow  for simulations with greater levels of geometric
              complexity,  and the extension of computational complexity bounds and 
              algorithms for the problem of contact with friction.  This  project will also
              explore using non-interpenetration  constraints to aid in interactive
              computer-aided design and  modeling applications.
