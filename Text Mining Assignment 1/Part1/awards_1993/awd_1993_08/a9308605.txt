Abstract    :
                   Generalized Lagrangian duality related to nonconvex multiple              
              objective programming will provide new techniques for generating               
              efficient solutions.  Efficiency concept will be extended by                   
              incorporating the information about the location of solutions                  
              with respect to a duality about the location of solutions with                 
              respect to a duality gap.  A complete characterization of the                  
              efficient set of the bicriteria problem will be included.
