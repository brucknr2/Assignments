Abstract    :
              Hwu         Speculative execution and predicated execution are two  important
              sources of parallelism for VLIW and superscalar  processors.  Speculative
              execution tentatively executes  instructions before knowing that their
              execution is required.   Predicated execution merges multiple possible
              execution paths  into a single path so that the hardware can simultaneously 
              process multiple paths.  Both methods allow the compiler to  extract program
              parallelism in the presence of conditional  branches.  With superscalar and
              VLIW designs becoming  increasingly popular in the microprocessor industry,
              these  methods have become increasingly important for future high  performance
              microprocessors to achieve their performance goals.         This project
              addresses three critical issues involved in  incorporating speculative
              execution and predicated execution into  future superscalar and VLIW
              microprocessor systems.  First, the  design complexity of increasing levels of
              architecture support  for speculative execution and predicated execution are
              being  studied.  Secondly, compiler optimizers and schedulers that  exploit
              each level of the architecture support are being  developed.  Thirdly, an
              integrated approach is being defined to  coordinate speculative execution and
              predicated execution to best  improve program execution performance.  The
              objective is to  provide architecture expertise and compiler prototypes
              required  for the microprocessor industry to understand the cost and 
              effectiveness of each level of hardware support.
