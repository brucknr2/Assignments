Abstract    :
                   This award supports the implementation and testing of a                   
              prototype computer system that will allow CISE departments                     
              connected to Internet, electronic access to technical and research             
              reports.  This is a collaborative effort between Old Dominion                  
              University, Virginia Polytechnic University, SUNY at Albany, and               
              the University of Virginia.                                                    
                                                                                             
                   A workshop was held at Snowbird'92 to formulate the initial               
              recommendation.  The proposed system will consist of a central                 
              index to be kept on dual servers which will store relevant                     
              information in an easily accessible format.  Each participating                
              site will locally store its own reports and will handle index                  
              interactions between the central site and the central index                    
              facility.  The prototype system will be implemented at the four                
              collaborating institutions.  Testing of the proposed prototype will            
              also include user testing and evaluation of the performance and                
              scalability of the system.
