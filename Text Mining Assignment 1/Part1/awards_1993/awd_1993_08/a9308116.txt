Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Financial support is requested for young faculty and graduate                  
              students to participate in a NATO workshop on the subject of                   
              spatio-temporal patterns in nonequilibrium complex systems.  The               
              aims of the workshop are:  1) to bring together researchers working            
              with a variety of different materials and to work towards a unified            
              description of pattern formation in complex systems, and 2) examine            
              and foster the role of pattern formation in science and technology.            
              This workshop, which is third in a series, will be held in Santa               
              Fe, New Mexico during April 1, 1993 through June 30, 1993.
