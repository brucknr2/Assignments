Abstract    :
              9308341  Jiang  The purpose of this Research Initiation Award is to develop a 
              continuum model which is capable of describing the macroscopic  behavior of
              ferroelectric crystals undergoing phase transformations  under the combined
              influence of thermomechanical loads and electric  fields.  A unified approach
              which is valid for transformations  induced by mechanical, thermal and/or
              electrical components is the  ultimate goal of this research.
