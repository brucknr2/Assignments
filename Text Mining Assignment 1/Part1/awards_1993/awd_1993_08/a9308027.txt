Abstract    :
                   This research will serve to investigate the results of the                
              initiative, "Intelligent Material Handling."  It will investigate              
              the research topics funded and the success in linking the research             
              activities with industry.  It will also provide interaction with               
              industry and an evaluation of the research activities in industry              
              as well as their needs for collaborative research with academe.                
                   The results of this work will be an assessment of the progress            
              of the research and its relevance to industry.  It will also                   
              facilitate interaction with industry and promote technology                    
              transfer for the NSF funded research.
