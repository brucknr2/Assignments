Abstract    :
              9308443  Mizruchi    This project will develop and test a model of corporate
              financing  drawn from organizational theory and institutional economics, which 
              focuses on four factors: the availability of capital, the cost of  capital, the
              strategic orientation of the firm, and the  embeddedness of the firm's decision
              making apparatus.  To test the  model, a longitudinal data set will be
              collected, using as a  baseline the 200 largest U.S. manufacturing corporations
              in 1955  and following these firms through 1992.  The study will seek to 
              predict several variables, including a firm's total use of external  financing,
              total debt and equity financing, and specific types of  debt, including
              short-term, long-term private, and long-term  public.  The independent
              variables will include a firm's available  capital (retained earnings), its
              board composition, the background  of its CEO, alternative forms of financing,
              participation in  acquisitions, and market context variables such as interest
              rates,  phase of the business cycle, and the aggregate demand for capital  in
              the economy.  The research will also examine the determinants of  strategies
              such as mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, and  long-term investments such
              as research and development and new  plant and equipment expenditures.  The
              study will provide an  empirical evaluation of the institutional and network
              embeddedness  of organizational behavior.  %%%  This project in economic
              sociology will contribute sociological  insights to a scientific understanding
              of corporate financing and  of the various strategies that corporations adopt. 
              The results may  identify inefficiencies and sources of poor decision making,
              thus  increasing the knowledge base that can strengthen American 
              competitiveness and promote economic growth.    ***
