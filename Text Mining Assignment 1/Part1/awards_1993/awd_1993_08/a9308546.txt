Abstract    :
              9308546   Hopp        In prior research and teaching in the Master's of
              Management  in Manufacturing Program at Northwestern, these researchers have 
              evolved a system of relationships or "laws" governing factory   behavior.  They
              term this system, Factory Physics, and have found  it to be a useful framework
              for comparing competing production   control policies.  In particular, it is a
              valuable tool for   communicating the subtle tradeoffs involved in the design
              and   control of a manufacturing system to students, both in academic  
              programs and in industrial short courses.        Some of the key Factory
              Physics concepts are based on results  from queueing theory.  Unfortunately,
              the vast majority of students  for whom Factory Physics id designed have little
              familiarity with  this topic.  For this reason, they make extensive use of
              animated  computer simulations to illustrate queueing concepts.  While such 
              simulations have been very effective in classroom presentations,  they make use
              of commercial packages that are expensive and time-  consuming to learn.  As a
              result, have not been able to provide   students with a hands-on learning
              experience.  In this project, the  researcher will develop a self-contained,
              interactive software   package that will allow students to easily examine the
              key types  of queueing behavior in a manufacturing system.  Since it will not 
              require a commercial package, recipients will be free to duplicate  it, use it
              in their own teaching, and carry it to industry as a   tool for convincing
              managers in their companies of the efficacy of  policies that are often
              overlooked in industry, such as variance  reduction.
