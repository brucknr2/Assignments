Abstract    :
              9308530  Sleight    New complex oxides which contain at least four elements will
              be  prepared, and their properties and atomic structures will be  determined
              and related to bonding and electronic structure.   Generally, elements from
              different sections of the periodic table  are selected.  A systematic study
              will be made of complex osides  which contain a transition metal cation
              together with a post-  transition metal cation and a pre-transition metal
              cation.  At  least in the initial stages, specific properties will not be 
              sought.  Rather, the emphasis will be on developing systematic  approaches to
              the synthesis of new complex oxides.  The proposed  work seeks to identify
              unknown structures and properties that  cannot exist for simple oxides.  The
              focus will be on single phase  materials rather than composites.  The overall
              goal of this  exploratory synthesis program is to escape the intellectual 
              confines of current knowledge base and to discover new materials  that are
              useful, inexpensive, nontoxic and easy to manufacture.   Oxides have already
              been widely studied, however, much remains to  be accomplished with oxides,
              particularly because oxides generally  have advantages over other materials
              both in ease of synthesis and  in terms of high stability in the presence of
              air.  ***
