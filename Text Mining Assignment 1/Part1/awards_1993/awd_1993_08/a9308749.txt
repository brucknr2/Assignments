Abstract    :
              9308749  Austen  Computerized tomography (CT) is a well-known technique in
              medical  imaging.  These techniques have been applied to ionospheric imaging 
              and have shown promising results.  This project will develop this  technique to
              the point where it is feasible to deploy a system to  amke measurements.  There
              are several problems which need to be  addressed.  One is the data is known to
              only within a constant  value; the determination of that constant will be
              integrated into  the technique.  The second problem is that the vertical
              information  is lost due to the measurement technique.  This project will 
              address this problem by developing methods for incorporating  additional data
              into the technique.  Other items which will be  studied are the placement of
              receivers, methods for increasing the  resolution of the technique, and the
              possibility of extending the  technique to three-dimensional imaging.  ***
