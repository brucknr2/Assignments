Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation grant will allow the investigator to                  
              study tumor cell micromotion during chemotactic stimulation                    
              through both experimental observations and mathematical modeling.              
              The specific aims are to:  1) develop a system to manipulate                   
              tumor cells during pseudopod migration, 2) determine the factors               
              affecting pseudopod protrusion; 3) develop mathematical models                 
              for pseudopod formation and cell movement; and 4) correlate                    
              pseudopod characteristics with cytoskeletal structure.                         
                                                                                             
              This research is important since it will contribute towards and                
              understanding of the mechanics of metastases of tumor cells and                
              provide basic information needed to understand physiological                   
              processes such as tissue development.
