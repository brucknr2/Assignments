Abstract    :
                    9308937  Brinson  The research addresses a critical concern for the
              advancement and  use of shape memory alloys (SMAs) in smart structure
              technology.   In this investigation a generalized and unified constitutive law
              is  developed that describes the thermomechanical behavior of shape  memory
              materials in terms of their martensitic phase  transformations.  The derived
              relations will be incorporated into  a nonlinear finite element procedure and
              used to replicate  experiments.  This research will utilize mathematical and
              numerical  methods and limited experimental testing, combined with detailed 
              understanding of the micromechanical material behavior, to develop 
              constitutive relations that extend, correct and advance work  previously done
              in this area.  ***
