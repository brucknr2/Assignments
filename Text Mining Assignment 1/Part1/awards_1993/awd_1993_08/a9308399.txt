Abstract    :
               The goal of this research is to carry out the   analysis of structured
              (e.g.Toeplitz) matrix pairs and to  analyze the convergence behavior of the
              numerical algorithm   connection with constructing efficient preconditioners. 
              Numerical algorithms are developed for updating and  downdating problems
              associated with canonical correlations  when data points are added or deleted. 
              Theories and  algorithms are developed for the following extensions of 
              canonical correlations: canonical correlations with a general  bilinear form,
              canonical correlations with linear equality  constraints, canonical
              correlations of several data sets.  This research is expected to yield new
              concepts in matrix  decompositions and numerical linear algebra and statistical
               computation, and facilitate and further spread the use of  canonical
              correlation analysis in the general scientific  community.
