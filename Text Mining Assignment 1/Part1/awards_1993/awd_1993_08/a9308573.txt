Abstract    :
                   While researchers in artificial intelligence planning have                
              been concerned with failure recovery and debugging for some time,              
              there has been no concerted effort to evaluate failure recovery and            
              planning or support the design and debugging of plan knowledge                 
              bases for new environments.  The proposed research fills this gap              
              with new tools for analyzing planning systems and a methodology for            
              determining why these systems fail and what can be done about it.              
              The PI's thesis described a procedure, Failure Recovery Analysis               
              (FRA), for analyzing the performance of a planner (the Phoenix                 
              planner) in its environment to determine whether and how it might              
              be causing its own failure.  The PI proposes to extend her thesis              
              research by applying it to another planner and environment, and                
              automating and integrating FRA in a tool to assist designers in                
              evaluating and debugging planner knowledge bases.//
