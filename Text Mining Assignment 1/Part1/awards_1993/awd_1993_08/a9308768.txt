Abstract    :
              9308768  Baldwin       Baldwin intends to investigate stable structures derived
              as  the homogeneous universal model for classes of finite structures  with
              dimension functions.  These structures have significantly  broadened the class
              of stable structures in recent years.  In  particular, he asks whether
              structures of this sort can possibly  satisfy the Vaught or Lachlan
              conjectures, i.e. whether the  theory of such a structure can have finitely
              many or aleph-one  countable models.  He will also study the relation between 
              `generic' models for classes of finite structures and recent  advances in the
              study of `random' models by Spencer.  During the  last twenty years stability
              theory has developed a technical  apparatus for detailed investigation of a
              large class of  mathematical structures.  Zil'ber suggested that in fact all 
              the structures involved were tied very closely to classical  structures. 
              Hrushovski provided a counterexample to this  conjecture.  Baldwin refined his
              construction to find a new  non-Desarguesian projective plane.  Baldwin also
              discovered a  close connection between these structures and the theory of 
              random graphs.  Baldwin intends to study this new class of  structures: to see
              whether they provide counterexamples to some  other long standing conjectures
              and to explore further the  connection with random graphs.  ***
