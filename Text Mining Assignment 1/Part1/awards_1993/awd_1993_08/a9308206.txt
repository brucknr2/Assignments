Abstract    :
              This project is in the area of unit                                            
              commitment and hydrothermal                                                    
              scheduling.  These problems are                                                
              complicated because of their large                                             
              size, mixed (integer and real)                                                 
              variables, nonlinearity, and                                                   
              uncertainty.  A new algorithm will                                             
              be developed.  The thermal and                                                 
              hydro subproblems are handled                                                  
              differently. For the thermal                                                   
              subproblem, the unit commitment                                                
              part will be solved using Lagrange                                             
              relation to avoid the                                                          
              dimensionality problem, while the                                              
              calculation of thermal generation                                              
              is solved analytically.  The hydro                                             
              subproblem will be further                                                     
              decomposed into a number of                                                    
              independent subproblems, and will                                              
              be solved in parallel by using                                                 
              constraint relaxed differential                                                
              dynamic programming.  There are                                                
              many advantages claimed for this                                               
              approach.  If successful, the                                                  
              method will not only yield                                                     
              substantial economic benefits, but                                             
              will also advance the state of the
