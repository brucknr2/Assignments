Abstract    :
              9308163  Schunk  The proposed research is a continuation of theoretical studies
              of  the effects that plasma transport processes have on the ionosphere.   The
              proposed research spans a 3-year period and will be conducted  by five senior
              scientists, two postdoctoral fellows, and a graduate  student.  The research
              involves model/data and model/model  comparisons, theoretical studies of
              ionospheric dynamics and  electrodynamics, ionospheric outflow studies (polar
              wind), and  certain plasmaspheric studies.  The overall scientific approach is 
              to consider the ionosphere as an integrated system, which interacts  with both
              the magnetosphere and thermosphere.  The various members  of the group will
              study different, but related, ionospheric  problems, with the result that
              almost all of the major ionospheric  regions will be studied, including the
              E-region, F-region, and  topside ionosphere at equatorial, middle, and high
              latitudes.  In  the course of the studies, certain models will be upgraded
              and/or  improved, but the bulk of the proposed studies will be conducted  with
              existing ionospheric, plasmaspheric, polar wind, and  electrodynamic models. 
              The proposed research is directly related  to one of the main goals of both the
              international/STEP and  NSF/CEDAR programs, which is to elucidate the processes
              linking the  ionosphere-magnetosphere-thermosphere system.  ***
