Abstract    :
              9308168  Suits  This work addresses fundamental issues of atomic and electronic 
              structure and the deformation mechanism in cluster-assembled  nanophase metals.
               Nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) techniques will  be applied to metallic
              samples prepared by consolidation of small  clusters.  These nanophase samples
              will have a grain size of a few  nanometers and can be up to five times
              stronger than the same      material with a larger grain size.  The atomic
              scale effect on the  nmr response and the site-selective nature of the nmr
              measurements  will provide a new and unique view of the structure of these 
              materials.  The NMR work is performed in conjunction with sample  preparation
              performed at Argonne National Laboratory.  %%%  Nuclear Magnetic resonance
              (NMR) provides information on the  structural and electronic properties of
              materials as seen by  individual atoms.  Metals produced by consolidation of
              very small  crystalline particles (10 to 30 atoms across), referred to as 
              nanophase metals, have significantly enhanced mechanical properties  compared
              to the naturally occuring material.  This work will apply  techniques of NMR to
              help understand the enhanced mechanical  properties from an atomic viewpoint. 
              This will aid in the  development of new materials and new uses for these
              materials.  The  NMR work is performed in conjunction with sample preparation 
              performed at Argonne National Laboratory.  ***
