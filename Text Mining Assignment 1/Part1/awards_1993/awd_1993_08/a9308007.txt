Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the mathematical foundations               
              of control theory of those partial differential equations, hybrid              
              and hereditary systems which arise in science and engineering.                 
              The issues to be addressed are robust control and stabilization                
              of such systems and their effective approximation by finite                    
              dimensional systems (usually governed by ordinary differential                 
              equations) together with facilitating computer algorithms.                     
                                                                                             
                   One of the main problems of structural mechanics is to                    
              dampen vibrations, or to control the motion, of highly flexible,               
              often very large, lightweight structures. This project is                      
              intended to design and analyze control mechanisms which stabilize              
              those infinite dimensional dynamical systems which model such                  
              structures. Feedback controls designed to achieve a certain                    
              performance level often contain unavoidable time delays due, for               
              example, to the time required to process the information required              
              to implement the control action. Another aspect of this research               
              will be the study of robustness of techniques of control system                
              analysis and synthesis of such "hereditary" systems to errors                  
              that may be involved in their modelling or approximation.
