Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With National Science Foundation support, the Peabody Museum of                
              Natural History at Yale University will computerize the records                
              which relate to its Caribbean archaeological collections. These                
              materials are now described under ca. 135,000 catalogue entries in             
              handwritten bound ledgers and this makes it extremely difficult for            
              researchers to locate either specific items or groups of materials.            
              Over a two year period museum professionals will enter these data              
              into a relational database system. As a result, the collections                
              will be made easily available to archaeologists who wish to work               
              with them                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Peabody's Caribbean archaeological collections are unparalled.             
              The material is the result of sixty years of systematic scientific             
              research in the islands of the West Indies and the coastal mainland            
              of Venezuela and the Guianas. It was excavated through research                
              conducted under the auspices of the Caribbean Anthropological                  
              program which was founded in 1933. These data allow researchers not            
              only to establish chronologies but also to trace migration and                 
              diffusion. The materials can also be used to reconstruct                       
              environment, cultural process and social dynamics. They therefore              
              constitute a valuable scientific data base.                                    
                                                                                             
              This project is important because at the present time this                     
              information is extremely difficult to use. With NSF support it will            
              be made readily available for scientific research.
