Abstract    :
              Cecilia Richards  Abstract    The objective of this research is to investigate
              the effect of  vortex dynamics on droplets dispersion, vaporization, and
              burning  in round jets.  The research will focus on the dispersion of drop  and
              their vapor by large-scale vortical structures in nonreacting  jet, and in
              reacting jets, and on the impact of droplet/eddy  interaction on the reacting
              flow structure.  An experimental study  of a turbulent jet with point source
              droplet stream injection using  planar imaging techniques, image analysis, and
              point measurements  of droplet and gas phase  statistics, will be performed.   
              This research will yield insight on the effect of vortex dynamics  on the
              structure and behavior of reacting two-phase flows,   data from this study will
              be directly applicable to improved design  of two-phase reacting devices, such
              as industrial furnaces, gas  turbine combustors, and hazardous waste
              incinerators.
