Abstract    :
              9308049  Rasche  This applicant will study the pathway of methyl transfer in the
               conversion of acetate to methane.  The enzyme catalyzing one of  the specific
              methyl group transfer steps will be purified and  characterized.  Antibodies
              will be generated to the enzyme and  immunogold labeling will be used to
              localize the enzyme in the  cell.  There are plans to clone and sequence the
              gene(s) for the  enzyme, and to analyze the deduced amino acid sequence by 
              searching appropriate databases for similar structures.  This  work will be
              conducted in the laboratory of Dr. James D. Ferry at  the Virginia Polytechnic
              Institute and State University.  ***
