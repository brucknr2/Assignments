Abstract    :
              9308660  Keeney  Regulations intended to reduce health and safety risks and 
              thereby reduce fatalities cost billions of dollars.  A crucial  question is
              whether the costs of some of these regulations induce  more fatalities than the
              regulations themselves avoid.  Several  aspects of this critical issue are
              addressed by the methodology  developed in this research.  Existing evidence
              indicates that  lower incomes are associated with higher mortality risks.  
              Previous work quantified the relationship between lower incomes  and higher
              mortality risks.  A model was developed for estimating  the number of
              fatalities induced by economic expenditures.  This  model indicated that,
              depending on the distribution of costs of  regulations throughout society, one
              fatality may be induced for  each $3 to $7.5 million cost of regulation.  This
              research will  extend the existing model.  Analyses will be performed to
              examine  the implications of using average census tract income data in 
              analyses using the model and to indicate whether the relationship  between
              lower incomes and increased fatalities has been changing  over the last forty
              years.  Because of the important role that  such results might play in policy
              decisions affecting the  allocation of billions of dollars to address public
              risks, the  proposed research will also address questions of how to 
              appropriately interpret and use the results of the research.  ***
