Abstract    :
              Orailoglu         This research is on automatic synthesis of fault-tolerant 
              micro-architectures.  Two areas are being investigated.  One is  an exploration
              of methodologies and CAD tools for synthesis of  self-recovering
              micro-architectures.  The model for self-  recovering designs is a flow-graph
              representation in which  partial results from two copies of the graph are
              periodically  compared at a checkpoint.  Research is on scheduling, allocation,
               binding, and checkpoint insertion.  The second is an  investigation of
              techniques automatic synthesis of fault-secure  micro-architectures.  Salient
              features of the research are:   algorithms for region delineation so as to
              ameliorate hardware  bottlenecks, and region scheduling so as to relax and
              weaken  precedence constraints between regions.
