Abstract    :
              9308659  Collins  The general aim of this research project is to understand the 
              process of maintaining erect posture.  The study involves the  analysis of the
              trajectory of the center-of-pressure recorded  during quiet stance.  The goal
              is to determine parameters that  can be extracted repetitively that
              characterized the open-loop  and closed-loop postural control mechanisms being
              used by an  individual.  Also, the effects of visual input and center-of- 
              pressure position feedback on the control mechanisms will be  investigated.   
              This study is important since it could lead to the development of  a clinically
              viable methodology for objectively and  quantitatively assessing the degree of
              postural stability changes  resulting from injury, disease and/or the aging
              process through a  simple, non-invasive test.  ***
