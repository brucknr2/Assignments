Abstract    :
                   This research program aims at developing the geometric                    
              foundations that underlie practically relevant properties of                   
              highly nonlinear control systems (that is, systems whose dynamics              
              are inadequately, or not at all, described by linear                           
              approximations). Highly oscillatory control variations will be                 
              examined with the goal of obtaining better criteria for                        
              controllability and optimality than presently exist, and to                    
              obtain new algorithms for stabilizing feedback laws. Methods from              
              algebraic combinatorics will be used to characterize the                       
              computational complexity of deciding controllability,                          
              stabilizability and other relevant control objectives and to                   
              develop new path planning algorithms.                                          
                   This project will develop the geometric foundations that                  
              underlie the dynamics of high-performance automatic control                    
              systems. It focuses primarily on systems that have very highly                 
              nonlinear dynamics and that have many interconnected components                
              influencing each other. The engineering demands for ever higher                
              performance, or even optimality, often require completely new                  
              control designs since classical linearization techniques for                   
              control design is often inadequate in such situations. By                      
              bringing together techniques from various areas of pure                        
              mathematics, such as differential geometry and algebraic                       
              combinatorics, new algorithms for finding optimal solutions to                 
              path planning problems (e.g., for robot arms or largely                        
              autonomously operating intelligent vehicles) will be developed.
