Abstract    :
                   The development of intelligent robot planning techniques is an            
              essential element of future underwater and space exploration and               
              industrial automation.  These technologies find application in                 
              autonomous underwater and planetary rovers, autonomous rendezvous              
              and docking, operation and maintenance of a nuclear power plant,               
              extravehicular activity, autonomous landers, robotic and                       
              telerobotic control and automation, and in the general construction            
              and operation of a laboratory, ship or industrial site.  The                   
              purpose of this project is to increase the efficiency and                      
              effectiveness of robot planning by making use of parallel hardware             
              and machine learning techniques.  The project is made up to two                
              component parts, each of which contributes independently and                   
              collectively to the automation of robotic activity.  The first                 
              subproject focuses on developing parallel algorithms for heuristic             
              search, which is a fundamental component in robot planning.  The               
              second subproject focuses on incremental modification and reuse of             
              plans by searching for similarities between old and new plans.                 
              These two projects have been developed and tested on several search            
              and planning problems.  We propose to extend the existing research             
              by improving the parallel search algorithms, developing parallel               
              planning algorithms, and applying dynamic graph match to allow                 
              reuse of plans in a dynamically changing environment.//
