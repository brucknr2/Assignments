Abstract    :
               Dynamic programming is one of the older general algorithmic  techniques that
              has been used widely in such diverse fields as  molecular biology, control
              theory, economics and operations  research, as well as in many areas in
              computer science, such as  computational geometry, string editing and VLSI
              layouts.  Until  recently, most applications were tackled with the general
              dynamic  programming technique.  Recent years have witnessed a renewed 
              interest in dynamic programming as researchers have begun to  uncover that many
              of these applications satisfy additional  conditions which can be exploited to
              yield significant  improvements in both the sequential and the parallel
              complexity  of some problems.  This project examines methods for speeding up
              the dynamic  programming technique.  The PI will work to significantly improve 
              the sequential and parallel solutions for classes of dynamic  programming
              problems, and seek to find ways to identify and  exploit extra constraints
              often found in many problems in a  class.  There will also be work on finding
              efficient solutions to  some specific problems that fit into the dynamic
              programming  framework.  These problems are important in their own right, and 
              furthermore, their solution should lead to useful insights in how to  handle
              the more general cases.
