Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with applications of the concepts              
              of multivariate conditional hazard rate functions, and of                      
              stochastic convexity and concavity, for the purpose of                         
              characterizing optimal allocation policies, stochastic orders and              
              aging in reliability theory.  In many applications in reliability              
              theory, the main interest lies not necessarily in the total                    
              lifetime of the components of the system, but in the total                     
              benefit delivered by the system during its lifetime.  This is                  
              particularly important when a limited resource is available for                
              enhancement of the components which make up the system.  Using                 
              the notions of majorization, stochastic convexity and stochastic               
              concavity, the optimal allocation policies will be sought.  The                
              performance of reliability components is often strongly                        
              influenced by the environment in which they function.  Using the               
              multivariate conditional hazard rate functions, it is possible to              
              mathematically model such environments in a relatively simple                  
              manner.                                                                        
                   This research is concerned with the applications of concepts              
              from statistics and probability for the purpose of characterizing              
              optimal allocation policies and aging in reliability theory.                   
              Performance of reliability components is often strongly                        
              influenced by the environment in which they function.                          
              Mathematical models will be described and analyzed, and optimal                
              policies for allocation of limited resources will be                           
              characterized.
