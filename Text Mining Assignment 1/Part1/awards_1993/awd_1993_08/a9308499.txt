Abstract    :
                   The objectives of the proposed research are:  1) to assess the            
              relative input of sediments from the Red Sea Hills to the Nile                 
              delta and thus, 2) to infer the degree and periodicity of                      
              paleoclimatic fluctuations in East Africa, particularly in the                 
              region closest to the mouth of the Nile.  The methods to be                    
              employed in the study include:  1) petrographic examination of one             
              hundred Red Sea Hills samples located in a collection at the                   
              Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History;p 2) determination            
              of characteristic 'marker minerals' originating in the Red Sea                 
              Hills with scanning electron microscopy, cathode luminescence, or              
              other as yet undetermined techniques; 3) identification of Red Sea             
              Hills minerals in already logged and dated cores from the Nile                 
              delta located at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural
