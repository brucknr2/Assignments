Abstract    :
              9308369  Hastie    The project will examine the effects of monetary incentives
              on the  performance of cognitive tasks.  The nature of the incentive 
              contingencies will be varied to create an experimental design to  compare the
              effect of large and small monetary payoffs in piece  rate, variable ratio,
              quota, and tournament incentive schemes,  including flat rate payment.  While
              some prior research has studied  these schemes, work tasks have not been
              standardized, so that it is  difficult to obtain a true assessment of each
              incentive scheme.  By  standardizing the task, it should be possible to obtain
              more  precise measurement of the effect of incentive on the detailed  worker
              behavior.  A comparative evaluation and integration  cognitive theory and
              models inspired by utility theory will be  conducted.  ***
