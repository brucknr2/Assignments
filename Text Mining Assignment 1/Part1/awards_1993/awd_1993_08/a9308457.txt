Abstract    :
                   The research investigates the specific aspects of algal food              
              quality that affect feeding and fecundity of herbivores.  While the            
              physiological condition of the algae is a critical factor                      
              influencing ingestion rates and reproduction, biochemical                      
              components of the algae are frequently not characterized or                    
              controlled.  To test the hypothesis that the major cellular                    
              constituents of algae vary with different limiting resources (N,P,             
              Si, light), the PIs will assess patterns of biochemical components             
              over a range of growth rates in three species of algae grown in                
              continuous cultures, under various resource limitations.  To test              
              whether algal biochemical composition affects the feeding and                  
              reproductive rates of herbivores, the PIs will measure fecundity               
              of Daphnia pulicaria with the various diets.  To assess if seasonal            
              variation in lipid production reflects changes in the quality of               
              phytoplankton, the PIs will monitor seasonal fluctuations of lipids            
              in algae and zooplankton in three lakes across a trophic gradient.             
              Food quality in aquatic ecosystems is highly dynamic.  The aim is              
              to identify the general patterns of accommodation of algae and                 
              herbivores to the variable resource base.
