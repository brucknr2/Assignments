Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a study of the incidence of racial violence in five                    
              southern states in the 1980s, exploiting the archives of the Center            
              for Democratic Renewal (CDR) to construct a data base.  First,                 
              nonconfidential CDR data on incidents of racial violence and the               
              public activities of white supremacist organizations will be coded             
              into machine-readable form.  Next, a county-level machine-readable             
              file of demographic, economic, and political statistics on each                
              county in the five state research region will be created, primarily            
              using the 1980 and 1990 censuses.  These files will be merged to               
              permit examination of factors that may predict such violence in the            
              1980s: local economic conditions, racial and ethnic composition,               
              activities of white supremacist organizations, rapid social change,            
              historical patterns of anti-black violence.                                    
                                                                                             
              The research will test sociological theories of racial violence,               
              thus contributing to scientific sociology in the fields of social              
              movements, race relations, and group conflict.  It will contribute             
              to the knowledge base for policy decisions concerning racial                   
              conflict in contemporary American society, and indirectly it will              
              help decision-makers understand the increasingly difficult problem             
              of ethnic violence world-wide.
