Abstract    :
              9308774  Titi             The low-dimensional dynamic behavior of infinite
              dimensional  systems is a field of intense mathematical research, and the 
              theoretical part of this work explores and builds on a number of  such
              directions.  The investigator and his colleagues study  several new aspects of
              the theory of inertial and approximate  inertial manifolds, and explore and
              establish new connections  between them and the method of empirical
              eigenfunctions.  At the  same time, a goal of the proposal is the computational
               implementation of the new methods and the study of certain  numerical analysis
              aspects associated with them (stability,  interaction with symmetries, and
              preservation of dissipation).       Dissipative time-dependent partial
              differential equations  arise from descriptions of a variety of important
              physical,  chemical, and biological phenomena.  The purpose of this project  is
              to develop, analyze, computationally implement, and test  methods for the
              reduction of such equations to accurate, small  dynamical systems.  This is a
              subject of intense research  interest in its own right; at the same time, it
              provides a bridge  to the study of many complex physicochemical and engineering
               systems, with important implications for the simulation,  analysis, prediction
              and control of their dynamic behavior.  An  integral part of this work is the
              application of the techniques  to models of realistic systems of current
              research interest, such  as pattern formation in catalytic and electrochemical
              reactions.   The investigator and his colleagues believe that the attempt to 
              tackle realistic problems strengthens the theoretical and  computational
              aspects of the research, and provides new ideas and  directions.
