Abstract    :
              9308839  Merickel  The goal of this project is to use a knowledge based method 
              to extract contours and surfaces from medical images, such  as magnetic
              resonance images.  The approach that is proposed  is a "top down" one that
              could be compared with the mental  processes used by radiologists instead of
              the more  traditional "bottom up" approach used in image segmentation.  The use
              of adaptive contours will be extended to 3-D  volumes.  The investigators will
              study two specific cases;  namely, vessel walls and brain regions.    This
              research will address a fundamental problem in image  processing and computer
              vision research.  For example, in  the biomedical area, image segmentation is
              important for the  quantitative and noninvasive analysis of tissue and 
              structure volumes, such as might be needed for the  evaluation of vessel
              integrity due to atherosclerosis and  brain structures for surgical planning.
