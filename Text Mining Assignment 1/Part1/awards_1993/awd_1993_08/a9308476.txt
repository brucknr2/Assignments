Abstract    :
              9308476  Pejcinovic  The proposed research will concentrate on investigating
              noise in photodetectors: its sources, magnitude, and effect on performance. 
              The research tool for this study is the Monte Carlo method tailored for the
              simulation of realistic devices.  This has the advantage that new device
              designs do not have to be manufactured before their performance can be
              examined; instead, their characteristics are simulated on a computer. The Monte
              Carlo method is a statistical method used to solve the Boltzmann transport
              equation and noise is directly calculated from the fluctuations of the
              underlying physical quantities: velocity and number of electrons or holes.  The
              method will first be calibrated on some simple devices and then applied to
              progressively more difficult and complex cases, including p-i-n photodiodes,
              avalanche photodiodes, and quantum well infrared photodetectors.  The
              advantages and disadvantages of each design will be examined and possible ways
              of improving the performance investigated.  Since noise can be very sensitive
              to the details of the physical models used in simulation, this study can also
              be used to learn more about properties of materials used for photodetectors.
