Abstract    :
              9311196  Ryan    This project will investigate why animals hatch when they
              hatch, and how the timing of hatching affects their survival.  An amphibian
              species, Agalychnis callidryas lay its eggs on plants overhanging ponds, and
              the tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch.  Tadpoles are able to hatch
              as early as 5 days old and will do so to escape from egg-eating snakes, if they
              are attacked.  Undisturbed tadpoles, however, usually delay hatching for
              several days.  They continue growing, inside the egg, and then they hatch they
              are less vulnerable to aquatic predators than are the smaller, early-hatching
              tadpoles.  The proposed research examines the effect on survival of
              developmental and behavioral flexibility in hatching, in the context of risks
              facing embryos and tadpoles.  %%%  Many animals live in different environments
              at different stages in their lives, and most animals hatch.  The problems
              facing animals making such changes are general, but in many systems only one of
              the two stages is accessible to study under natural conditions.  This study of
              the effects of changes in hatching time on both the eggs and larvae of the
              red-eyed treefrog will add to our understanding of behavior and ecology.  It
              will also provide detailed information on the ecology of this high profile
              rainforest species,  particularly its interactions with its predators at a
              crucial life stage.  ***    Small Format Large Format Large Capacity   Cassette
