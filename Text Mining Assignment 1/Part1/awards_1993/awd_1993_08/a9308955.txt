Abstract    :
              9308955  Norman  I propose to design and implement a scalable adaptive mesh 
              radiation hydrodynamics simulation code for use on MPP platforms.   This code
              will be quite general in the sense that can be used in  many astrophysical
              situations to solve "Grand Challenge" level  problems.  Additionally, the
              algorithm and code rely on the  solution of large parallel sets of equations, a
              situation for  which MPP computing technology is well suited.  My
              investigations  will be oriented towards developing schemes for the efficient 
              solution of these large parallel sets of equations.
