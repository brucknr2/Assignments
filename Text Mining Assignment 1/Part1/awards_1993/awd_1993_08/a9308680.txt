Abstract    :
              This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is                 
              made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Patricia A. Mabrouk of                   
              the Chemistry Department, Northeastern University.  Direct                     
              interfacial electron transfer of cytochrome c and related heme                 
              proteins in non-aqueous media will be investigated                             
              electrochemically.  Cyclic voltammetry and optical and circular                
              dichroism spectroscopies will be used to characterize the                      
              electrode substrate and explore the role of the protein's                      
              essential water.  Realization of interfacial electron transfer                 
              in this unconventional media may provide new insights into the                 
              native behavior of these proteins, but the long term goal of                   
              the work is to extend their biotechnological applications in                   
              sensors, electrochromic displays, and electrocatalysts.
