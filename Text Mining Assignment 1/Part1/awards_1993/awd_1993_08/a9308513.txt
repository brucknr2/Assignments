Abstract    :
              9308513   Alaghband   The analysis and prediction of performance of parallel
              programs  is the topic of this research proposal.  The measure of how well  a
              correctly running parallel program will perform on a given  architecture is a
              complex task which requires an in-depth  knowledge of parallel algorithm
              design, programming language, and  the underlying system and architecture.   
              The focus of this work  is on generation of a model based software tool for
              analyzing and  extrapolating the performance of programs written in a specific 
              parallel language.
