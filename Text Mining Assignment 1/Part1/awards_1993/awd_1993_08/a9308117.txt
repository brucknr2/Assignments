Abstract    :
                   Einstein's field equations, besides providing the basis                   
              for the best current description of the behavior of                            
              gravitational physics on the astrophysical and cosmological                    
              scale, also is the source of a rich collection of                              
              mathematically interesting questions.  Prof. Isenberg will                     
              investigate several of these, including:                                       
                   1.  solutions of the Einstein constraint equations of a                   
                   more general character than currently known                               
                   2.  occurrence of singularities in solutions to                           
                   Einstein's equations (i.e. the so-called "Strong Cosmic                   
                   Censorship" conjecture)                                                   
                   3.  the relationship between mathematical manifolds and                   
                   their geometries (i.e. "Ricci flows")                                     
                   This work will increase the interaction of ideas and                      
              tools in mathematics and theoretical physics.
