Abstract    :
              9303913  Sylvester, Arthur G.  This project is to resurvey a precise level line
              across the Teton  Fault, Wyoming, to characterize the interseismic activity of
              a  major normal fault, to compare the results of that survey with  previous
              surveys of the line in 1988, 1989, and 1991 to determine  if aseismic
              displacement we observed in the three previous surveys  is still continuing. 
              The significance of the research is that it  will show if aseismic vertical
              creep, previously unknown on dip  slip faults, at least in the United States,
              is occurring along one  of the master, active faults in western North America. 
              If it is  occurring, then that conclusion would affect interpretations of 
              paleoseismic slip inferred from trench excavations across dip slip  faults,
              especially along Basin and Range faults.
