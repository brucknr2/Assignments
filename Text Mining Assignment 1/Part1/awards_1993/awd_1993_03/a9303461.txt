Abstract    :
              The  proposed  work  is  to  develop, implement  and  evaluate  a  temporal 
              planning algorithm (called ZENO) which handles  actions  with  conditional 
              effects  and  universal  quantification,  real  duration, continuous change,
              synergistic effects, domain  axioms,  and   external  events.   In  addition 
              ZENO  will  reason  about  simultaneous   actions  which  are  potentially 
              synergistic   or  interferent.  The formal and empirical objectives are proving
              the  algorithm  is  both sound and complete, yet finding methods  that  are  
              efficient enough for practical use.  To achieve these  aims  the   techniques
              in the UCPOP planner will be extended with ideas  from   qualitative  physics,
              operations research  and  constraint  logic    programming.   In  particular, 
              a  metric  and  temporal  constraint   satisfaction  engine  is  envisioned 
              based  on  the  incremental Simplex  algorithm.
