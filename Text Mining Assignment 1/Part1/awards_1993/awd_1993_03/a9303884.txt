Abstract    :
              9303884  Vanyo      The PI will measure liquid motions in a filled oblate
              spheroid having the Earth's core-mantle boundary ellipticity during spin and
              precession scaled to the luni-solar induced precession of the mantle. 
              Experimental techniques will trace interior (3-D) flows and surface secondary
              flows due to Ekman layer pumping.  Instabilities and development of turbulence
              will be delineated.  An equivalent diameter sphere will also be developed to
              approximate the observed flows, and the resulting data will be compared to
              buoyancy induced convection and to analytical geodynamo requirements.  ****
