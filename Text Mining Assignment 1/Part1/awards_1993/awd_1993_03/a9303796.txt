Abstract    :
                This research is to define by gravity and active seismic                     
              refraction methods the subsurface structure of the Salt Lake                   
              Valley, Utah, model the resulting structure in a 3-D finite element            
              code for response to earthquake waves, and compare the result with             
              recorded data from earthquakes.  The research is expected to                   
              provide a new understanding of the competing interactions among the            
              effects of attenuation, topographic scattering, basin resonance,               
              body-to-surface wave conversion at basin boundaries, and coda                  
              enhancement.  The topographic scattering results will be applied               
              to dam sites in the Wasatch Range, Utah, to determine if                       
              conventional earthquake response design criteria are adequate.                 
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
