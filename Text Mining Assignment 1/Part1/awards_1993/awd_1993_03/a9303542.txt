Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from            
              University of Kentucky.  His Ph.D. research was in plant virology.             
              He plans to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the              
              laboratory of Dr. Michael Clegg at University of California at                 
              Riverside.  The proposed research entitled "CaMV-mediated reverse              
              transcription and encapsidation of heterologous plant RNAs" will               
              broaden the training of the Fellow into molecular evolution.
