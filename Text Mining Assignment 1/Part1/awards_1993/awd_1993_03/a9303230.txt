Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with the study of algebras with                   
              trace functions and their trace identities.  Of special interest               
              are associated universal algebras and their Poincare series.                   
              Invariant theory will be an important tool.  The principal                     
              investigator is interested in determining why so many universal                
              polynomial identity algebras with trace occur as fixed rings for               
              important groups, Lie algebras and super Lie algebras.                         
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring              
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                           
              multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                 
              satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                 
              not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                         
              multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                     
              matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                 
              has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing              
              significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.
