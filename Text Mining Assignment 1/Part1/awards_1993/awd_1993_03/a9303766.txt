Abstract    :
                    The theme for this Gordon Research conference is Advances in             
              Modeling and Novel Applications of Crystal Growth Methods.   Its               
              scope will be covered by 9 sessions, 24 speakers, and 11 discussion            
              leaders.  Formal sessions will be augmented by poster                          
              presentations, numbering about 20.  Official language is English.              
              The planned program includes sessions on Crystal Growth                        
              Fundamentals; Crystal Growth & Defects in High Tc Cuprate                      
              Superconductors;  Oxide Crystals; Characterization of Advanced                 
              Photonic Crystals; Wide Band Gap Semiconductor Crystal Growth;                 
              Atomic Ordering and Scanning Probe Microscopy; and Doping Phenomena            
              in III-V and II-VI Multinary Semiconductor Crystals.  Speakers                 
              include experts from U.S., European, and Japanese institutions.

                    This proposal is for the support of the Gordon Research                  
              Conference on Advances in Modeling and Novel Applications of                   
              Crystal Growth Methods.  Speakers include experts from the U.S.,               
              European, and Japanese institutions.  Knowledge information                    
              exchange under this format can enhance the progress in the areas               
              covered in this Conference.
