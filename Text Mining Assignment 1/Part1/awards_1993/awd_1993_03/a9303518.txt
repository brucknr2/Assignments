Abstract    :
              9303518  Reynolds    This research examines the fundamental mechanisms governing
               precipitate morphology in metal alloys.  The measurement of growth  ledge
              nucleation  kinetics as a function of interphase boundary  orientation provides
              necessary information to unify two current  theories for the development of
              precipitate morphology: the general  theory for precipitate morphology, which
              relates precipitate shape  to boundary mobilities, and the invariant line
              theory, which  predicts precipitate orientation relationships, growth
              directions,  and habit planes from the crystallography of the phases involved. 
               Experimental observation of the misfit dislocation structures at 
              precipitate/matrix boundaries during growth in a nickel-chromium  alloy
              provides information on mechanisms by which partially  coherent boundaries
              migrate in solids.  %%%  The long term benefit of the research is understanding
              of the  physical processes responsible for microstructural evolution, which 
              guides improvement in commercial metal alloys.  ***
