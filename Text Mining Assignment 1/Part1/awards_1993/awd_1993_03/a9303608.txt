Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from            
              Iowa State University and his Ph.D. research was in plant genetics.            
              He plans to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the              
              laboratory of Dr. Michael Freeling at University of California at              
              Berkeley.  The proposed research entitled "Transposon tagging of               
              narrow leaf/bladeless mutants of maize" will broaden the training              
              of the Fellow into plant molecular biology and developmental                   
              biology.
