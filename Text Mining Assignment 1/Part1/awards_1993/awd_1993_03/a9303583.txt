Abstract    :
                9303583  Scheuermann        This is the first year funding of a three-year
              continuing award.   Large arrays of small disks provide an attractive approach
              for high  performance systems since they allow for low-cost, reliable storage 
              and can achieve higher throughput compared to large disks.  This  project
              proposes to develop an integrated set of algorithms and an  intelligent file
              manager which is applicable to any multi-disk  architecture in which the
              operating system can access the disks  independently.  The emphasis of the
              approach is on the use of  modular building blocks for file partitioning,
              allocation, load  balancing, and reorganization that can be invoked
              independently of  each other.  Thus, the procedure for load balancing can be
              called  regardless of whether striping or declustering is employed and does 
              not depend upon the unit of declustering.  The development of a  generalized
              method for load balancing is considered which can be  applied to an environment
              where some files exhibit periodical  access patterns and which considers
              explicitly the cost of  performing the cooling actions.  The investigation also
              focuses on  reorganization procedures that perform restriping when higher 
              performance standards need to be enforced.  The anticipated results  of this
              project are of importance to massively parallel computers  to support
              scalability and to ensure that the I/O is not the  limiting factor in achieving
              high speedup.   ***
