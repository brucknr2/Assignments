Abstract    :
                   The investigator wishes to continue with his developments of              
              aspects of sumanifold theory and the geometry of hypersurfaces in              
              Riemannian geometry.  Particular attention will be paid to those               
              hypersurfaces where the principal curvature function has constant              
              multiplicity.  Incorporated in the program is the support of an                
              undergraduate research assistant who will be writing a                         
              dissertation under the investigator's directorship.
