Abstract    :
                   The research entails analytic problems on classes of                      
              conformally compact manifolds and manifolds inheriting partial                 
              complex structures (Cauchy-Riemann manifolds).  The techniques in              
              question evolve from variational principles and the geometry of                
              Einstein metrics.  This research has potential applications to                 
              mathematical physics, particularly general relativity and quantum              
              gravity.
