Abstract    :
              9303104  Bonnell       This scanning tunneling/atomic force microscope will be
              used  in a variety of materials investigations.  Several investigators  have
              carried out preliminary studies which indicate that  significant progress in
              their research could be made with regular  access to an STM/AFM.  The research
              topics include relating  deformation as manifest in surface roughness to
              mechanisms of local  plasticity at metal/ceramic interfaces, cleavage fracture
              in high  strength intermetallic alloys, and structure and formation of self- 
              assembled organic monolayers.  Included are projects on surface  interactions
              on medical implant materials, reactivity of metal  oxide surfaces for catalytic
              applications, dynamic embrittlement in  metals, and structural studies of
              biological materials.  The  objective of this facility is to provide high
              spatial resolution  imaging for a wide range of materials in a single
              multicapability  instrument.  This microscope will complement our other UHV
              surface  analytical and electron microscopy facilities.
