Abstract    :
              9303814  Hovis  This research project will focus on energies of mineral 
              processes.  Aspects of particular interest include the  energies of mixing in
              ternary feldspars and the nepheline-  kalsilite system as determined by
              investigating the  enthalpies and volumes of K-Na mixing, the Gibbs energies 
              and entropies of mixing for nepheline-kalsilite as yielded  by phase
              equilibrium (solvus) measurements, the dependence  of enthalpies and volumes of
              mixing, normally assumed to be  constant with T and P, on these variables, and
              the energies  associated with other mineral processes such as order-  disorder
              in orthopyroxenes and exsolution in alkali  feldspars.  The major techniques to
              be utilized include  solution calorimetry, drop calorimetry, and room- and
              high-  temperature x-ray powder diffraction.
