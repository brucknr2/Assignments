Abstract    :
              9303520  Davies  This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research  collaboration
              between Professor Frederick Davies of  Texas A&M University and Professor V.
              Olalde Portugal  of the Biotechnology Institute (CIVESTAV) at Irapuato,  and
              Professors H. Escamilla and H. Chirinos of the  Monterrey Institute of
              Technology (ITESM) in Mexico.   The researchers intend to collect and screen
              Mexican  mycorrhizal isolates for enhanced drought resistance  of pepper
              plants, and determine how drought resistance  mechanisms in the
              pepper-mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis  differ among selected mycorrhizal isolates.
                   Scientists at the Biotechnology Institute in Irapuato  and at ITESM have
              been collecting beneficial  mycorrhizal fungi from arid sites in Mexico that
              have  potential promise for increasing plant drought  resistance.  The U.S.
              investigator has shown that  mycorrhizal fungi will enhance drought resistance
              of  pepper plants.  Their collaboration should increase  our understanding of
              the mechanisms of drought  resistance and allow the development of superior 
              strains of fungi that enhance water relations and  yield of pepper plants under
              reduced irrigation  regimes.  ***
