Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with efficient numerical solution               
              of the dynamics of large groups of particles or bodies                         
              interacting under the forces of nature. Many-body and                          
              many-particle systems are encountered, for example, in studies of              
              the dynamics of biological macromolecules, in drug design, in the              
              simulation of plasmas, in vehicle and space-structure simulation,              
              and in cosmology.  Related problems arise through spatial                      
              semidiscretization of time-dependent partial differential                      
              equations. By looking beyond the application-specific features of              
              the various codes and numerical techniques, this project will                  
              seek new, broadly applicable mathematical and computational tools              
              for dynamical simulations.                                                     
                   The focus of the mathematical study will be on preserving                 
              and exploiting Hamiltonian structure in the equations of motion,               
              e.g. by using new symplectic discretization schemes. The project               
              will broaden the current research dialogue among numerical                     
              analysts by considering constrained Hamiltonian systems and                    
              nearly Hamiltonian systems. Methods suited to implementation on                
              parallel computers will be sought. At all stages, computational                
              efficiency and practicality will be emphasized over mere                       
              mathematical novelty, and an experimental approach consistent                  
              with the tradition of the physical sciences will be adopted.
