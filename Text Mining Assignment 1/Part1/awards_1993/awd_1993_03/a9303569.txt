Abstract    :
              This is a project to maintain and augment as necessary, the network            
              of nearly fifty automatic weather stations established on the                  
              antarctic continent and on several surrounding islands.  These                 
              weather stations measure surface wind, pressure, temperature,                  
              humidity, and in some instances other atmospheric variables, such              
              as snow accumulation and incident solar radiation, and report these            
              via satellite to a number of ground stations.  The data are used               
              for operational weather forecasting in support of the United States            
              Antarctic program, for climatological records, and for research                
              purposes.  The AWS network, which began as a small-scale program in            
              1980, has been extremely reliable and has proven indispensable for             
              both forecasting and research purposes.
