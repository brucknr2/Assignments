Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The analysis of fecal steroids is a developing technique of                    
              potential importance in the field of primate reproductive biology              
              and socioecology.  It should allow for the monitoring of                       
              reproductive states of animals - whether or not they are                       
              ovulating, for example.  Coupled with behavioral observations,                 
              this technique will enable the formulation and testing of much                 
              more sophisticated and incisive hypotheses in the field.                       
                                                                                             
              This dissertation project is directed by an excellent senior                   
              scientist and will involve collaboration and training with a                   
              leader in this developing field.  It will also provide important               
              information on the ecology and preservation of primates.
