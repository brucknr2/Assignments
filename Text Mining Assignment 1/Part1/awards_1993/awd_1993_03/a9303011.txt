Abstract    :
                Normalization, matching, and unification are three   computational steps found
              in virtually all symbolic   computation  systems.  Applications of these
              operations include term  rewriting,   functional, equational  and logic
              programming  languages, abstract data type   specification and  verification, 
              automated deduction, code generation, type   inferencing, and  computer
              algebra.  This project addresses these problems in   computing and the means to
              design and  analyze efficient   algorithms for them.  Practical algorithms are
              designed on both sequential and   parallel machines.  Algorithms  which learn
              efficiently from their history are   designed for  normalization with respect
              to several important and useful    classes of rewrite  systems.  Several facets
              of matching and  unification   problems are studied  from a novel perspective. 
              Algorithms that correlate   information from previous  match/unify  operations
              are designed for tree pattern   matching and its  interpreted versions, and
              subterm unification and  its    interpreted versions.  The practical
              performance of these  algorithms is   investigated.  This  research is useful
              in enhancing the efficiency of symbolic   systems as well as provide
              understanding of the inherent    complexities of these  operations.
