Abstract    :
              9303032   Gardella    This research deals with studies directed at understanding
              the  structure and reactivity of polymer surfaces.  A special focus of  the
              research program is emphasis on refining surface-sensitive  spectroscopic
              measurements to derive structure, bonding, and  reactivity information from
              macromolecular surfaces.  In  particular, model systems are constructed by
              Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)  techniques to determine the qualitative and
              quantitative  capabilities, and sampling depths of Secondary Ion Mass 
              Spectrometry (SIMS), High Resolution Electron Energy Loss  Spectrometry
              (HREELS), and angle and energy dependant Electron  Spectroscopy for Chemical
              Analysis (ESCA or X-Ray Photoelectron  Spectroscopy, XPS).  Results from SIMS,
              ESCA and infrared  spectroscopic methods are combined with surface energetics,
              thermal  analysis, electron microscopy, and other more established methods  in
              addressing three general problems in polymer surface science.   One focus is to
              provide quantitative descriptions of the surface  reactivity of thin molecular,
              monomer, and polymer films prepared  by LB and "self-assembly" methods.  A
              second group of projects aims  to describe the near-surface composition and
              structure of selected  multicomponent and multiphase polymers, especially those
              which are  phase separated.  Emphasis is placed on determining the effects of 
              preparation and evaluating the composition as a function of depth.   The third
              area of investigation involves surface chemical  modification of fluoropolymers
              using both low-wattage plasmas and  chemical reactions.  The studies for the
              next three-year period  build on the previous work, and the new research
              program will  emphasize the use of quantitative SIMS methods study interfacial 
              polymer chemistry.    This research aims to develop quantitative methods of
              measuring the  composition of polymer surfaces.  This type of information in 
              essential for an understanding of such applications as adhesion and 
              biocompatibility.  ***
