Abstract    :
              A calculus of operations are being developed to facilitate maintenance of
              programs by non-specialist programmers.  Operations are to be performed on an
              "enhancement structure" of a program rather than the (more complicated) program
              text.  Enhancement structures are based on the methodology of stepwise
              enhancement developed under a previous NSF grant.  This continuation award
              includes a supplement to support research experience for an undergraduate
              participant.  %%%  Previously a tool, PT, was built to support the major steps
              of stepwise enhancement, applying techniques to skeletons, and composition of
              programs enhanced from the skeleton.  Enhancement structures have now been
              defined formally.  The specific task to be performed by the undergraduate
              student is to enhance PT to directly manipulate enhancement structures.  The
              maintenance operations would be performed directly on the enhancement
              structures, rather than by reapplying operations directly on programs as is the
              case currently.
