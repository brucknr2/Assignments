Abstract    :
              Professor Freiser and his students will investigate the                        
              fundamental processes involved in liquid-liquid solvent                        
              extraction of metal species.  This project in the area of                      
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry will involve kinetic and                      
              thermodynamic studies of solvent extraction mechanisms.                        
              Spectroscopic structural probes will be used to study the exact                
              role of the liquid-liquid interface in solvent extraction                      
              separations.  The results obtained from this investigation will                
              be used to optimize extraction schemes as well as develop new                  
              analytical methods for the separation and extraction of metal                  
              compounds from analytical samples.

              This project involves an extensive investigation of the                        
              fundamental mechanisms governing the liquid-liquid extraction                  
              of metals as metal ion chelate complexes.  Such investigations                 
              are particularly significant because liquid-liquid solvent                     
              extraction is a commercially important technique for the                       
              separation and recovery of heavy metals.  The results of this                  
              investigation will help to elucidate the mechanisms of similar                 
              processes such as liquid partition and micellar chromatography,                
              membrane-based ion selective electrode responses and transport                 
              processes in biomembranes.
