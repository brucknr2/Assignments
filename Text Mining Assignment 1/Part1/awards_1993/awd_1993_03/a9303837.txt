Abstract    :
              9303837  Keimer    The goal of this project is to develop a detailed microscopic
               description of the effects of magnetic fields on the static and  dynamic
              lattice distortions of materials with quasi-one dimensional  electronic
              structures.  Using a superconducting split-coil magnet  system capable of
              generating magnetic fields up to 13T, high-  resolution x-ray scattering
              experiments will be performed on  compounds exhibiting spin-Peierls and
              spin-density wave phases at  low temperatures.  Phenomena to be investigated
              include field-  induced nonmagnetic-magnetic transition in insulating and 
              conducting spin-Peierls systems, the effect of magnetic fields on  the
              structure of semimetallic charge density wave compounds, and  possible
              magnetostructural effects in field induced spin density  wave phases.  The
              structural information derived from these  experiments will contribute to a
              quantitative understanding in  correlated quasi-one dimensional electron
              systems.  In particular,  the microscopic origin of field-induced transitions
              in such  compounds will be clarified.  %%%  This project will develop a unique
              facility which combines high-  precision x-ray structure facilities with a very
              high magnetic  field in which samples can be cooled to ultralow temperatures. 
              In  the presence of a magnetic field, the structural, magnetic and  electronic
              properties change and new phases of the materials are  encountered.  The nature
              of these phase changes is not well  understood, and essentially no prior
              experiments have been  performed, owing to lack of facilities.  The results of
              the  research will be of fundamental importance to the fields of  magnetism and
              electronic properties of materials.  ***
