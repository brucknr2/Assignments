Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Miami will operate the R/Vs ISELIN and CALANUS               
              during 1993 as general oceanographic vessels in support of NSF-                
              sponsored research projects.  The R/V ISELIN is a 170' general                 
              research vessel owned and constructed by the University of Miami.              
              Although the vessel is capable of world-wide oceanography it sails             
              mainly in the Atlantic.  In 1993 it will work off the northeast                
              coast of the U.S. from April until July.  The ISELIN will do two               
              cruises off Bermuda in July, followed by two in the Bahamas and                
              Caribbean in August and September.  The final cruise will be in                
              October and November off the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific.                 
                                                                                             
              The R/V CALANUS is a 68' general research vessel owned by the                  
              University of Miami.  The Calanus normally sails off the coast of              
              Florida on short cruises.  In 1993 Calanus will do a series of                 
              short cruises interspersed with two cruises in the Bahamas and one             
              in the Gulf of Mexico.                                                         
                                                                                             
              These vessels are part of a fleet used by NSF to support                       
              oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research requires                  
              highly specialized equipment that must be permanently installed on             
              a ship for which the ship must be specifically designed.  This                 
              equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance            
              and operation.  These vessels do not operate in the same manner as             
              general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore NSF supports the                   
              operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to                    
              oceanographic research that are operated by universities and                   
              research institutions and around the country.
