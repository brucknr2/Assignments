Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from            
              Texas A&M University.  His Ph.D. research was in the area of plant             
              developmental biology with strong protein chemistry backround.  He             
              plans to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the                 
              laboratory of Dr. Scott Emer at University of California at San                
              Diego.  The proposed research entitled "Arabidopsis homologs for               
              yeast genes encoding a protein complex for vacuolar protein                    
              sorting" will broaden the training of the Fellow into molecular                
              genetics and cell biology.
