Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the chemistry of both naturally                  
              occurring and synthetic organosulfur compounds. Continuing                     
              research on the constituents of the Allium family, which                       
              contains garlic and onions and their allies, will address the                  
              question of optical activity of primary flavorants and the role                
              of enzymes in their formation. The invention of new reagents                   
              and methods for organic synthesis will include those based on                  
              the Ramberg-Backland reaction and their application to new                     
              routes to cyclopentadienes and 1,3-eneynes. The total synthesis                
              of unusual physiologically active organosulfur natural products                
              and unnatural sulfur compounds will be carried out. The                        
              microwave spectroscopy of highly reactive small organosulfur                   
              compounds will be studied. Synthesis of new polythiols of                      
              interest as ligands and/or in material science will be carried                 
              out.                                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Eric Block of the Department of                 
              Chemistry at SUNY Albany, who will study both naturally                        
              occurring and synthetic organosulfur compounds. In the natural                 
              product area, the emphasis will be on the highly labile                        
              compounds which account for the odor and flavor of the Allium                  
              family which includes garlic and onions. In the synthetic area,                
              organosulfur compounds will be utilized in for the production                  
              of new compounds useful in sequestering heavy metals or in the                 
              synthesis of new materials.
