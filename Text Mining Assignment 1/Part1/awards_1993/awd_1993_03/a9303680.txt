              of daily operations and the training of  students and professional staff in the
              use of the electron  microprobe. In its four years of operation to date the
              electron   microprobe instrument at Oregon State University has provided 
              state-of-the-art microanalyses to over sixty materials research  groups and has
              trained students drawn from nine departments in six  colleges.  ***
