Abstract    :
              9303825  Smith       It is known that orography exerts an important influence on
               atmospheric motions.  It is considered to be crucial that the  effects of
              mountains be properly included in numerical prediction  models whether they
              focus on climate, synoptic, regional or local  weather.  In previous research
              on this topic, the Principal  Investigator has been instrumental in advancing
              fundamental  knowledge of atmospheric flows around mountains and the influence 
              of these flows on the atmosphere.         The Principal Investigator will
              attempt to determine the  nature of the transition between three-dimensional
              laminar mountain  wave flows and mountain flows with dissipation and wakes. 
              Using  numerical models and observational studies, the Principal  Investigator
              will further refine the conditions under which  different atmospheric flows
              occur near mountains.   ***
