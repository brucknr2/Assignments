Abstract    :
              Qualified, active ocean scientists from developing countries will              
              participate in a series of planning workshops and international                
              scientific meetings relevant to their particular area of expertise,            
              to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) and of                  
              interest to the National Science Foundation.  Travel awards will be            
              provided through the SCOR Secretariat to attend meetings that                  
              relate to SCOR activities.  This program provides an effective                 
              mechanism for establishing contacts between oceanographers from                
              developed and developing nations.  Project objectives include:                 
              broadening traditional participation in ocean-related international            
              scientific meetings to include more scientists from developing                 
              countries; to enhance the exchange of detailed regional knowledge              
              or expertise in planning for large-scale oceanographic experiments;            
              and to provide greater opportunities leading to the involvement of             
              developing countries in international collaborative programs, such             
              as JGOFS and GLOBEC.
