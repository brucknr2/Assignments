Abstract    :
                   Hajian and Eigen will study ergodic measure preserving                    
              transformations defined on an infinite measure space and the                   
              effect these transformations have on unsolved problems of                      
              additive number theory.  They also will investigate the spectral               
              measure of an ergodic transformation.  The intent is to extend                 
              some of the classical results on Riesz products to the                         
              Generalized Riesz products which arise from ergodic                            
              transformations.                                                               
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics"                  
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
