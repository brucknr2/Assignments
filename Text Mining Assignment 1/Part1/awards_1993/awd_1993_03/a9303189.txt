Abstract    :
              9303189  Wise       This award provides infrastructure for the support of 
              Conceptualization and Visualization of Computation.  The equipment  supported
              includes high performance graphical workstations, a  parallel computer, and
              high speed networking facilities.  The  faculty involved in the project are
              drawn from the department of  Computer Science but have substantial
              collaborations with  computational scientists and engineers at Indiana
              University.         The research supported by this infrastructure includes 
              automated theorem proving, circuit validation, parallel functional 
              programming, scientific visualization, visualization of Monte Carlo  methods,
              visualization of processor utilization on scalable  architectures, visual
              programming, and visual performance  monitoring and analysis.
