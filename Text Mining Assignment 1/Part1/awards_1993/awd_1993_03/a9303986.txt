Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at San                 
              Jose State University will purchase Sun 10 workstations which                  
              will be dedicated machines in support of research in the                       
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for research                
              projects in algebra, in particular group theory and number                     
              theory.
