Abstract    :
                   The research entails applications of geometric and analytic               
              techniques to moduli problems in conformal field theory, mainly                
              on Riemann surfaces.  This topic is regarded with great                        
              importance in modern mathematical physics and lends itself to a                
              deeper understanding of the large scale structure of space-time                
              and vortex phenomena.
