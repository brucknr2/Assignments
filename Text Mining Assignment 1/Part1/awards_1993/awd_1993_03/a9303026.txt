Abstract    :
              Research will be conducted on the circulation of Arctic Ocean water            
              masses and will be carried out under the auspices of the ARCSS/OAII            
              global change research program.  This work will investigate the                
              input of shelf water from the Barents, Kara, and Laptev seas of the            
              Arctic Ocean into the subsurface water masses of the Eurasian Basin            
              and investigate the circulation of these subsurface water masses               
              along the continental slope in this region.  These objectives will             
              be met by measuring anthropogenic halocarbons on samples collected             
              during the summer and autumn 1993 cruise of the German Research                
              icebreaker POLARSTERN.   Shelf waters will have a relatively high              
              anthropogenic halocarbon signal because they interact extensively              
              with the atmosphere.  The halocarbon distributions will be used to             
              determine locations of shelf water inflow, to investigate formation            
              of subsurface water masses in the Eurasian Basin by mixing between             
              shelf waters and deep water, and to investigate the transport of               
              newly formed subsurface water masses in the deep cyclonic boundary             
              current that has been postulated to flow around the Eurasian Basin.            
              This work will be carried out in conjunction with several German               
              investigators.  The research objectives address the ARCSS research             
              priority area of Circulation of the Arctic Ocean.
