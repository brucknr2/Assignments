Abstract    :
              9303403  Salzberg    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   Commercial relational database management systems provide many  robust
              customer-tested utilities and services.  Not only can  traditional queries be
              answered efficiently, but also  reorganization, recovery, concurrency, report
              writing, performance  monitoring, distribution, importing and exporting
              utilities are  available.  It makes sense to add features to these mature
              products  to support new applications rather than to write new software for 
              new applications and then try to add these complex utilities.  This  project
              adds to relational database management systems support for  versions of complex
              objects.  It provides indexing on both time and  version name.  In addition,
              hierarchical objects composed of  different record types (such as customer and
              order) can be  dynamically clustered as they are entered in the database.  This
               will enable customers dealing with hierarchical and/or versioned  objects to
              take advantage of the robust capabilities of already  existing large database
              management systems.   ***
