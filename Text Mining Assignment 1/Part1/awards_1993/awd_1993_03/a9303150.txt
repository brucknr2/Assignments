Abstract    :
              9303150  Cohen       This award is for the acquisition of a parallel computer
              and  several high performance work stations to support research in the 
              Computer Science Department of Brandeis University.  The department  is engaged
              in three major areas of research:  Parallelism and  Languages, Data
              Compression, and Artificial Intelligence.  The  department is part of the
              Brandeis Center for Complex Systems and  the theme of parallelism and the study
              of large complex systems is  common to all three groups.         The research
              topics to be explored by the parallel programming  group include the design and
              analysis of parallel algorithms; and  the design and implementation of high
              level parallel languages  which facilitate the rapid construction of programs
              that can easily  be verified to be correct and which can be compiled to run 
              efficiently on MIMD and SIMD machines.  Research topics of the data 
              compression group include adaptive vector quantization with  variable size
              vectors, adaptive video compression, issues in coding  theory that include
              error resilient communication, the design of  high speed data compression
              hardware, and context prediction for  lexicography.  Research topics for the AI
              group include data  extraction from existing databases and text corpora, the
              role of  memory in storing extracted data, and the construction of  integrated
              agents that are data driven and exhibit goal directed  behavior.
