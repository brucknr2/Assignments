Abstract    :
                   This project addresses three important aspects of the                     
              neotectonics of the Himalayan foothills and adjacent plains                    
              of India-the long-term slip rate on the plate boundary                         
              fault, the recurrence interval for great Himalayan-front                       
              earthquakes and the amount of strain released within the                       
              Himalaya rather than the Himalayan front.  The work involves                   
              construction of balanced sections using surface outcrops,                      
              drilling and seismic reflection profiles, mapping of                           
              Quaternary deposits, trenching and geomorphic analysis of                      
              river profiles.  This research is in collaboration with the                    
              Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology and the Oil and Natural                   
              Gas Commission of India.  Results are a fundamental interest                   
              and of considerable utility in assessment of potential                         
              earthquake hazards in the Himalayan Foothills of northwest                     
              India.
