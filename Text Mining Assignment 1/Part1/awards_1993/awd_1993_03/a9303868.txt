Abstract    :
              9303868  Fischer       The goal of the project is to develop effective trellis
              source  codes and structured vector quantizers. The trellis codes are 
              constructed to use trellis coded quantization to achieve  significant granular
              gain, and trellis boundary shaping to achieve  significant boundary (entropy)
              gain. The main objectives of the  research are to develop a theory for
              analyzing the performance of  the trellis codes, and develop efficient
              algorithms for the code  design. The method will also be extended to develop
              trellis codes  for sources with memory.       Two classes of structured vector
              quantizers are developed for  low-delay source coding applications. The first
              class is a  two-stage vector quantizer/lattice vector quantizer, with 
              soft-decision first-stage encoding. Preliminary results indicate  that this
              vector quantizer structure, while simple, provides  performance (for memoryless
              sources) that is competitive with, or  superior, to all other existing
              techniques. The second class of  vector quantizers is lattice-based, with an
              elliptical boundary  region. The main objective is to develop efficient
              algorithms  defining the vector quantizer so that it can be made adaptive. The 
              elliptical vector quantizer will be evaluated in a speech coding  system.  ***
