Abstract    :
              9303385  Klusman       It is proposed to measure methane and non-methane
              hydrocarbon  (NMHC) fluxes from the earth in sedimentary basins with a focus on
               arid and semiarid environments.  The microseepage phenomenon is  widespread,
              though not generally recognized as a significant  contribution to the
              atmospheric loading by hydrocarbons.  Saturated  hydrocarbons, particularly
              methane, make a significant contribution  to the absorption of infrared
              radiation from the earth.  The 14C  activity of the atmosphere sets an upper
              limit to the contribution  of methane from all fossil fuel sources in the range
              of 20-30%.   Presumably nearly all of the C2-C5 saturated hydrocarbons in the 
              atmosphere are from fossil fuel sources.  Research to date  attributes the
              fossil fuel contribution entirely to man-induced  leakage and pollution, but
              has not measured the natural  microseepage rates in the environments where it
              is likely to occur.       The proposal is to measure the natural fluxes of CH4
              and NMHC  in several sedimentary basins in the western United States using  gas
              chromatography the basins selected are known to have a wide  range of
              concentrations of hydrocarbons in soil gas.  The fluxes  are expected to be
              proportional to the soil gas concentrations.   The research in the first year
              will concentrate on preliminary  estimates of fluxes using flux chamber
              techniques.  Second year  research will focus on more accurate measurement of
              fluxes from  additional basins and application of carbon isotopy to support the
               nature of the source of methane and NMHCs.  The proposed research  will be of
              significance in global change research if it is found  that natural
              microseepage is a major contribution to the methane  and C2-C5 emission
              inventories.
