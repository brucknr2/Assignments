Abstract    :
              The first U.S. 5-story full-scale research building which                      
              was tested at UCSD under simulated seismic loads to 1-1/2 to                   
              two times the seismic design and deformation levels,                           
              provides in its damaged state a unique opportunity to                          
              develop and experimentally validate new repair technologies.                   
              The proposed repair measures consist of epoxy injection,                       
              advanced composite wall and floor overlays as well as                          
              ceramic foam applications in the hollow core plank floors,                     
              with particular emphasis on materials and technologies                         
              originally developed and applied in the defense industry to                    
              show their potential for application in the civil sector. It                   
              is proposed to use loading sequences in the retest which                       
              correspond closely to the original seismic load test, in                       
              order to get a direct experimental seismic behavior                            
              comparison for the verification of the effectiveness of the                    
              proposed repair measures.  The test results will provide                       
              important information about the repairability of damaged                       
              reinforced masonry structures and about the expected                           
              behavior of repaired structures under future seismic loads.
