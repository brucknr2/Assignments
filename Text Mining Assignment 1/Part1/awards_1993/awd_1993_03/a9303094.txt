Abstract    :
              9303094  Lukas    A deep-water oceanographic station established at a site 100
              km  north of Oahu, Hawaii, in October 1988, will be occupied for five  more
              years.  This program is considered a component of the World  Ocean
              Time-Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and is called the Hawaii  Ocean Time-series
              (HOT).  Hydrographic cruises will be made to the  station site approximately
              seven to eight times per year, for  intensive sampling of the biochemical and
              physical properties of  the water column.  Temperature, salinity, and dissolved
              oxygen will  be measured and, discrete water samples will be obtained for 
              chemical analysis.  An inverted echo sounder (IES) will be  maintained at the
              site to give continuity to the hydrographic  stations and to resolve the high
              frequencies observed in the data  for periods lower than the cruise sampling
              interval.  In addition,  as part of this program, the analysis of the data
              collected since  1988 will be performed.  ***
