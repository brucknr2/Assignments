Abstract    :
              This modern petrologic study of epizonal contact                               
              metamorphism around the Marysville and Boulder intrusions is                   
              designed to elucidate processes associated with the movement                   
              of heat and fluid through the shallow continental crust.                       
              The study will involve examination of rock textures using                      
              state-of-art electron beam instruments and image analysis                      
              systems.  Parameters characterizing the rock textures will                     
              then be utilized in forward thermal modelling of the                           
              aureoles to constrain aspects of fluid-rock interactions                       
              during contact metamorphism.  Aspects of interest include                      
              the flux of fluid, the direction and pattern of fluid flow,                    
              and the degree to which rock textures and parageneses                          
              conform to an equilibrium model.
