Abstract    :
              9303022  Goldman    This research investigates the properties of disordered
              ultrathin  films prepared by vapor deposition onto substrates held at liquid 
              helium temperatures.  The central focus is on disorder and 
              magnetic-field-induced superconductor-insulator transitions.  The  physics
              underlying these transitions will be identified by mapping  out the phase
              diagram in the space of the magnetic field,  temperature, and disorder, bu
              determining critical exponents, and  by investigating the transport and
              magnetotransport properties of  the materials.  The structures of the films
              will be investigated in  situ via reflection high energy electron diffraction,
              and scanning  tunneling microscopy.  These studies will provide information
              about  the nucleation and growth of the films.  %%%  This research studies the
              deposition, growth and physical  properties of thin films of superconducting
              materials.   Interestingly, the films lose their superconducting properties
              when  a magnetic field is applied to them, and become isulators.  The 
              underlying physics of this dramatic change in electrical  conductivity is not
              well understood, and a number of measurements  are proposed to reveal important
              characteristics of the phenomena.   The results will be of fundamental interest
              in the science of  superconductivity.  Additionally, the workers will
              investigate the  structure and nucleation of the films, to see how the
              materials  morphology relates to the observed properties.  ***
