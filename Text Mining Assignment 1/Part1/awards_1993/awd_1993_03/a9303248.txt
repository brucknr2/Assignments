Abstract    :
                   Because recent studies in lakes and rivers indicate that                  
              trophic interactions strongly influence community structure, it                
              might be expected that such interactions would similarly influence             
              wetland communities.  However while the primary producers examined             
              in most lake and river studies were live plants, most consumable               
              primary production in wetlands is detritus.  Thus food web dynamics            
              in wetlands probably differ from those in other aquatic systems.               
              Previous wetland researchers have manipulated the bottom-up force              
              of detritus biomass but detritivore populations often don't                    
              respond; wetland detritivores may not be resource limited.  Few                
              investigations have examined how wetland detritivores are                      
              influenced by top-down forces of predation.  Experiments that                  
              examine how bottom-up interactions with detritus and top-down                  
              interactions with predators concurrently affect populations of                 
              detritivorous midges are planned.  Using enclosure/exclosure                   
              mesocosms (2 x 2 m) in a New York wetland, the following phenomena             
              will be examined: midge responses to plant litter biomass, first-              
              level predator densities (insects), and second-level predator                  
              densities (fish).  The relative influences on midges of food and               
              habitat heterogeneity from detritus will be determined.                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Wetland habitats are arguably the least understood of all aquatic              
              habitats and are the most endangered as well.  These days, policy              
              decisions regarding wetlands are being made with insufficient                  
              scientific information.  In addition to addressing theoretical                 
              questions about wetlands, this work has implications for applied               
              ecology because midges are important links between primary                     
              producers and higher level consumers (such as passerine birds and              
              waterfowl).
