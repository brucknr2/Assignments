Abstract    :
              9303967  Wyllie  This research project is concerned with the origin of the 
              intrusive and extrusive siliceous magmas characteristic of  compressive plate
              boundaries.  The processes involved in the  flux of materials, vapors and
              magmas from subducted oceanic  crust, through the overlying mantle wedge, and
              into the  continental crust will be examined by means of dehydration-  melting
              experiments.  Projects of particular interest  include the dehydration melting
              of amphibolite and biotite-  amphibole gneisses in the 10-20 kb range, phase 
              relationships and melting products from basalt-calcite at 10  kb, and
              determinination of the H2O-undersaturated liquidus  surface of monzodiorite as
              a means to address the origin of  mantle-derived LILE-enriched Archean
              monzodiorites.
