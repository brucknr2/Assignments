Abstract    :
              9303121  Lai       The investigator studies bivariate splines of smoothness 
              rand degree d with a small d vs. r to enhance the efficiency of  using
              bivariate splines to solve application problems, and uses  new or recent
              results on multivariate splines to solve some  application problems in computer
              aided geometric design,  numerical image processing, and numerical solution of
              partial  differential equations.       Multivariate splines are piecewise
              polynomial functions with  certain smoothness.  The pieces need not fit
              together as  smoothly as if they all were part of the same polynomial.  
              Roughly speaking, the higher the degree of the piecewise  polynomial relative
              to its smoothness, the more roughly the  pieces can fit together.  Because
              polynomial functions are the  easiest functions to manipulate and because
              almost all problems  in the real world are multivariable or multiparametric in
              nature,  multivariate splines are a good tool to model the target  functions. 
              Although the theory of bivariate splines with large  degree versus smoothness
              is available, bivariate splines have too  large a degree to be used in practice
              efficiently.  That is, only  bivariate splines with small degree versus
              smoothness can achieve  the efficiency and the accuracy required by computer
              aided  geometric design, numerical image processing, and numerical  solution of
              partial differential equations.  At present, those  bivariate splines can be
              constructed for a few cases.  The  project undertakes aspects of a general
              theory of such splines,  with an eye to the applications.  ***
