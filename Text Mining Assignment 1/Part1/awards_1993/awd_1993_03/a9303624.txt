Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D.                 
              from University of Arizona and his Ph.D. research was in the area              
              of environmental stress on plants.  He plans to carry out his                  
              postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. David                
              Meinke at Oklahoma State University.  The proposed research                    
              entitled "Embryo-defective T-DNA insertional mutants of                        
              Arabidopsis thaliana" will broaden the training of the Fellow                  
              into plant genetics and developmental biology.
