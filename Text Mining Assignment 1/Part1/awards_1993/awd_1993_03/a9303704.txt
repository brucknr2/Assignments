Abstract    :
                   The research entails questions concerning the properties of               
              subvarieties of projective space using the geometry of exterior                
              differential systems and partial differential equations.  These                
              methods may be instrumental in obtaining progress on some                      
              important questions and conjectures in algebraic geometry.  The                
              research also entails developing certain geometric features of                 
              certain algorithmic systems.  The overall approach to these                    
              questions are likely to have extensions to other branches of pure              
              and applied mathematics.
