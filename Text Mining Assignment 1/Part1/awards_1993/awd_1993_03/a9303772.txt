Abstract    :
              9303772  Burke       This project comprises three areas of study: (1) robust 
              methods in nonlinear programming, including development of  algorithms for
              problems involving infeasibility and lack of  regularity; (2) least-squares
              methods for nonlinear  complementarity, and development of globally defined
              algorithms  based on a least-squares methodology, and (3) eigenvalue 
              optimization and eigenvalue problems.       This research can significantly
              expand the traditional  domain of applications for nonlinear programming
              methods.  For  example, techniques for infeasible nonlinear programs can be 
              applied to guide a system through a catastrophic event; e.g., the   maintenance
              of power flow in a power grid that can no longer meet   demand due to a downed
              transmission line or a damaged switching    station.  Global strategies in
              nonlinear complementarity may  permit the solution of discrete infinite
              dimensional nonlinear  variational inequalities; e.g., the variational
              inequalities  found in liquid crystal simulation.  The research into 
              variational principles in eigenvalue optimization has wide  application in the
              optimal design of stable structures having  nonlinear dynamics.  ***
