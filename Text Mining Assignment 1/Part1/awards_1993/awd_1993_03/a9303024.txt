Abstract    :
              9303024  Hoffmann       Based on current research a Caltech, it has been
              determined  that the redox cycle of Fe in near-shore continental troposphere 
              involves both dissolved and aerosol surface species and it is  controlled
              primarily by level of oxidizable organic compounds that  co-exist with the
              various phases and species containing Fe(III).   These co-existing organic
              compounds undergo thermal and photo-  assisted oxidation by Fe(III) species
              (soluble complexes and metal  oxide polymorphs) to yield carboxylic acids. 
              This chemical  interdependency is consistent with the strong correlation
              observed  between the concentrations of Fe(II) and CH3 carbon dioxide in 
              marine stratus clouds.  In addition, irradiated ambient aerosol  particles have
              been shown to produce relatively large  concentrations of h2o2 when electron
              donors such as oxalate and  formate are present.  These results suggest that
              illuminated clouds  and haze aerosol may provide an in situ source of hydrogen
              peroxide  to air parcels in the troposphere.  This result is a major finding 
              of significance to global troposphere chemistry in regards to  sources of
              oxidizing capacity in the atmosphere.       In light of the on-going research
              (NSF Grant ATM-9015775 on  the dynamic chemistry of iron in the atmosphere, the
              following  research objectives have been established: 1) experimentally 
              determine the various chemical forms and oxidation states of Fe in  cloud-,
              fog- and rainwater collected from marine and continental  (both rural and
              urban) environments, 2) characterize the solid-  phase of Fe and Mn, which
              participate in redox cycles in  atmospheric water droplets, and trace their
              sources to the  atmosphere.
