Abstract    :
                   This award provides technical support, in the form of the                 
              partial salary costs of a technician, to operate, maintain, and                
              give instructions on the principles and operations of the electron             
              microprobe laboratory in the Department of Geological Sciences at              
              the University of Chicago. The electron microprobe is a heavily                
              used research and teaching instrument at Chicago, used primarily               
              for the quantitative microanalysis (chemical composition) of                   
              mineral and geological samples.
