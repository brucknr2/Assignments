Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Michigan (UM) requests funding for shipboard                 
              technician activities associated with the research vessel                      
              LAURENTIAN, an 80-foot vessel.  The LAURENTIAN is owned and                    
              operated by UM.  It is the only UNOLS vessel conducting NSF-funded             
              research in the Great Lakes.  In most years, the LAURENTIAN                    
              supports between 30 to 100 days of NSF-funded research.  The UM                
              technician will be responsible for operating and repairing                     
              instruments while at sea, maintaining instruments onshore and                  
              assisting with scientific operations necessary before and after                
              cruises.
