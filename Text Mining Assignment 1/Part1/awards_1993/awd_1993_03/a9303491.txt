Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will cover the study of singular                    
              spaces in Riemannian geometry.  In particular, a continued study               
              of the geometry of Alexandrov spaces relative to the Gromov-                   
              Hausdorff limit resulting from isometric group actions.                        
              Applications to structural and recognition problems via metric                 
              invariants , will be pursued.
