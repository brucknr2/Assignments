Abstract    :
                   Zierau will investigate the realization of singular unitary               
              representation associated to elliptic coadjoint orbits of a                    
              semisimple Lie group, i. e. representations on Dolbeault                       
              cohomology.  He will unitarize these representations using square              
              integrable harmonic forms and the invariant indefinite metric on               
              the orbit.                                                                     
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
