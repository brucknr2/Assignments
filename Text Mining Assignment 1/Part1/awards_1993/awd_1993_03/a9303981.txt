Abstract    :
              The research entails investigations into aspects of value  distribution theory
              in several complex variables and complex  geometry with special attention to
              classes of complex curves in  complex projective planes.  The methods and
              techniques are likely  to have ramifications to other branches of mathematics,
              in  particular, algebraic and arithmetic geometry and number theory.
