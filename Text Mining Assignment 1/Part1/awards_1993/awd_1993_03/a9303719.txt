Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Kahn to work                
              in combinatorics and graph theory.  Professor Kahn will focus in               
              on problems concerned with graphs and hypergraphs, where some                  
              parameter is tending towards infinity.  In this situation a                    
              common occurrence is that in many ways such objects are                        
              unexpectedly well-behaved.                                                     
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
