Abstract    :
              This award, made in the Special Projects Office of the                         
              Chemistry Division, will provide travel expenses for U.S.                      
              participants and subsistence for participants at the Bilateral                 
              U.S./France Workshop on Molecular Routes to Materials to be                    
              held at the University of Texas/Austin, February 21-26, 1993.                  
              This Workshop will provide a forum for the exchange of the most                
              recent information, ideas, and concepts and for the discussion                 
              of common problems in the emerging field of "molecules to                      
              materials". The workshop will also catalyze increasing                         
              collaboration between approximately fifteen U.S. and fifteen                   
              French chemists in this important research area. The format of                 
              the workshop will be stimulating and effective and will provide                
              for in-depth discussion of a broad range of materials-related                  
              topics. The location of the workshop will also permit                          
              interactions between the workshop participants and the                         
              University of Texas Science and Technology Center for the                      
              Synthesis, Growth and Analysis of Electronic Materials.

              Support of this workshop is wholly consistent with the                         
              infrastructure-building goals among international scientists                   
              and with the Advanced Materials and Processing Program.
