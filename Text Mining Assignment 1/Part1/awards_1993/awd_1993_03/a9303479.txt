Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study embeddings of                       
              Cauchy-Riemann manifolds, and their deformations.  This subject                
              has ramifications in perturbation theory and singularity theory.               
              He will also study loop spaces on Cauchy-Riemann manifolds in                  
              complex geometry.
