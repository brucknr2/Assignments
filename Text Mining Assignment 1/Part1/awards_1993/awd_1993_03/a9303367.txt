Abstract    :
              de Branges  9303367       This project continues mathematical research on
              problems in  complex analysis and the application of methods of factorization 
              of entire functions to attempt a resolution of the Riemann  Hypothesis.  This
              venerable conjecture concerns the roots of the  so-called Riemann
              zeta-function.  This an important function in  number theory which itself is
              not entire (having a pole at the  number 1).  It is believed to have roots
              along the line  perpendicular to real axis passing through 1/2.  Often
              forgotten  is the fact that this function also has roots at the negative  even
              integers.  The factorization theory employed here derives  from the spectral
              theory of self-adjoint second order  differential operators.  Hilbert himself
              conjectured that the  spectral theory contains a proof of the Riemann
              hypothesis.  This  theory in itself does not contain enough information about
              roots  along the critical line.  Work will be done in developing another 
              spectral theory for the purposes at hand.  Factorization theory  in effect
              replaces the classical Euler product representation of  the zeta-function with
              two-by-two matrices whose entries are  entire functions.  The elementary
              factors of the reciprocal of  the Euler product are recovered from the
              determinants of the  matrices.         The search for an answer to the question
              of the roots of  the Riemann zeta-function has a rich history, in which 
              fundamental mathematical ideas and structures evolved and a  gained life of
              their own.  This project, whether or not it  completes the search, will
              undoubtedly continue in this tradition  whereby the products of the research
              may prove to be more  valuable the goal itself.  ***
