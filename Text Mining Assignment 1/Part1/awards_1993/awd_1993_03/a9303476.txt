Abstract    :
                   The investigator will be studying the Riemannian geometry of              
              manifolds of strictly negative curvature.  Particular attention                
              will be paid to symmetric spaces and 2-step nilpotent Lie groups               
              with invariant metric.  Results will include estimates on                      
              curvature bounds and metric geometry.
