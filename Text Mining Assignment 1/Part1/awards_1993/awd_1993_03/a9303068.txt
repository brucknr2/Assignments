Abstract    :
                   This research will explore the decadal-scale interannual                  
              variability of the stratosphere, with the goal of increasing our               
              understanding of the effects of both internal and solar-driven                 
              interannual variability and how these signals propagate through the            
              atmosphere.                                                                    
                   Several signals or forcings have been identified which may                
              account for many of the year-to-year changes in the stratospheric              
              circulation.  These signals include the quasi-biennial oscillation             
              of the tropical stratosphere, the 11-year solar cycle, secular                 
              trends (possibly due to global climate change), El Nino/Southern               
              Oscillation and tropospheric signals, and low-frequency modulation             
              of higher-frequency signals.                                                   
                   The approach will be to use a combination of observational                
              data analysis and numerical modeling to explore the existence,                 
              causes, and propagation of decadal-scale signals in the                        
              stratosphere.  Observational work will exploit gridded atmospheric             
              data sets, rocketsonde observations, and satellite- and ground-                
              based ozone measurements.  Techniques such as correlations,                    
              composites, and empirical orthogonal functions will be used to                 
              identify interannual signals in the data.                                      
                   The effect of changes in solar output on the earth's recent               
              climate is not well known.  Likewise, decadal variations of the                
              earth-atmosphere system apart from solar influence are poorly                  
              understood.  The understanding of the interannual variability of               
              the stratosphere is important not only because of its links to the             
              troposphere, but due to possible identification of secular global              
              climate trends and the role of solar variability in determining the            
              global climate.
