Abstract    :
              9303641  Kerfeld  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research 
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from  University
              of California at Los Angeles.  Her Ph.D. research was in  the area of
              photosynthesis with a focus on membrane biochemistry.   She plans to carry out
              her postdoctoral fellowship research in the  laboratory of Dr. Todd Yeates also
              at University of California at  Los Angeles although at a different department.
               The proposed  research entitled "Crystallization and structure determination
              of  the photosynthetic pigment-proteins of Chromatium" will expand the 
              scientific experience of this Fellow into structural biology.  This  is an area
              of science not many plant biologists choose to go into,  and in need of study. 
              The proposed plan also includes extended  foreign research experience at Max
              Planck Institute in Germany.  ***
