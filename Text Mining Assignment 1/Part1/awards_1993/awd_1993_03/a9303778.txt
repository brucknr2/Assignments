Abstract    :
                   The investigation concerns the study of generalized zeta                  
              functions and the concept of analytic torsion.  Topological                    
              questions will be considered along with the dynamics of                        
              holomorphic vector fields on complex manifolds.  Applications to               
              several deep questions in mathematical physics concerning                      
              holomorphic dynamics, are envisaged.
