Abstract    :
                   The theme of this mathematical research is the investigation              
              of mechanical systems described by systems with memory effects.                
              The memory comes in either by a viscoelastic constitutive                      
              equation of the equation of the material, yielding a Volterra                  
              type partial differential-integral equation, or by coupling to                 
              another system which is solved explicitly, so that its                         
              contribution to the model comes in as a set of boundary                        
              conditions containing convolution integrals.  The main objective               
              is the approximation of the convolution kernels in a way such                  
              that the Volterra type conditions are replaced by a higher                     
              order differential equation, subject to the constraint that                    
              the approximating systems are again dissipative, to                            
              ensure convergence.  In the frequency domain this means a                      
              rational approximation of the Laplace transform of the kernel.                 
                   In addition to providing numerical tools for                              
              handling equations modeling phenomena with memory effects, this                
              work advances the theory of integrodifferential equations in                   
              two directions in which the established theory is still weak.                  
              The first is the analysis of operator valued kernels and the                   
              second is the study of phenomena where the memory enters the                   
              boundary conditions.
