Abstract    :
                   The thermal evolution of crust margins involved in                        
              collisional processes is an important issue in tectonics, as                   
              the thermal and physical modification of  the crust through                    
              thrust stacking and associated magmatism play an important                     
              role in the growth of continents.  This project will focus                     
              on the piedmont of Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania where                   
              a continental margin arc developed and subsequently collided                   
              with the margin with attendant overthickening by thrust                        
              stacking and low pressure, high temperature metamorphism.                      
              The work will develop the tectonic chronology of the                           
              collisional orogen through high precision U-Pb ages of                         
              zircons and monazite from rocks that record the                                
              overthickening event and associated magmatism.  The duration                   
              of the entire orogenic cycle from arc stage through thrust                     
              stacking to partial melting can be uniquely determined in                      
              the study area, and should provide a benchmark assessment of                   
              rates of metamorphic-igneous-tectonic processes in  a                          
              collisional environment.
