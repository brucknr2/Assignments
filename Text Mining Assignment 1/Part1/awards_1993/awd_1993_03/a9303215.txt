Abstract    :
              9303215  Schmid       The research entails an investigation into classes of 
              anomalies arising in quantum field and string theory.  The  intended
              classification of the underlying principles, employing a  variety of techniques
              drawn from global analysis and topology is  hoped to shed new light on a number
              of perplexing questions  studied in modern physics.
