Abstract    :
              Research will continue on differentiable statistical functionals  and operators.
               Let P be a probability measure.  Let P(n) be the  empirical probability
              measure which is the sum of masses 1/n at  each of n observations independent
              with distribution P.  Let T be  a nonlinear operator defined on such
              probability measures.  For  suitable T, one is looking for differentiability
              properties such  that T P(n)  = T P  + A P(n)-P  + r(n) where A is a linear 
              operator, and r(n) is a remainder of smaller order of magnitude  than |P(n)-P|
              in a suitable sense.  The project will investigate  both one-dimensional and
              multidimensional spaces on which the  measures are defined.  For sums of large
              numbers of independent, identically distributed  observations, probability
              limit theorems such as the law of large  numbers and central limit theorems
              show the asymptotic behavior.   In recent work, such facts are being extended
              to suitable non-  linear functions in place of sums.  In the current project,
              the  sample spaces of observations are being extended from one-  dimensional to
              multidimensional spaces.
