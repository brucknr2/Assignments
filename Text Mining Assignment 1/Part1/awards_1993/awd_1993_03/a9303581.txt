Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Department of Physics at the State University of New                       
              York at Stony Brook will purchase a Process Systems                            
              International model 1410 helium liquefaction system to                         
              replace (and upgrade) the 20years old deteriorated existing                    
              one.  The equipment will be used for several ongoing                           
              materials research projects, primarily work on high                            
              temperature superconductivity in cuprates and fullerence,                      
              Josephson junctions and electronics, fractional quantum Hall                   
              effect, macroscopic quantum phenomena, and single-electron                     
              tunneling.   Use of a closed cycle helium liquefaction                         
              system will significantly reduce the cost of research funded                   
              by NSF and other federal and state agencies and contribute                     
              to conservation of a limited natural resource-helium gas.
