Abstract    :
              9303924  Trimble       The principal focus of this research is the development
              of  expert systems for instructional purposes.  The investigator will  draw on
              previous work on knowledge acquisition in system dynamics  (SD), an extensive
              literature search, direct communication with  other researchers at Morris
              Brown, and participation in significant  National and International
              Conferences.  Knowledge from over 30 SD  experts has been captured through
              interviews, and a Delhi exercise.   The manipulation of this knowledge to
              develop a knowledge base for  an expert system is a key aspect of this
              research.  Open issues  regarding protocol analysis will be addressed.  This
              research will  present a case for the most effective protocol analysis
              techniques  in this situation.
