Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support                                       
              collaborative research in biochemistry between                                 
              Dr. David Jameson of the University of Hawaii                                  
              and Dr. Juan Brunet of the Catholic University                                 
              of Valparaiso, Chile.  The objective  of the                                   
              research is to characterize and quantify                                       
              dynamic aspects of Horseradish Peroxidase                                      
              (HRP), using steady-state and time-resolved                                    
              fluorescence methodologies, and investigate                                    
              their relationship to various catalytic                                        
              processes.  These spectroscopic investigations                                 
              will be important for comparison with similar                                  
              information obtained in other heme enzymes.                                    
                                                                                             
              Horseradish Peroxidase is a hemeprotein, which                                 
              catalyses the oxidation and peroxidation of a                                  
              variety of organic and inorganic compounds and                                 
              is an attractive model for protein dynamic                                     
              studies.  This work continues a successful and                                 
              productive collaboration between the two                                       
              scientists.  The proposed time-resolved                                        
              fluorescence measurements have not been                                        
              included in previous studies, thus, the results                                
              of this research will provide useful new                                       
              information about the structure and function of                                
              the HRP.
