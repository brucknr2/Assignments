Abstract    :
              Electronic upgrades will be made to a suite of shared-use ocean                
              bottom seismometers (OBS) that are used in long-term deployments on            
              the sea floor.  Scripps Institution of Oceanography maintains a                
              number of OBS instruments to record seafloor seismic activity for              
              periods of up to a month at high data rates.  The upgrade will                 
              allow the instruments to record data continuously for a six-month              
              period.  This new capability will be accomplished through the                  
              addition of a second digital audio tape recorder, rearrangement of             
              analog circuitry, and the addition of new batteries.  Once                     
              upgraded, the instruments will be capable of long-term deployments             
              required for experiments such as those proposed in the RIDGE Global            
              Change research program.
