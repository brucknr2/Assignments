Abstract    :
              9303534  Davis    This grant will cover travel expenses for US scientists to
              attend  the 'Molecular Neurobiology of Drosophila Conference' at Cold  Spring
              Harbor to be held October, 1993.  This is an important  meeting to the
              Neuroscience field in that it has over the years  catalyzed the interests of
              geneticists and molecular biologists to  investigate the Drosophila nervous
              system.  The Drosophila nervous  system has provided a powerful tool for
              neuroscience research and  has had a significant impact on our understanding of
              how all   nervous systems function. The ability to mutate the Drosophila has 
              allowed a number of genes to be identified that are important to  all species. 
              This meeting has developed and grown through  continuous NSF support to be the
              most important meeting for this  field of Neuroscience.  ***
