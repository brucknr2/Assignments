Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One technique for achieving exceptional selectivity in the                     
              membrane gas separation of small molecules such as N2, H2, O2,                 
              CH4, and CO is to tailor the pore size of the membrane so that                 
              only the desired molecules can fit through the pores.  Since                   
              molecules such as N2, H2, and CO have diameters in the range                   
              of from 3-to-6 A, it is necessary to make membranes with pore                  
              sizes, which can be adjusted to a desired value within this                    
              range.  To achieve this goal, this research suggests a unique                  
              approach to making and tailoring the pore size of microporous                  
              inorganic membranes.  The starting material for the membrane                   
              is inexpensive Vycor glass, whose pores are approximately 40 A                 
              or larger in diameter.  The pore surfaces of this glass                        
              contain silanol groups (Si-OH).  The PI Proposes reacting                      
              these groups (via a CVD process) with SiCl4 to form                            
              -Si-O-SiCl3.  This reaction coats the surface with an atomic                   
              layer, which reduces the pore diameter. The chlorinated                        
              surface can then be hydroxylated by the reaction with H2O to                   
              form Si-O-SiCl2-OH, which further reduces the pore diameter.                   
              By successive reactions one can achieve atomic layer control                   
              of the pore size.  Microporous membranes with particular pore                  
              sizes will be made, and will be tested for their selectivity                   
              in various binary separations.
