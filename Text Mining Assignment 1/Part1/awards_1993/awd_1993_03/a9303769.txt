Abstract    :
                   Bunimovich will study mechanisms of space-time chaos and                  
              elucidate some convenient and widely used but vague notions of                 
              coherent structures, patterns and intermittency.  To do this, he               
              will study the behavior of some classes of coupled map lattices                
              that demonstrate most purely these types of motion.  He will                   
              consider also the related problem of transport in extended                     
              systems by investigating the thermodynamic limit of the first                  
              examples of systems of arbitrary number of interacting particles               
              recently proven to be ergodic.                                                 
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way, ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
