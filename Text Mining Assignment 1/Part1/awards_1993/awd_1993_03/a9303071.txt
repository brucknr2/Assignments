Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will define several ecological endpoints            
              that reflect the past and present status of Atlantic white cedar               
              wetlands in the Pinelands.  Temporal and geographic trends in the              
              extent, size, and quality of Atlantic white cedar swamps and their             
              spatial relationship to other landscape components will be                     
              described, and the factors responsible for any observed changes                
              will be identified.                                                            
              A model for human interactions with Atlantic white cedar swamps                
              that incorporates both a Markovian succesional model and social and            
              economic factors will be developed within the context of a                     
              geographic information system.  Using this paradigm, several                   
              scenarios reflecting different institutional policies(e.g., public             
              lands management, regulation) and transition probabilities will be             
              developed, and the effect of each institutional scenario on the                
              ecological sustainability of Atlantic white cedar swamps will be               
              assessed.  The results will have direct application to natural                 
              resource management and environmental policy decision making in the            
              region.
