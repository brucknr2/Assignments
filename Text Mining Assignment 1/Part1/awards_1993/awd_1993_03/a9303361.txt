Abstract    :
                   Dadarlat will investigate a nonstable theory of asymptotic                
              homomorphisms of C*-algebras, a homotopy classification of *-                  
              homomorphisms of subhomogeneous C*-algebras, and a perturbation                
              theory of homomorphisms into real rank zero C*-algebras.  This will            
              provide connections between the geometrical properties of C*-                  
              algebras and their algebraic invariants, and will lay the                      
              foundation for a classification theory of nuclear simple separable             
              C*-algebras.                                                                   
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
