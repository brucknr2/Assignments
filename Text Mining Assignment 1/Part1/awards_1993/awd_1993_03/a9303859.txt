Abstract    :
              This research project will test the hypothesis that there                      
              was regional-scale (thousands of square kilometers) fluid                      
              flow in east Vermont during the Acadian regional                               
              metamorphism.  The project will involve collection of stable                   
              isotopes (carbon, oxygen, hydrogen) on minerals in the Waits                   
              River Formation.  The research will focus on determining the                   
              presence, magnitude, and timing of proposed "giant"                            
              hydrothermal systems associated with major antiformal                          
              structures.  If documented, these systems will have                            
              important implications with regard to heat and mass transfer                   
              processes in the deep continental crust.
