Abstract    :
                   The investigator proposes to work on several problems in the              
              area of dynamical systems involving the existence of attractors                
              carrying Sinai-Bowen-Ruelle measures.  Investigations of ergodic               
              properties of these measures are proposed along with the                       
              generalization to multi-dimensional attractors with unstable                   
              manifolds.  Applications to a variety of physical models and                   
              several computer experiments are also intended.
