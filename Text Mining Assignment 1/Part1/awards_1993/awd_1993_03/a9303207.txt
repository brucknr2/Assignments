Abstract    :
              Thin film passive waveguide are key elements of                                
              integrated optical circuits.  If the benefits of                               
              optical fiber communication are to widely                                      
              available, thin film waveguides must be                                        
              manufactured rapidly, reliably and cheaply.  This                              
              cannot be done now.  In Phase I we used our                                    
              proprietary, environmentally sound Jet Vapor                                   
              Deposition (JVD) process to make an unusual                                    
              starting material: a ceramic host film doped with                              
              an  organic dye guest; this was then photo-                                    
              patterned, producing a working thin film                                       
              waveguide.  JVD followed by photo-patterning                                   
              has the potential for high throughput,                                         
              inexpensive production.  JVD ceramic-organic                                   
              host-guest films, produced at high rate, in                                    
              unlimited variety, and at room temperature, have                               
              excellent optical, chemical and mechanical                                     
              properties for integrated optics.  Accordingly, the                            
              JVD + photo-patterning strategy can i) provide a                               
              new class of materials useful for integrated optics                            
              and compatible with electronic ICs and ii) open                                
              the way to high volume manufacture of                                          
              integrated optic circuits.  In Phase II we will                                
              investigate the optical properties of JVD dye-                                 
              doped ceramic films, fabricate devices from them,                              
              e.g., directional couplers and filters, demonstrate                            
              JVD linking of an optical fiber to a thin film                                 
              waveguide, and implement laser photo-patterning                                
              .  Our Phase II research will provide both                                     
              fundamental advances in photonic materials and                                 
              new approaches to integrated optics                                            
              manufacturing.
