Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from            
              University of Oklahoma.  Her Ph.D. research was in the area of                 
              systematics.  She plans to carry out her postdoctoral fellowship               
              research in the laboratory of Dr. Claude W. dePamphilis at                     
              Vanderbilt University.  Dr. dePamphilis was a former recipient of              
              the NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The                
              proposed research entitled "Plastid gene evolution along                       
              hemi/heloparasitic continuum" will expand the scientific experience            
              of this Fellow into molecular evolution and will explore the                   
              process of plant adaptation.
