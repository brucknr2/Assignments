Abstract    :
              This work focusses on the growth and processing of aluminum                    
              nitride (AlN), a technologically important III-V compound, by                  
              metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  The adsorption,               
              decomposition, and thermal stability of a series of                            
              alkylaluminum and alkylsilylaluminum compounds are investigated                
              on selected substrates.  The derivatized substrates are                        
              subsequently reacted with a nitridant gas (ammonia or hydrazine)               
              to promote precursor formation; the precurser is then reacted                  
              further to form two-dimensional oligomers of AlN.  Energetics                  
              and intermediates at each stage of the deposition process are                  
              probed with both high-pressure and ultrahigh-vacuum surface                    
              analysis techniques.  Objectives include the requirements for                  
              ordered growth at low substrates temperature, use of modified                  
              substrates as templates for site-selective adsorption, more                    
              facile nitridant gases, and the advantages of using alkylsilyl                 
              leaving groups in MOCVD.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Aluminum nitride (AlN) possess a wide Fermic band gap, high                    
              thermal conductivity, high refractivity, chemical inertness, and               
              a good thermal match to silicon; these properties make it an                   
              ideal material for electronic packaging.  It also has                          
              application in passivation layers, dielectric layers,                          
              piezoelectric films, and nonelectronic applications.  This study               
              of improved deposition technology for AlN could also have                      
              applicability to other materials desired in thin-film form.//
