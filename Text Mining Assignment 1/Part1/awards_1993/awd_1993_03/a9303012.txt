Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under partial funding from NSF, a workshop is to be held on                    
              the topic of small scale fluid-sediment interactions governing                 
              coastal sand transport.  The conference will be in Florida, on                 
              March 10-14, 1993, and its title is: "Fluid-Grain Interactions                 
              in Coastal Sand Transport".  This specialty conference is                      
              modeled on a prior one on Geophysical Grain Flows in July of                   
              1989, and aims to bring together an appropriate mix of                         
              interdisciplinary investigators.                                               
                                                                                             
              Coastal sand transport governs coastal erosion during storms,                  
              it is of great concern economically, and remedial measures are                 
              still based largely on empiricism rather than fundamental                      
              understanding.  The conference is aimed at improving this                      
              situation.
