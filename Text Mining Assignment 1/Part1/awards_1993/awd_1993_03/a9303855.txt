Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project explores the properties of matter at low temperatures.            
              Advantage is taken of the well-established properties of He-4 at               
              low temperatures to illuminate a number of problems in condensed               
              maatter physics.  One sub-project addresses the influence of                   
              controlled defects on the critical phenomena of a pure system.  The            
              introduction of a low density structural impurity into liquid                  
              helium can produce a striking alteration in the critical pehnomena.            
              An understanding of this problem will enhance our understanding of             
              the role of defects for a wider range of phase transitions.  A                 
              second area is the study of boson localization in He-4 films                   
              adsorbed on a heterogeneous substrate.  The study of the physics of            
              a boson system, such a a helium film in the random potential of                
              aheterogeneous substrate, offers an interesting complement to                  
              studies of the metal-insulator transition and the superconductor-              
              insulator transition in dirty superconductors.  A third topic will             
              be the study of a dissipative flow of superfluid helium through a              
              porous medium.  This is a boson analog to the technologically                  
              important problem of the vortex liquid and flux-flow regimes of                
              high Tc superconductors.

              This project explores the properties of matter at very low                     
              temperatures--below minus 450 degrees Fahrenheit.  The project                 
              deals with a superfluid, helium, which exhibits behavior which, by             
              analogy, can be related to phenomena in other materials,                       
              particularly high Tc superconductors.  In addition, the research               
              deals with phase transitions and provides fundamental information              
              bearing on solid-liquid melting (and other transformations) that               
              occurs in all materials.
