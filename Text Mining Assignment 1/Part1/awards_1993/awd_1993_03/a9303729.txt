Abstract    :
              9303729  Freyermuth  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research 
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from  Duke
              University and her Ph.D. research was in the area of microbial  biochemistry. 
              She also has research experience in cell wall  metabolism in Arabidopsis.  She
              plans to carry out her postdoctoral  fellowship research in the laboratory of
              Dr. Joseph Polacco at  University of Missouri.  The proposed research entitled 
              "Interactions between soybean and a bacterial commensal urease and  nitrogen
              metabolism" will expand the scientific experience of this  Fellow into
              plant-microbe interactions and nitrogen metabolism.  ***
