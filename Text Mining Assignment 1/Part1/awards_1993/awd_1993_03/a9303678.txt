Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Coupled temporal changes in water chemistry and biological                     
              community structure at newly-formed hydrothermal vents on the EPR              
              crest                                                                          
                                                                                             
              This is a study of the coupled evolution of fluid chemistry and                
              biological community structure on a fine scale (9 degree 49.6' - 9             
              degree 50.6'N) with the abundant diffuse flow which supports                   
              complex animal communities as the principal focus.  The work is                
              coupled with a funded biology program on the East Pacific Rise                 
              between 9-10 N to study the coevolution of the chemistry and                   
              biological communities in newly formed hydrothermal systems.  The              
              Alvin program in April 1991 documented to within days the occurence            
              of a seafloor volcanic eruption.  In 1992 Alvin dives to this site             
              documented significant changes in both the chemistry of the vents              
              and the biological communities surrounding them.  As this is the               
              only portion of the mid-ocean ridge system  defining "time zero"               
              for an eruptive event and the formation of a new hydrothermal                  
              system, this site offers an unprecedented opportunity to follow                
              temporal changes in vent chemistry and associated biological                   
              community structure.
