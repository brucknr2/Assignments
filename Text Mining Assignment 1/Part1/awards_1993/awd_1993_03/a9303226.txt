Abstract    :
                   New areas in the theory of integrable systems: 1)Exact                    
              time-discretizations of lattice integrable systems and related                 
              infinitely-precisenumerical schemes; 2)q-analogs of discrete                   
              integrable systems; 3)Perturbations of classical mechanics                     
              originating in Quantum Groups; 4)Relativistic analogs of                       
              integrable systems; 5)Geometric perturbations of                               
              infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian and integrable systems                        
                   The proposal seeks to develop solutions to the following                  
              open problems: 1)Construction of error-free numerical                          
              approximations to fundamental continuous systems; 2)Quantisations              
              of these, and first-order influence of these quantum effects on                
              classical systems; 3)Relativistic versions of classically                      
              important nonrelativistic systems; 4)Invariant analysis (i.e.                  
              independent of any particular point of view) of dynamical                      
              systems.
