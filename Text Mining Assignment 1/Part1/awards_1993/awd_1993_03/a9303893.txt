Abstract    :
                This research is to use regional broadband data to study Pn and              
              Sn propagation in North America, initially concentrating on the                
              western United States.  The regional phases Pn and Sn are sensitive            
              to structure in the uppermost mantle, providing information that               
              is difficult to obtain from other seismic phases on the degree and             
              nature of heterogeneity and anisotropy in the subcrustal                       
              lithosphere.  The work will investigate the questions of frequency-            
              dependent travel times and azimuthal anisotropy, both of which                 
              address the larger question of the small-scale structure of the                
              continental upper mantle.  This funding is under the NSF Research              
              Planning Grant program for women.
