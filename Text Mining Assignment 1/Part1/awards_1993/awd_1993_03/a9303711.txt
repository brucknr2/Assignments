Abstract    :
                   The research entails studying the geometry and analysis of                
              geodesic flows on classes of Riemannian manifolds relative to                  
              their topological structure.  Curvature properties of classes of               
              hyperbolic manifolds will also be investigated.  Such research                 
              may have applications to dynamical systems and mathematical                    
              physics.
