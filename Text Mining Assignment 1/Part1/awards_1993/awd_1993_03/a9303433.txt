Abstract    :
              9303433  DeFanti       This award is for the establishment of a laboratory for 
              research on the design, implementation, dissemination, and use of  highly
              interactive computing technologies for the benefit of  computational,
              biomedical and engineering sciences.  The  application areas share the need for
              very high-speed data capture  and presentation facilities, very high bandwidth
              communication, and  very large information stores.  The research topics to be
              explored  by this laboratory include the design and implementation of virtual 
              reality environments; the storage, retrieval, and navigation of  very large
              information stores; the design and evaluation of user-  centered
              domain-specific, multi-media applications; and the remote,  shared access to
              specialized instrumentation resources.  The  researchers come from the Computer
              Science Department, the School  of Art and Design, the Department of Electrical
              Engineering, the  Department of Bioengineering, and the Laboratory for
              Biomedical  visualization.  Extensive collaborations are in place with the 
              National Laboratories.  The award provides for the acquisition of 
              instrumentation to match this research.    The laboratory will consist of the
              CAVE Virtual Reality Theater, a  Database Computing Facility, an Interactive
              Multimedia laboratory,  and a Networked Remote User Facility.  The
              instrumentation provided  consists of high performance visualization computers,
              mass storage  devices, and high speed communications equipment.
