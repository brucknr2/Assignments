Abstract    :
                   This project aims study certain hyperbolic-parabolic type                 
              partial differential equations that arise form mathematical                    
              physics.  To be considered are: the asymptotic behavior of                     
              viscous flows toward general Riemann solutions which consist of                
              both compressive and expansive waves; metastability of contact                 
              discontinuities for compressible Navier-Stokes equations and in                
              MHD; L_1-nonlinear stability of viscous shock profiles for                     
              systems of viscous conservation laws; the effects of small                     
              dissipation on the interactions of  elementary waves; theory of                
              viscous shock waves for nonstrictly hyperbolic systems (this is                
              of particular significance due to the appearance of so-called                  
              transitional waves such as overcompressive and crossing shocks;                
              it seems that the admissibility of such waves should involve                   
              nonlinear stability analysis); nonlinear stability of planar                   
              viscous shocks for systems of conservation law in several space                
              dimensions; and the theory of viscous boundary layer for                       
              compressible fluids, in particular, the interaction of shock                   
              layer and boundary layers, and the continuous dependence on                    
              initial data of weak entropy solutions for systems of                          
              conservation laws.                                                             
                   Many interesting phenomena arising in physics and other                   
              branches of natural sciences can be modeled by nonlinear partial               
              differential equations of hyperbolic-parabolic type. Important                 
              examples include the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations  for                    
              compressible inviscid and viscous fluids, the equations of                     
              electro-magneto field dynamics for electrically conducting                     
              compressible viscous fluids, the equations of elasticity,                      
              nonlinear Boltzmann type equations in kinetic theory, and                      
              equations for combustion, multiphase flows, and fluids with                    
              chemical reactions.
