Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of boronic esters in                     
              asymmetric synthesis. New chemistry which should be useful for                 
              convergent syntheses will be studied, including a new type of                  
              allylic group transfer from one boron atom to another, and                     
              connection of halo boronic esters to carboxylic ester enolates.                
              Both of these yield a new chiral center at the connection                      
              point, potentially with high stereoselectivity. Cyclization of                 
              halo boronic esters will be used for making four- and                          
              five-membered rings with chirality control. Intramolecular                     
              Diels-Alder reactions using vinyl boron intermediates will be                  
              investigated. A mild method of generating alkoxyborohydrides,                  
              discovered in the Principal Investigator's laboratory, will be                 
              utilized as a route to new and inexpensive asymmetric reducing                 
              agents.

              With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Donald S. Matteson of the                       
              Department of Chemistry at Washington State University.                        
              Professor Matteson will focus his work on the use of boronic                   
              esters in asymmetric synthesis as a general method for the                     
              production of chiral molecules.
