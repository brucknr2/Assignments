Abstract    :
                   The Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science requests                 
              support from NSF for connection of its campus network to PREPnet.              
              PREPnet is the midlevel network located in the state of                        
              Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide operations management and                  
              information services and it will give the college connectivity to              
              the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                    
              National Backbone network.                                                     
                   The college needs greater functionality and network speed to              
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
