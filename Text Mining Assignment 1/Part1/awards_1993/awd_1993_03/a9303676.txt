Abstract    :
              This ongoing research project will focus on experiments to                     
              determine the mineral/melt partition coefficients for a                        
              variety of lithophile, siderophile, and platinum group                         
              elements.  The lithophile and siderophile experiments will                     
              be carried out in multianvil apparatus, will involve                           
              perovskite and magnesiowustite, and the results will                           
              ultimately have application in elucidating the early history                   
              of the  Earth.  The experiments on the platinum group                          
              elements will be carried out in gas mixing furnaces, will                      
              include studies of sulfide, spinel, and various Ti-bearing                     
              accessory minerals, and will extend our understanding of                       
              noble metals and economically exploitable mineral deposits.
