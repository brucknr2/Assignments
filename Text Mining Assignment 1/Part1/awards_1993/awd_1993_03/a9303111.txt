Abstract    :
                   Atmospheric frontal zones, the transition zone between                    
              relatively warm and cold air masses, are highly turbulent.  In the             
              this zone, kinetic energy is dissipated and internal waves are                 
              generated which may result in severe convective activity or                    
              turbulence far from the front.  Both of these processes have                   
              implications for atmospheric predictability.                                   
                   The principal investigator will employ two approaches in the              
              study of frontal zones.  He will analyze observations taken during             
              a recent field program designed to investigate frontal processes               
              known as STORM-FEST, and will use wavelet decomposition as his                 
              principal analysis tool.  He will also conduct a number of modeling            
              experiments with the goal of isolating the physical processes                  
              important for frontal evolution.                                               
                   Many of the important physical processes that govern the                  
              behavior of weather systems occur on scales which are not                      
              explicitly resolved in numerical prediction models.  The ultimate              
              goal of this study is to provide information which will allow the              
              development of representations of such and, thereby, improve                   
              numerical weather forecasts.
