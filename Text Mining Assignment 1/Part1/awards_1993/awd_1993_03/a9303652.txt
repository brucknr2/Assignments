Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from            
              University of California at Riverside.  Her Ph.D. research was in              
              molecular plant pathology of Pseudomonad.  She plans to carry out              
              her postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr.                  
              Thomas Wolpert at Oregon State University.  The proposed research              
              entitled "Immunological/biochemical characterization of victorin               
              binding in oats" will broaden the training of the Fellow into                  
              biochemistry and mycology.
