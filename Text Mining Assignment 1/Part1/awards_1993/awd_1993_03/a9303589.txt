Abstract    :
              Observed electron density distributions for the silica                         
              polymorphs coesite and stishovite will be analyzed in terms                    
              of their topographical features.  Critical points and bond                     
              paths for these distributions will be located by calculating                   
              gradient vector maps and  regions of bonded and nonbonded                      
              densities will be located by calculating  Laplacian relief                     
              maps.  An analysis of the maps will pinpoint regions that                      
              are susceptible to electrophilic and nucleophilic attack,                      
              information that is important to understanding mechanisms of                   
              surface reactions, transition states and catalytic reactions                   
              in zeolites.  The method will also be examined as a tool for                   
              monitoring phase transformations.  It is anticipated that                      
              the calculations will generate new zeolite structure types,                    
              materials of considerable interest in the petrochemical                        
              industry as solid state acids and catalysts for producing                      
              high-grade gasoline from coal  gases and molecular sieves                      
              for beneficiating petroleum products and for serving as                        
              environmental filters.
