Abstract    :
              9303842  Shimomura  Bioluminescence is a phenomenon of chemiluminescence that
              occurs in  the body or secretion of wide varieties of organisms.  The energy 
              required for light emission is supplied by the oxidation of a  luciferin
              catalyzed by a specific luciferase, or through a reaction  involving a
              photoprotein.  The light-emitting reactions of  different types of organisms
              are often significantly different,  thus there are a number of different
              luminescence systems.  The  ultimate goal of this project is the complete
              biochemical  understanding of bioluminescence and its roles.  To achieve this 
              goal, it is essential to identify the necessary key components and  determine
              their chemical structures in various different types of  bioluminescence system
              and also to elucidate the mechanism of the  light-emitting reactions.  The
              knowledge on bioluminescence  presently available includes the chemical
              structures of 8 different  luciferins and significant information on 19
              different  bioluminescence systems, of which the P.I. contributed to 5 of the 
              luciferins and 12 of the bioluminescence systems, including the  system of the
              photoprotein aequorin.  Studies will be carried out  on bioluminescence in
              fungi and euphausiid shrimp (krill).  The  mechanism of oxygenation in
              bioluminescence reactions will also be  studied.  %%%  The long-range objective
              of this research is the complete  biochemical understanding of bioluminescence,
              which encompasses the  fundamental reaction mechanism of light emission and the
              roles of  bioluminescence reactions in living organisms.  In this research,  it
              is of primary importance to determine the chemical nature of the  key
              substances and to elucidate the mechanism of the reactions  involved, in
              various different bioluminescence systems that occur  in diverse types of
              organisms.  ***
