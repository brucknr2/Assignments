Abstract    :
              Time-resolved structure determinations are at the forefront                    
              of attempts to understand the mechanisms of protein                            
              reactions.  X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides a                     
              window on the environment of specific atoms in chemical and                    
              biological  systems, and is well suited to examining the                       
              chemistry of metal atoms in biological milieu.  In addition,                   
              XAS can be applied to a wide range of sample phases, and can                   
              successfully probe the chemical environment of a wide range                    
              of atoms in the periodic table (from low Z atoms, like                         
              sulfur, to heavy atoms, like third row transition metals).                     
              We are developing a system for collecting high quality x-ray                   
              absorption spectroscopy data on s and longer timescales.                       
              The method can be used for both full spectra accumulation                      
              and kinetic spectrophotometry.  Experiments using this                         
              technology have vast potential, not only for examining                         
              metalloproteins, but also for observing the  dynamic                           
              behavior of a wide range of chemical elements in conjunciton                   
              with photo-chemical, rapid mixing, and temperature jump                        
              techniques.  We have tested the system  by examining the                       
              structural evolution of the myoglobin-carbon monoxide                          
              complex after photolysis at low temperature.
