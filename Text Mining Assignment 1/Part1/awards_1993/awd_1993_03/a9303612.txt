Abstract    :
              9303612  Springer  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research 
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D.  from Purdue
              University and her Ph.D. research was in the area of  corn genetics.  She plans
              to carry out her postdoctoral  fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr.
              R.A. Martienssen at  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  The proposed research
              entitled  "Study of leaf development using enhancer and gene traps in 
              Arabidopsis" will expand the scientific experience of this Fellow  into
              molecular biology and developmental biology.  As part of the  research training
              plan, she plans a 6-month visit to John Innes  Institute in the United Kingdom.
