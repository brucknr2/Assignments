Abstract    :
              9303208  Wand    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project
              deals with the design, synthesis, formulation and evaluation of new
              ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC) which are low in both viscosity and
              birefringence.  These materials will be used in high speed, multistate
              electro-optic and flat panel display device applications.. The specific
              approach will be to synthesize new materials with high degrees of fluorination
              or dioxaborinane cores which will be low in both viscosity and birefringence. 
              The long range objectives of the research are to increase understanding of the
              correlation of molecular structure with physical properties of new FLC phases.
