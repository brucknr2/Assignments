Abstract    :
              The investigators will continue their research involving measures of various 
              kinds-Hausdorff, packing, Gibbs state, etc.; associated functions; and
              associated  dimensions.  These notions will be studied within the context of
              various  dynamical systems as applied to Julia sets for example or to
              characterization of  Jordan curves as repellers.  They will use these
              techniques with regard to  certain geometric objects and constructions, e.g.
              self-affine sets and self--  similar objects.  This project involves research
              in ergodic theory.  Ergodic theory in general  concerns understanding the
              average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too  complicated or chaotic to be
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading  "dynamics" can be placed
              the modern theory of how groups of abstract  transformations act on smooth
              spaces.  In this way, ergodic theory makes contact  with geometry in its quest
              to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
