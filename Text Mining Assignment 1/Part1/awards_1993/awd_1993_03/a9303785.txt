Abstract    :
              9303785  Nielsen       This award provides 28 percent of the funding necessary
              to  upgrade the controlling computer system on the electron microprobe  in the
              College of Oceanography at Oregon State University. The  institution is
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed.       The electron
              microprobe laboratory at Oregon State University  provides analytical
              capabilities (quantitative elemental micro-  analyses with a spatial resolution
              of a micrometer) that is  required for the research of a large number of
              faculty and students  in the College of Oceanography and in the Department of
              Geosciences  at Oregon State.  ***
