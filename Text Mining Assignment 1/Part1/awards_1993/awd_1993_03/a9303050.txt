Abstract    :
              The investigator intends to continue his research in various  areas of
              probability theory that are closely related to his  previous work.  In
              particular, he is planning to study certain  characterization problems in
              multivariate exchangeability theory,  where the representations may be
              expressed as sums of multiple  Wiener-Ito integrals on tensor products of
              suitable Hilbert  spaces.  He will further extend his earlier study of
              exchangeable  random sets, their Palm measures and local properties.  In both 
              of these general areas, there are many related problems of a more  foundational
              nature that will also be addressed.  The investigator will continue his
              research on certain basic  structural problems in probability theory.  This
              research will  provide the general conceptual framework and basic theory 
              necessary for work of other researchers in more applied fields,  such as
              statistics and statistical mechanics, which in turn are  useful for technology
              and other areas of science.
