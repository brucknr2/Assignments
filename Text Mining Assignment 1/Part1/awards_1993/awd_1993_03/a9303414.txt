              to study the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations describing the motion of
              a collisionless plasma (or stellar dynamics). He is interested in cases when
              the initial state of the plasma is very irregular; i.e., the densities of
              electrons and ions are finite measures. Thus, a major difficulty is to find the
              right weak formulation in which one can prove that there exists one and
              possibly the unique weak solution. When the concept of measure-valued solutions
              is used, he will carefully look for evidence to show that it is inevitable. If
              weak solutions are not unique or stable, he will look for appropriate entropy
              criteria and stability conditions or the underlying mechanism of instability.
              The methods to be used include the $BV$ calculus of Vol'pert, the
              concentration-cancellation method of DiPerna-Majda, and potential theory of
              Calder\'on-Zygmund type. Explicit exact solutions are possible and he will
              construct and use them extensively. He will also investigate weak convergence
              of numerical schemes for weak solutions.          Yuxi Zheng proposes to study 
              the motion of a collisionless plasma. He is interested in cases when the
              initial state of the plasma is very irregular. This problem resembles
              mathematically the motion for an incompressible fluid flow with singular
              initial data.  Both problems are of physical significance and provide
              mathematical challenge. Physical examples in clude irregular motions in galaxy
              formation, controlled nuclear reactors, and water or air wakes of fast moving
              bodies. Understanding of these  irregular motions will help the entire front of
              nonlinear phenomena and undoubtedly improve the current technologies in these
              areas. ***
