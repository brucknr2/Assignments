Abstract    :
                  9303138  Saadatmenesh  The conference will be attended by people from
              various countries  and will include presentation and discussions of current and
              future  research as well as ways of integrating advanced composites, which 
              were primarily developed in the aerospace industry, into the  construction
              industry.  Every effort will be made to create an  atmosphere for effective
              communication among participants from  aerospace industry, construction
              industry, researchers, and  regulatory agencies to pave the way for the
              transfer of technology  from the composite and aerospace industries into the
              construction  industry.
