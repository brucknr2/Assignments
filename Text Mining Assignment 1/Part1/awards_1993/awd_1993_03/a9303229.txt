Abstract    :
              9303229  Gordon       Professor Gordon will investigate various questions about 
              the Dehn surgery construction of 3-manifolds from knots and  links.  In the
              generic case, the knot or link complement will  have a hyperbolic structure,
              which persists under most surgeries.   This persistence fails if (and only if,
              modulo the Geometrization  Conjecture) the resulting 3-manifold contains an
              essential sphere  or torus, or is Seifert fibred.  This project is to continue
              a  joint program with Professor John Luecke of understanding and 
              circumscribing these exceptional surgeries via the combinatorial  analysis of
              intersections of surfaces.  Results obtained so far  include the Knot
              Complement Conjecture, the Reducibility  Conjecture, and strong restrictions on
              the creation of essential  tori.  Specific foci of the project will include the
              Cabling  Conjecture and the question of when Seifert fibred spaces (both 
              toroidal and atoroidal) arise.       The general context of the project is the
              attempt to further  our understanding of 3-manifolds.  A 3-manifold is a
              "space"  which is locally like ordinary 3-dimensional Euclidean space, but 
              whose global topological structure may be quite complicated.  For  example, our
              universe is a 3-manifold, whose global structure is  at present unknown.  The
              problem of describing all 3-manifolds in  a reasonable way is an important one
              that is still unsolved,  although much progress has been made.  The subject is
              a rich one,  which draws on a wide range of mathematical techniques, including 
              some derived from quantum physics.  The main focus of the project  is Dehn
              surgery, which is a procedure for constructing  3-manifolds from a knot (i.e. a
              closed loop embedded somehow in  3-dimensional Euclidean space) or, more
              generally, a link (i.e.  several knots linked together).  Roughly speaking, the
              knot or  link is removed and "sewn back" differently.  Since it turns out  that
              all 3-manifolds can be constructed in this way, a  sufficiently good
              understanding of Dehn surgery wou ld have  important implications for the
              general theory of 3-manifolds.  ***
