Abstract    :
                   This project will examine the solar diameter at different                 
              orientations.  A series of past balloon flights of the SDS have                
              demonstrated its ability to measure solar diameters with a                     
              precision (rms residuals) at a given orientation of 14 milli arc s             
              for individual measurements.  In the present configuration we make             
              approximately 5 measurements per second.  Design features of the               
              latest version of the instrument insure that this same precision               
              will be retained at different orientations, and from year to year.             
                   The primary objective of these flights is to obtain the                   
              relationship between diameter and luminosity changes.  When                    
              combined with historical diameter data, the relationship will allow            
              the determination of the magnitude (or, at least, upper limits) of             
              the solar luminosity changes for nearly the past three centuries.              
              This information will be provided to climate modelers in order to              
              elucidate the effect of solar variability on climate change.  A                
              secondary objective of this project is to obtain a high precision              
              value of the solar oblateness for each flight, and thus test                   
              whether it changes with time as recently suggested by other                    
              researchers.                                                                   
                   The five year term of the proposal has two purposes.  First,              
              these flights, when combined with the flight recently carried out,             
              will cover over half of a solar activity cycle, and thus provide a             
              meaningful test for variability.  Second, according to current                 
              plans, the EUDOSSO experiment (a derivative of the SDS) should fly             
              on the ESA mission EURECA 3 in 1997.  The present results will                 
              provide an invaluable data base for EUDOSSO, and one flight overlap            
              will allow an intercalibration of the results.
