Abstract    :
              9303029  Deng       Light signals from the environment are perceived by specific
               regulatory photoreceptors in plants and transduced by unknown  mechanisms to
              control growth and development.  The long term goal  of this research is to
              dissect the molecular mechanisms by which  such signals are transduced and
              integrated to modulate plant  development.  The light-regulated seedling
              development of  Arabidopsis thaliana has been used as a model experimental
              system  in my laboratory.  Nine COP (constitutive photomorphogenic) loci, 
              which when mutated produce dark-grown seedlings with a morphology  resembling
              that of light-grown wild-type seedlings, have been  identified.  The
              Arabidopsis COP1 (constitutive photomorphogenic)  locus, which plays a central
              role in the light signaling process  and encodes a novel protein with putative
              DNA-binding and G-protein  homology domains, represents the only light
              signaling component  besides phytochrome that has been characterized in a
              molecular  term.  The preliminary studies in my laboratory indicate that the 
              cop9 mutation results in the same range of phenotype as the cop1  mutants. 
              Therefore COP9 and COP1 may encode closely related  regulatory components in
              the same signaling pathway.  It is  proposed here to clone and sequence the
              COP9 locus, by using an  available T-DNA insertional mutant allele.  After
              determining the  molecular identity of the COP9 gene, appropriate probes (DNA
              and  antibodies) will be developed for the molecular analysis and COP9 
              promoter-GUS transgenic plants will be generated for analyzing  expression
              pattern of the COP9 gene.  With these tools available,  it will enable us to
              determine at the molecular level 1) how the  wild-type COP9 gene product
              couples light signals and seedling  development, and 2) the relationship
              between the COP1 and COP9  genes.  Furthermore, the regulatory hierarchy of
              COP9 and other  identified photomorphogenic loci during light-regulated
              seedling  development will be analyzed.  %%%  Accomplishment of these  studies
              will not only ascertain the nature  of a critical regulatory component that
              links light signals to  seedling development, but also provide clues as to how
              the COP9  relates to other photomorphogenic genes.  ***
