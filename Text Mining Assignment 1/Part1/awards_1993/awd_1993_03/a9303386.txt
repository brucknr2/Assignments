Abstract    :
                   Rieffel will continue his investigation of C*-algebraic                   
              quantization.  Topics to be studied include quantization and                   
              quantum groups, aspects of quantum topology and differential                   
              geometry, and harmonic analysis on Lie groups.  Attention will also            
              be given to relationships with applications in such areas as                   
              quantum mechanics and field theory, and signal processing and                  
              pattern recognition.                                                           
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
