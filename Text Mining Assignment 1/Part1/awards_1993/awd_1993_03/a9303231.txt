Abstract    :
                   Sheu will continue his research on the interaction between C*-            
              algebras and geometry, with emphasis on the C*-algebraic                       
              deformation quantization.  The motivation of this research is the              
              recent worldwide interest in the promising new theory of quantum               
              groups which links together several branches of mathematics and is             
              closely related to mathematical physics.  The objective of this                
              research is to advance the understanding of this relatively new                
              area of mathematics.  The main tools to be used in this research               
              will be from various mathematical branches including C*-algebras,              
              Lie groups, differential geometry, and pseudodifferential                      
              operators.                                                                     
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
