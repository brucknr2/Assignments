Abstract    :
              9303661  Goss  The goal of this project is understanding the mechanism of 
              eucaryotic protein synthesis.  In particular a detailed study is  planned of
              equilibrium and kinetic parameters characterizing the  interactions of
              eucaryotic initiation factors with mRNA and  oligonucleotides.  Specific aims
              include: (1) study of initiation  factor interactions with 5'-cap structures on
              mRNA, (2) study of  the interaction of eIf-4B with mRNA, (3) explore
              interactions of  various initiation factors together and separately with 
              oligonucleotides (including ATP effects), and (4) investigate the  kinetics of
              initiation factor interactions with oligonucleotides  and mRNA.  %%%  Protein
              synthesis from many points of view begins with initiation,  a process involving
              numerous protein factors and specific portions  of mRNA.  This is a contentious
              area of research because the system  is so sensitive to experimental parameters
              and the choice of  simplifications (ie. which components to employ).  The
              studies  planned are important because they will actually quantitate the 
              interactions involved.  This will ultimately make it possible to  compare,
              understand, and integrate results from all labs, providing  the experiments are
              clearly described to begin with.   ***
