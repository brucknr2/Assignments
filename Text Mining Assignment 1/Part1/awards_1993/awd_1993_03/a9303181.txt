Abstract    :
              9303181     Warren       This is an award for equipment to investigate the
              development  and scalability of algorithms and systems for parallel computers. 
               The instrumentation to be acquired include a number of high  performance
              parallel workstations, a scalable distributed memory  multiprocessor, and a
              high speed network.         The research supported by this infrastructure
              includes organic  chemical synthesis, automated theorem proving, very high
              speed  transaction processing, parallel prolog, 3-D graphics and volume 
              visualization, and simulations of massively parallel computers.  ***
