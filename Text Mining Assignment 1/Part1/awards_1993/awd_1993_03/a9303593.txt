Abstract    :
                   This action provides funds for Research Planning Grant                    
              to study the sedimentary record interactions between the                       
              Garlock and Southern Death Valley Fault Zones, California.                     
              The goal is to establish criteria for correlation of the                       
              structurally dismembered strata near the fault intersection.                   
              This will allow a more detailed study with the goal of                         
              testing the geometric models by delineating the timing and                     
              nature of fault motion.
