Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal entails the interdisciplinary study of multicomponent            
              polymeric glasses to develop a molecular level understanding of                
              macroscopic materials properties.  It is an industry-university                
              collaboration involving the fields of chemistry, physics, and                  
              engineering.  The projects include aspects which range from the                
              synthesis and preparation of materials through a determination of              
              engineering properties to advanced spectroscopic characterization              
              with an overall interpretation assisted by theory and modeling.                
              Systems selected for study are technologically relevant and                    
              suitable for study by nuclear magnetic resonance, such as                      
              polycarbonates and poly(phenylene oxides), in the presence of                  
              diluents.  Continued advances in the nuclear magnetic resonance                
              technique allow for new insights into molecular-level motion and               
              structural interactions which bear upon the materials properties of            
              these multicomponent systems.  Interpretational frameworks will be             
              sought to relate the nuclear magnetic resonance data to motion and             
              structure in the glasses.  A second tier of interpretation is                  
              required to relate motion and structure to the macroscopic                     
              characteristics of the materials.  In both cases, molecular                    
              modeling results will assist in the generation of an understanding             
              and also direct the nature of the experimental inquiry.
