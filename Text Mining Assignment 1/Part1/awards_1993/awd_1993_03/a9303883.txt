Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to exploit organozirconium                       
              reagents, resulting from standard zirconations of various                      
              alkynes, for ligand exchange reactions with Cu(I) reagents,                    
              particularly higher order cyanocuprates.  Vinyl zirconocenes                   
              generated from a number of compounds including acetylenic                      
              stannanes and acetylenic ethers afford reagents for multiple                   
              C-C bond constructions.  The transmetalation protocol will also                
              be extended to Ti and a study of titanacyclobutenes will be                    
              initiated.  NMR will be used to probe the aggregation states of                
              a number of interesting cuprates.

              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Bruce H. Lipshutz of the                        
              Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Santa                 
              Barbara.  Professor Lipshutz will focus his work on developing                 
              new syntetic methods that rely on the transmetalations of                      
              selected organometallic intermediates composed of Group 4                      
              metals with Cu(I) reagents.  The research will lead to the                     
              facile preparation of efficient reagents for C-C bond making.
