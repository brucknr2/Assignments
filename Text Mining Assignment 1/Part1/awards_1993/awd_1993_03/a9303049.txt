Abstract    :
                   This project will focus on problems arising in the field of               
              analytic torsion and the classical analytic torsion of Riemann                 
              surfaces. The work centers on classical moduli problems in                     
              theta-functions, analytic torsion and vector bundles on Riemann                
              surfaces. Studies of tau-theta functions constructed from                      
              analytic torsion, from the loop-group approach using the                       
              Szego-kernel and from matrix singular integral operators using                 
              abelian Cauchy kernels will be carried out.  The Szego-kernel and              
              theta-functions will be developed for monodromy groups on                      
              punctured Riemann surfaces; this will help in the further                      
              understanding of isomonodromy deformations on higher-genus                     
              Riemann surfaces and the spectral curve (double-cover) approach                
              to the moduli space of rank-two bundles.  There will also be                   
              research on the spin-zero torsion divisor and the meromorphic                  
              extension of the classical Bergman and Szego kernel-functions to               
              the moduli space of flat bundles with connections.                             
                   This work is related with both classical mathematical                     
              function theory as well as deep questions arising in mathematical              
              physics concerned with monodromy preserving deformations.
