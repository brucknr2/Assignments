Abstract    :
              9303817  Moog  Richard S. Moog is supported by a grant from the Theoretical  and
              Computational Chemistry Program to perform condensed phase  spectroscopic
              studies.  Two lines of research will be pursued.  The first study will compare
              the rotational reorientation of  Coumarin 102 dye in non-polar decalin with the
              reorientation  lifetime in fluorinated alcohols to see what the effects of 
              hydrogen bonding are on the reorientation times.  The second  study will
              examine the photoinduced double proton transfer  reaction of hydrogen bonded
              1-azacarbazole : alcohol complexes  in alcohol solutions and in dilute aprotic
              solvents.  Most of  the work will employ time resolved fluorescence
              measurements.  %%%  The physical and chemical properties of solutes are
              profoundly  influenced by the solution environment.  The influence of  solvent
              on chemical reactions and the dynamical processes which  occur in solution have
              been widely investigated.  This research  has shown that, rather than providing
              an inert and static  medium in which physical and chemical processes occur, the
               solvent often plays an active and crucial role in these  processes.  The
              investigvations to be performed by Moog will be  specifically directed at
              understanding the role which  intermolecular hydrogen bonding plays in solute
              reactivity and  dynamics in solution.  ***
