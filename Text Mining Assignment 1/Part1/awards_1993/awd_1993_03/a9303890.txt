Abstract    :
              9303890 Chave  A thorough evaluation of the ability of the combination of
              Horizontal electrometers (HEMs) and Inverted Echo Sounders (IESs) to accurately
              estimate volume and heat transports will be conducted.  Possible improvements
              of the accuracy of these estimates by adding bottom pressure sensors will also
              be investigated.  The HEM and IES observations gathered as part of the SYNOP
              (Synoptic observation of the Gulf Stream) program will be compared to the
              direct transport measurements obtained with traditional current meter arrays.
