Abstract    :
              9303397  Hagman  The proposed research is to measure the duration of tunneling
              or barrier transversal in quantum tunneling. Laser/STM experiments will be
              based upon modulation of the barrier height by the electric field of light
              rather than by current rectification as used in earlier studies.  A novel STM
              with decreased noise and increased stability has been designed for this work. 
              Numerical modeling based on energy fluctuations will be used to support the
              experimental work.  ***
