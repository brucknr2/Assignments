Abstract    :
              The principal goal of this research project is to determine                    
              by experiment the equilibrium partitioning of 18-O and 16-O                    
              between oxygen-bearing vapor and silicate glasses, melts,                      
              and crystals at low pressures over a wide range of                             
              temperature and silicate composition.  Of particular                           
              interest are the equilibrium fractionation factors between                     
              silicates and CO2 gas at pressures to 2000 bars, the                           
              equilibrium fractionation factors and apparent self                            
              diffusion coefficients for exchange between CO2 gas and                        
              felsic glasses and melts, and the fractionation factors                        
              between CO2 gas and minerals.  The results of the research                     
              will be applicable to interpreting the oxygen isotopic                         
              compositions of cogenetic igneous rocks in terms of                            
              petrogenetic processes and to developing a more complete                       
              understanding of the compositional and structural factors                      
              influencing the partitioning of oxygen isotopes in                             
              geological materials.
