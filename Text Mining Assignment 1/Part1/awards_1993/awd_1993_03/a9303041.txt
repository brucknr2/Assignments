Abstract    :
                   This project will use nuclear theory to probe issues of                   
              contemporary importance in astrophysics and particle physics.                  
              Nuclear effects that affect experiments to determine neutrino                  
              masses and oscillation parameters and experiments to detect                    
              and identify the dark matter that is believed composes most of                 
              the universe will be calculated.  An accurate treatment of                     
              beta-decay from the neutron-rich nuclei that play an important                 
              role in r-process nucleosynthesis will be developed, and the                   
              long-standing puzzle of nuclear structure physics with regard                  
              to the extreme hindrance of beta-plus transitions in the                       
              region of neutron numbers near 82 will be studied.  Studies of                 
              quark effects in nuclear systems will be pursued.
