Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposer intends to devote most of his research effort                
              on problems in the analytic theory of minimal submanifolds.  In                
              particular, questions about the nature of singularities will be                
              addressed.  Under consideration, will be the question of what                  
              types of singularities can occur, and whether singularities can                
              be perturbed away, by perturbing the data (that is, the boundary,              
              or the background metric), especially in codimension one.                      
              Similar problems in the theory of harmonic maps, and complete                  
              metrics of constant scalar curvature will be studied.
