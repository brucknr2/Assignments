Abstract    :
              9303140  Ross       This project will support undergraduate participants in the 
              advanced component of a Young Scholars Program in mathematics at  the Ohio
              State University during the summer of 1993.  These  students will participate
              in mathematics seminars designed to  enhance their mathematical development and
              will serve as  counselors to more junior students in the program.  The seminars
               will focus on independent explorations in mathematics, with the  goal of
              furthering the intellectual development and communication  skills of the
              students.  The counseling component will provide  them with experience in
              serving as mentors to other students and  thus enhance the development of those
              considering careers in  teaching.
