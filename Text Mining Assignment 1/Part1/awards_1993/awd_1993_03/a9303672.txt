Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Temporal Variations of Molecular Records of Sea Surface                        
              Temperatures & Plankton Productivity: Assessment of High                       
              Resolution signals in Sediment Trap particulates, etc.                         
                                                                                             
              This research is determining the temporal variability in alkenone              
              production and in the alkenone unsaturation index (UK37) used in               
              the evaluation of sea surface temperature (SST) variations.                    
              Analyses are being done on sediment trap materials collected in the            
              Gulf of California at 2 week intervals during the period August                
              1990 to February 1993.  The samples provide an opportunity to test             
              fluctuations in UK37 through multiple nutrient and plankton                    
              productivity cycles (including bloom periods of Emiliania huxleyi)             
              over an annual temperature range of ca. 15 Degree C and to directly            
              compare the molecular temperature values with measured SST.  Thus,             
              the proposed study will test the veracity of UK37, as defined for              
              normal marine conditions in Pacific waters, over multiple seasonal             
              oscillations and through a broad temperature range.  The                       
              investigation is also evaluating the molecular record of marine                
              plankton biomass and their diversity through multiple seasonal                 
              cycles.  The concentration profiles observed for biologically                  
              specific compounds will be compared with independent plankton                  
              counts obtained from concurrent micropaleontological studies on the            
              same samples by other investigators.  Thus, molecular trends will              
              be tested as signals of temporal variability in plankton population            
              dynamics.  The analyses will enhance the of molecular signals of               
              environmental and climatic change in the sediment record.//
