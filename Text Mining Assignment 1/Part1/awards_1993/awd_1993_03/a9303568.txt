Abstract    :
              9303568  Sooryakumar  This project will support the study of carriers in narrow
              channels  of widths comparable to the electron de-Broglie wavelength through 
              Fabry-Perot optical interferometry methods.  It will allow for the 
              determination of the plasmon dispersion, their lifetimes and  coupling between
              neighboring lateral wires that are vital to an  understanding of the electronic
              properties of quantum wires.  In  addition, the effects of electron-electron
              interactions on the spin  wave dynamics and elastic stability of bulk 3d
              ferromagnets will be  investigated through light scattering studies on a novel
              set of  Fe1-xCox epilayers.  This will provide important data on the  interplay
              between electron correlations and elastic stability, a  connection that has
              surfaced in recent year.  %%%  This project will support a laser spectroscopic
              study of charge  carriers in ultra-narrow channels a few hundredths of a micron
              wide  that underlie the next generation of high speed electronic devices.  The
              study focusses on the collective response of carriers within  individual
              channels as well as their coupling to neighboring  lateral wires.  In addition,
              the effects ofinteractions between  charge carriers, that present one of the
              greatest challenges to  understanding magnetism in metallic materials, will be
              addressed.   This will be investigated through optical spectroscopy and varying
               the strength of the electron interactions made possible by a recent 
              breakthrough in alloying different magnetic elements.  ***
