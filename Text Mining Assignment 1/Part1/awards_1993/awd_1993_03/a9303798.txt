Abstract    :
              Objectives are to understand the allosteric control of                         
              gluconeogenesis by the enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, in                 
              molecular detail.  Specific aims include: (1) development of a                 
              system for the expression of recombinant pig kidney fructose-1,6-              
              bisphosphatase at high levels without contamination from the                   
              fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase of the host system, (2) cloning and                
              overexpression of the E. coli fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase for                  
              comparison studies with the pig kidney enzyme, (3) use of the                  
              crystal structures of pig kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in the            
              T and R states, and functional studies employing single site                   
              mutants of the E. coli and pig kidney enzymes to begin to determine            
              the molecular basis of the switch between the allosteric states,               
              and (4) determination of how the regulatory effector AMP alters the            
              activity of the enzyme.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The degradation and biosynthesis of glucose are perhaps the most               
              important of all metabolic pathways because glucose is the primary             
              energy source for the brain.  Given that the body does not store               
              more than a one day supply of glucose, survival depends upon the               
              ability to synthesize glucose via gluconeogenesis, after the stored            
              supply of glucose is depleted.  These studies will be aimed at                 
              understanding the function of the enzyme fructose-1,6-                         
              bisphosphatase, an enzyme that exerts metabolic control over                   
              gluconeogenesis.  The enzyme's structure will be selectively                   
              modified via site directed mutagenesis and biophysical techniques              
              will be utilized to characterize the resulting changes in                      
              structure.  These structure changes will then be correlated with               
              alterations in biological function.  In this way specific aspects              
              of the structure of the enzyme will be correlated with particular              
              functions.
