Abstract    :
              The purpose of this conference is to provide an opportunity for                
              researchers and practitioners from academia, government and                    
              industry  to convene and exchange information and ideas. This                  
              meeting will provide an efficient means of transfer of                         
              information between those already actively using image processing              
              methods, as well as to inform those considering use of the                     
              technology in the future of the potential benefits.
