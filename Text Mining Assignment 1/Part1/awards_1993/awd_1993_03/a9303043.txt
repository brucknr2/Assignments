Abstract    :
               The goal of this research is the design, implementation, and  realistic
              application of a functional programming language  supporting the  development
              of scientific codes.  Functional  languages and scientific computing  appear to
              be singularly  mismatched.  The problem is not with the expressiveness  of
              these  languages, which is excellent, but their efficiency, which is  poor. 
              Recent research in functional languages suggests that assignment  may in fact
              be  consistent with referential transparency, if care  is taken in the overall 
              language design.  This research uses one  such language, the Imperative Lambda 
              Calculus (ILC), to develop  programs in the domain of random process modelling.
               Although  inefficiency on sequential processors has long been a drawback of 
              functional languages, their efficiency on parallel processors has  been a
              strong  attraction.  An important goal of this research is  to obtain an
              efficient  parallel implementation of ILC.  The  potential for success in this
              endeavor is  high because the  presence of assignment in ILC obviates the
              transformation to  imperative form, leaving the compiler to handle only the
              (well  understood)  problems of higher-order functions and lazy  evaluation
              themselves.  To fully  exploit modern parallel  architectures, especially
              non-uniform memory access  machines,  control over the placement of data and
              scheduling of tasks needs  to  be provided by way of parallel language
              extensions to ILC.
