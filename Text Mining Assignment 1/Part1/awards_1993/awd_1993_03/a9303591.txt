Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Chemistry Program supports study by Dr. John F. Hartwig of the                 
              Chemistry Department, Yale University, on transition metal                     
              complexes with boryl and borylidene substituents.  Borylidene                  
              complexes have not previously been prepared.  Boryl complexes                  
              of a wide variety of metals containing from zero to eight                      
              d-electrons will be synthesized using methods demonstrated by                  
              Hartwig in preliminary work.  Basic information will be                        
              compiled on structure and reactivity of this class of compounds                
              which has not been definitively characterized.  The boryl                      
              species are of direct interest because of their relevance to                   
              metal catalyzed hydroboration, which is widely used in organic                 
              synthesis, including stereospecific synthesis.  These compounds                
              may display novel reactions not previously observed in related                 
              compounds with metal carbon or metal oxygen bonds.                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Compounds which contain one or two bonds between a transition                  
              metal and a boron atom have not been extensively studied.  They                
              are analogs to other compounds containing metal-carbon bonds                   
              which are known to be useful catalysts for organic reactions.                  
              Because of the different electronic characteristics of the                     
              boron-containing compounds, they have been shown to have useful                
              catalytic properties, but their potential has not been fully                   
              explored.  Dr. Hartwig will develop synthetic methods for                      
              preparing metal-boron compounds, determine their structure and                 
              basic properties, and test their reactivity, particularly as                   
              related to their potential use as catalysts.
