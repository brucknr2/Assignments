Abstract    :
              9303865  Gasparik  The principal objective of the proposed research is to 
              determine the high pressure stability of majorite garnet in  volatile bearing
              systems and on the enstatite-diopside and  diopside-jadeite joins. The
              experiments will utilize mixes  of oxides or synthetic compounds and will be
              conducted in a  split-sphere anvil apparatus at pressures up to 230 kbar.  The
              results will find application in understanding the  composition, the role of
              volatiles, and the high-velocity  gradients in the Earth's transition zone.
