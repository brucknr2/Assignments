Abstract    :
                                                    9303019  Gao      This research addresses
              surface and interfacial phenomena in  polymeric light emitting diodes (LEDs).
              The objectives are to  understand the electronic states involved in
              electroluminescence  and the electronic and chemical structure of polymer/metal
               interfaces. Coordinated experimental studies of the interface  formation of
              poly(phenylene vinylene)PPV and a selection of  metals using x-ray
              photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), inverse  photoemission spectroscopy (IPES),
              electroluminescence  spectroscopy (ELS), and other surface sensitive probes
              will be  conducted. The combination of XPS and IPES in the same ultra-high 
              vacuum (UHV) system allows probing of both occupied and  unoccupied electronic
              structures independently and  simultaneously. Concurrent measurement of ELS is
              expected to  reveal relationships between light emission efficiency and 
              interface electronic structure and chemistry.  %%%  This research is expected
              to provide fundamental information  useful for the future development of
              polymer based flat panel  display technologies.  Parameters of practical
              interest such as  the thicknesses of the polymer and metal layers, different 
              degrees of conversion and different types of light emitting  polymers, and the
              stability of the LEDs will be investigated. The  project combines expertise in
              surface physics and polymer  chemistry, and is a joint effort between
              university and  industrial research scientists.  The interdisciplinary nature
              of  the project and the academic and industrial collaboration is  expected to
              uniquely benefit students and enhance the transfer of  knowledge from
              university to industry.  ***
