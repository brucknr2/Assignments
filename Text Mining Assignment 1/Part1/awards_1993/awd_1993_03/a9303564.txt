Abstract    :
              9303564  Sandwip    The objectives of this collaborative and interdisciplinary 
              research program reside in the unified exploration of a  potentially useful
              thin-film ferroelectric material, lead  zirconate-titanate, doped with varying
              amounts of niobium.  The basic studies will cover the fundamental science of
              sol-  gel solid phase epitaxial growth (SPE)which eventually  should lead to
              optimum commercial processing schedules.  The  research will include systematic
              studies of the  thermodynamics and kinetics of the epitaxial amorphous-to- 
              crystalline transition.  Specifically, the structural and  morphological nature
              of the microscopy (HTREM).  The role of  substrate orientation and aliovalent
              dopant niobium shall be  elucidated along with their transformation kinetics. 
              Additionally, capacitance measurements will be carried out  to provide an
              independent measure of the phase  transformation.  Moreover, a comparison
              between in-situ and  ex-situ   heat  treatments on SPE growth rates will be
              made  to gain a fundamental understanding of the basic processes  involved. 
              %%%  Epitaxial thin-film devices manufactured from these  materials have
              enormous potential commercial value including  electrooptic, piezoelectric and
              pyroelectric devices.  This  approach and much of the underlying science
              involved in this  proposal on ferroelectric thin films are new; hence, the 
              personnel involved will gain training in an area destined to  be of great
              importance in emerging science and technology.  ***
