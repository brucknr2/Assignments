Abstract    :
                   The proposed research covers several problems in microlocal               
              analysis.  In particular the analysis of elliptic operators on                 
              singular or non-compact spaces.  Certain approaches to conical                 
              and wedge-like singularities are proposed and applications to                  
              Hodge theory, the Yamabe problem and area minimizing                           
              submanifolds, are intended.
