Abstract    :
              9303356  Jacobson  The purpose of the proposed research is to study robust
              system  identification methods.  Robust system identification algorithms 
              produce models that are appropriate for use in robust design.  In  particular,
              the resulting models are accompanied by a  quantification of the identification
              error which allows a  subsequent design to proceed against a family of possible
               systems.  The combination of the envisioned robust system  identification
              methods from this research program with robust  design procedures from control
              and communication theory will  enable important technologies to operate at
              higher performance  and reliability than they currently are able to attain.   
              The research issues that will be addressed in this program are  the continued
              development of existing robust system  identification methods (in particular,
              to address practical  implementation issues), the extension of robust system 
              identification methods to classes of system models not previously  addressed
              (in particular, to time varying and finite time  duration processes) and the
              application of the system  identification algorithms developed to important
              technological  areas.  The application of the system identification algorithms 
              developed to important technological areas.  The relevant  application studies
              that are part of the proposed research  program are robust detection techniques
              involving underwater  acoustics and high performance control of a flexible
              structure.  ***
