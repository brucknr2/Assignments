Abstract    :
              Disseminated sulfide mineralization at the Babbitt Cu-Ti-Ni-                   
              PGE deposit of the Duluth Complex is found within iron-and                     
              titanium-rich gabbroic rocks that occur near the contact                       
              with metasedimentary rocks of the underlying Virginia                          
              Formation.  In order to evaluate possible metal sources Re-                    
              Os and Pb isotopic studies are planned.  These two isotopic                    
              systems will provide direct evidence as to the relative                        
              importance of crustal or mantle sources of metals                              
              Mechanisms of metal-enrichment will be evaluated by tracing                    
              chemical variations that accompany fractional                                  
              crystallization, crustal assimilation, magma recharge, and                     
              magma mixing.  The addition of crustal sulfur at Duluth is                     
              thought to be a prime reason for the differences in what may                   
              be a continuum  between sulfide-rich and sulfide-poor, oxide-                  
              apatite rocks.  Because of the chemical similarities a                         
              comparative study  with Fe-Ti-P-rich rocks from the St.                        
              Urbain and Labrieville anorthosite complexes in Quebec is                      
              planned.  Results will aid our understanding of similarities                   
              and differences between mineralization in layered                              
              intrusions, subvolcanic intrusives, and massif-type                            
              anorthosites and related  rocks.
