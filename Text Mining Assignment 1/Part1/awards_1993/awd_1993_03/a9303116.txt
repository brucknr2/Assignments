Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research in this project will focus on the fabrication and                     
              evaluation of a new apparatus to assess gas permeabilities                     
              through membranes and composite membranes.  A novel gas                        
              sampling system and automation of the equipment are to be                      
              examined as a means of providing high precision data of                        
              molecular transport with temporal resolution on the order of                   
              seconds.  Planned tests include study of metal-ceramic,                        
              polymer-ceramic and polymer blend membranes.                                   
                                                                                             
              Membrane separation processes are economical, energy-efficient                 
              methods which help to make American industry more competitive                  
              and environmentally responsible.  Development and                              
              characteristics of new membranes for gas separations can                       
              impact processing in the fuel industry, environmental efforts                  
              to control volatile organic compounds or greenhouse gases, and                 
              air fractionation for hospital oxygen supplies.
