Abstract    :
                   Pearcy will investigate the structure theory of various                   
              classes of operators that are related to contractions, including               
              the polynomially bounded operators, power bounded operators,                   
              weakly centered operators, hyponormal operators, and pairs of                  
              commuting contractions.  Techniques and results developed by                   
              Pearcy during the last 12 years involving the concept of dual                  
              algebra generated by one or several fixed bounded linear                       
              operators on Hilbert space will be used.                                       
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
