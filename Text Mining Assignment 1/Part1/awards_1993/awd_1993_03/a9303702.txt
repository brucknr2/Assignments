Abstract    :
                   Li will use the concept of dual algebra to study the structure            
              of bounded linear operators acting on infinite dimensional Hilbert             
              space.  In particular, the dilation theory of contraction                      
              operators, the invariant subspace problem, and the reflexivity                 
              problem will be considered for more general classes of operators               
              and dual algebras generated by more than one operator.  Li will                
              also continue her study of control theory via the commutant lifting            
              theorem.                                                                       
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently               
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
