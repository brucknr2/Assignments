Abstract    :
              9303456  Cole  Newly isolated mutations that cause specific lesions during 
              conjugal development in Tetrahymena thermophila will be  characterized by
              fluoresence and immunofluorescence microscopy in  combination with
              double-mutant analysis. The analysis should  identify significant developmental
              checkpoints as well as the  necessary and sufficient conditions for passing
              such  checkpoints.The biochemical control of chromatin condensation will  be
              studied by the use of conjugal-block mutants in collaboration  with Dr. David
              Allis. Conjugation mutations that produce 100%  penetrant conjugal-arrest
              phenotypes will be used to isolate secon-  site suppressor mutations in order
              to expand the genetic base of  our investigation. As possible, developmentally
              important genes  which complement conjugal-block phenotypes will be cloned. 
              %%%  Tetrahymna thermophila is a genetically complex but approachable 
              experimental system which can be induced to undergo conjugation  between two
              compatible mating types. This process will be dissected  by genetic and
              microscopic analysis and, when possible,  developmentally important genes will
              be cloned and preliminarily  characterized. Undergraduate students will be
              involved in the  research.  ***
