Abstract    :
                   This award covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics Research by a group at the University of California                    
              Los Angeles in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported                  
              scientists.  The group will continue studies on the                            
              possibility of doing B-meson experiments at proton                             
              accelerators.  They will continue the analysis of diffractive                  
              proton scattering at the CERN proton-antiproton collider.  The                 
              UCLA scientists will lead a test at CERN, Switzerland, that                    
              explores using data-driven parallel processors in heavy quark                  
              production experiments.
