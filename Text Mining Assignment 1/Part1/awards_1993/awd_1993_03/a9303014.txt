Abstract    :
              Gottlieb         This is a project to characterize and model the performance  of
              a scalable shared memory computer.  Ultracomputer uses a  multistage
              interconnection network with hardware combining to  provide high-bandwidth
              scalable connections between processors  and memory.  Ultra III, on which the
              work is being performed,  uses Xilinx parts to implement most of the glue logic
              in the PEs  (processing elements).  These can act as programmable performance 
              monitors at each processor.  These tools are being used to  evaluate the impact
              of combining on overall system performance,  measure the performance of
              scientific applications, measure and  compare alternative operating system
              designs, and construct  mathematical models of parallel system behavior.
