Abstract    :
              9303873  Canfield       The PI requests funds to operate the new Imaging Vector 
              Magnetograph at Mees Solar Observatory during the 1993 - 1995  period of
              declining solar activity, in support of both Max '91  campaigns and individual
              research projects.  Several community-wide  campaigns will take place during
              this period, associated with VLA  observing periods, magnetograph campaigns,
              balloon flights, and  rocket launches, and the PI will actively participate in
              these  campaigns.  As well, the PI will conduct an independent research 
              program whose goals will include:       1.  to determine from photospheric and
              chromospheric vector  magnetograms whether coronal magnetic fields in
              flare-productive  active regions are demonstrably not only non-potential, but
              also  non-force-free, and to understand the origin of such departures;       2.
               to understand the morphological relationship of  photospheric magnetic fields
              and current systems to bulk  energization and nonthermal electron acceleration
              and precipitation  in flares;       3.  to determine the temporal dependence of
              H  polarization  during flares, and to understand its relationship to energetic
               protons in the ill-understood sub-MeV range;       4.  to determine whether
              vertical currents observed in the  photospheric emerge from below, or are
              generated after emergence by  photospheric motions.  ***
