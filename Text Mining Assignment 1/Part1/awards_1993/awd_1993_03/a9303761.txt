Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Thomas to work              
              in combinatorics.  Specifically, much of this work will be                     
              centered in the area of graph minors.  A graph is a minor of                   
              another if the first can be obtained from a subgraph  of the                   
              second by contracting edges.  This area of graph theory is                     
              arguably one of the most signifcant ares in the past decade.                   
              Professor Thomas will also work in the areas of polynomial                     
              algorithms and mathematical logic.                                             
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
