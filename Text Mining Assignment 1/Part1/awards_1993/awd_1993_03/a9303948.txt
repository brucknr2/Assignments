Abstract    :
              9303948  Evans       This award provides one-half the funding necessary for the 
              purchase of an image analysis system to be installed on the  electron
              microprobe in the Department of Geological Sciences at the  University of
              Washington. The University is committed to providing  the remaining funds
              needed for the acquisition.       The electron microprobe provides quantitative
              elemental  microanalysis with a spatial resolution of one micrometer. The 
              capabilities of the microprobe are used by geoscience students and  senior
              research scientists in the fields of igneous and metamorphic  petrology, as
              well as for studies in geomorphology and  paleontology. The microprobe lab is
              also used in a variety of  studies by archeologists, astronomers (studying
              meteorites) and  biologists (studying hard parts) at the University of
              Washington.  The digital imaging system will greatly facilitate all of their 
              studies by enhancing the ability to view the spatial distribution  of elements
              with respect to sample morphology, and by quantifying  the size, shape, amount
              and distribution of selected sample  components from digitized images.  ***
