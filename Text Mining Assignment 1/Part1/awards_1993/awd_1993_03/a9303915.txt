Abstract    :
              Lindle  The Advanced Light Source (ALS) is a third-generation 
              synchrotron-radiation facility that offers unprecedented  opportunities for
              research in atomic and molecular science.  The new source will produce tunable
              radiation of high  intensity and uniquely high brightness in a continuous 
              wavelength range from the ultraviolet to hard x-rays. This  proposal is for
              construction of an end station on an ALS  beamline specifically designed for
              x-ray spectroscopy  research on free atoms and molecules. The proposal is 
              presented by a research team of 16 investigators from 12  universities and 4
              national laboratories, who plan to use x-  rays in a diverse program of
              fundamental investigations of  chemical and physical phenomena that are of
              primary  importance to the understanding of core-level processes in  atoms and
              molecules.
