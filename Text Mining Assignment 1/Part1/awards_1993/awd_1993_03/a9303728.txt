Abstract    :
              9303728  Fath  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research 
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from  Harvard
              University.  His Ph.D. research was in the area of  molecular biology using E.
              coli as the experimental system.  He  plans to carry out his postdoctoral
              fellowship research in the  laboratory of Dr. Robert Haselkorn at University of
              Chicago.  The  proposed research entitled "The identification of genes
              controlling  heterocyst differentiation in Anabaena" will broaden the training 
              of the Fellow into plant biology in general and plant developmental  biology
              and biological nitrogen fixation in particular.  ***
