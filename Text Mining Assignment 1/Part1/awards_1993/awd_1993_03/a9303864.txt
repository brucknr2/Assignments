Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for two years of                  
              operations and maintenance of the University of New Mexico/Sandia              
              National Laboratory ion microprobe facility. A used, but relatively            
              modern, ion microprobe instrument has recently been moved from                 
              Sandia to the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the                
              University of New Mexico. It is to be operated jointly by                      
              University and Sandia staff, and the available machine analytical              
              time will be split evenly between the two collaborating                        
              organizations. The analytical capabilities of the instrument                   
              include in situ measurements of trace elements and isotopic                    
              compositions with spatial resolution on the order of ten microns,              
              and it will be used in a broad variety of geochemical research                 
              projects by investigators from the University of New Mexico as well            
              as off-campus users.
