Abstract    :
              9303148  Kleinrock       This award provides support for the investigation of 
              collective behavior of a collection of autonomous, communicating  mobile robots
              (mobots).  Ths study will be accomplished through the  establishment of a
              laboratory to study distributed robotics  involving researchers form computer
              science, electrical  engineering, and mechanical engineering.  The award also
              provides  support for the acquisition of mobots and for the support of 
              technical staff to maintain the laboratory.         The main research topic
              pursued is distributed algorithms for  collective behavior.  The specific
              topics to be pursued are  communication improvements and protocols for wireless
              communication  between improvements and protocols for wireless communication 
              between robots, distributed motion planning studies for the robots,  and the
              application of maximum utility theory to the implementation  of collective
              behavior.
