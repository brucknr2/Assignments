Abstract    :
              9303184  Piestrup  The primary objective of the proposed work is the
              construction of a prototype x-ray-lithography source for the production of
              microintegrated circuits.  Using an available 10-kW electron beam the source
              will deliver a uniform x-ray distribution of 3-5 mW/cm2 over an area of 6 cm2
              at a distance of 2 m from the radiator.  The transition-radiation source
              without optics will deliver 48 mW of x-ray power in the 1-4 keV photon energy
              range.  Previously, we have obtained 15.2 mW of total power with a nonuniform
              power density of 1 mW/Cm2 at a distance of 3m.  Uniformity and collection of
              the x-rays will be accomplished by a novel x-ray capillary (Kumakhov) optic. 
              Phase I measurements and computer simulations show that good x-ray transmission
              through the lens can be obtained for the 1 to 3 key photon-energy range.  An
              existing high-current accelerator, x-ray beamline and optic aligner are
              available for this work.  A transition-x-ray lithography system promises
              performance that is superior to laser-plasma sources and is considerably less
              expensive than synchrotron sources.  ***
