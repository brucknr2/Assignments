Abstract    :
                   Robinson will continue his study of a periodic tilings of                 
              Euclidean space.  The approach is to view sets of tilings as                   
              compact metric spaces, and to study the dynamics of R^n acting on              
              such spaces by translation.  In this context, many standard                    
              dynamical properties correspond to important properties of                     
              tilings.                                                                       
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way, ergodic                    
              theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows              
              on homogeneous spaces.
