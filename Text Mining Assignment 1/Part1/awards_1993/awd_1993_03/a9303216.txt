Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with research in algebraic geometry               
              and category theory.  The principal investigator will work on                  
              using Chow varieties to obtain desingularizations of quotient                  
              varieties by algebraic groups and to construct higher-dimensional              
              generalizations of Grothendieck-Knuidsen moduli spaces of stable               
              punctured curves.  He will also develop the formalism of braided               
              monoidal 2-categories and apply it to the study of                             
              Zamolodchikov's tetrahedra equations.  In addition, he will study              
              Koszul duality for quadratic operads as motivated by graph                     
              cohomology; polyhedral syzygies among Steinberg relations in                   
              order to get a more formal algebraic approach to higher algebraic              
              K-theory; and the setting for generalizing the Langlands                       
              correspondence to 2-dimensional schemes by using a certain                     
              generalization of a concept of operad.                                         
                   This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of              
              the oldestparts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
