Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of G. Faltings with post-                
              doctoral associates S. Zhang and J-F Burnol to work on problems in             
              arithmetic geometry.  This includes problems in etale cohomolgy,               
              relations between modular forms and cohomology as well as moduli               
              spaces associated to G-bundles.                                                
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
