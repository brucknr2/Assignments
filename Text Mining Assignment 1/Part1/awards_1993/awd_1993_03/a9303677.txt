Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funding required to                  
              purchase a modern X-ray powder diffractometer to be housed,                    
              operated, and maintained in the Department of Earth Resources at               
              the Colorado State University. The University is committed to                  
              providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. Powder               
              X-ray diffractometry is an essential tool in earth science research            
              and teaching. Several research and teaching programs at Colorado               
              State  University in chemical weathering, soil production,                     
              groundwater alteration processes, climatic and vegetation controls             
              on soils development, economic geology, sedimentary geology, and               
              geotechnical engineering will benefit directly from this                       
              acquisition.
