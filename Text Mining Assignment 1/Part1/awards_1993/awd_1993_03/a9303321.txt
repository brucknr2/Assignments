Abstract    :
                   Stable isotopes such as carbon-13 can be used to analyze diets            
              of  mammals that inhabited the Amazon River basin during the late              
              Quaternary period, as well as local habitats and  regional                     
              climates.  Prior studies of fossil mammals and paleosol carbonates             
              indicate the Amazon has undergone major change within the last few             
              to several tens of thousands of years.  This assertion can be                  
              tested by assessing the types of plants eaten by herbivores of                 
              ancient ecological communities because: (a) incorporation into                 
              animal hard tissues (bone, dentine, enamel) of photosynthetic                  
              carbon is from only two sources  - -  C3 (Calvin cycle) plants or              
              C4 (Hatch-Slack cycle) plants, and the ratio of each type plant                
              gives a clue as to the composition of the prevalent vegetation at              
              the time; (b) isotopic content of carbon from carbon dioxide can be            
              measured by mass spectroscopy using pulverized fossil or carbonate             
              samples.  Analysis of carbonates precipitated in ancient soils and             
              fossilized bone, some of which was originally hydroxyapatite ?Ca10-            
              (PO4)6-(OH)2!, highly porous and subject to diagenesis (secondary              
              alteration of the original chemical composition).  More than 25                
              species of mammals from several Orders should be available,                    
              including Edentata (e.g., mylodont sloths, Megalonyx, armadillos,              
              glyptodonts), Proboscidea such as Haplomastodon, Perissodactyla                
              (Tapirus), Artiodactyla, and Notoungulata.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Results should yield insight into the question of whether the                  
              present Amazon rainforests were formerly covered at least to some              
              extent by grasslands.  These findings may in turn reveal to what               
              extent global changes have been directional or cyclic over extended            
              time periods.
