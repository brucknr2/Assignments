Abstract    :
                   This project involves three research projects in                          
              mathematical analysis.  The first concerns the change in spectrum              
              of the Laplace operator defined on automorphic functions in the                
              upper half plane modulo a confinite subgroup of SL(2,R).  The                  
              goal is to show that for the generic case, the asymptotic                      
              distribution of eigenvalues is less than the Weyl distribution                 
              calls for.  The second area focuses on the circle problem in                   
              hyperbolic space which, in its simplest form, compares the number              
              of lattice points in a plane contained in a circle with the area               
              of the circle.  Asymptotic values for the relationship have                    
              been steadily improved although comparisons with the Euclidean                 
              case are of no value. Work is proceeding on estimates of the                   
              error term in the cocompact case.  Finally, work is continuing on              
              scattering theory for symmetric spaces of noncompact type.                     
              Although this was developed in the 1970's, some of the published               
              work contains gaps (in addition to being quite                                 
              complicated). Efforts will be made to find a simpler and more                  
              coherent treatment - and to fill the gaps.                                     
                   Scattering theory arises in many contexts where one is able               
              to measure the outcome of an event in which hidden obstacles                   
              are present.  The theory seeks to extract information about                    
              the obstacles in terms of the initial and final data.
