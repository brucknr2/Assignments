Abstract    :
              9303183  Krulwich  Bacillus firmus OF4 is an extreme alkaliphile that can grow
              well  over a pH range from 7.5 to 10.7, and is also capable of growth  over a
              range of Na+ concentrations from mM to 1M.  This bacterium  lacks primary Na+
              extrusion mechanisms and apparently requires  electrogenic Na+/H+ antiporters
              for both pH homeostasis and Na+  tolerance.  Na+/H+ antiporter-deficient
              mutants have been isolated  from Bacillus subtilis, taking advantage of Tn917
              mutagenesis, in  order to develop system for heterologous screening and
              expression  of alkaliphile genes, and for comparative study of a neutralophilic
               Bacillus.  Using this system, and Tn916 insertional mutagenesis of  the
              alkaliphile itself, attempts are being made to identify the  remaining
              alkaliphile Na+/H+ antiporter gene (s) and possibly,  regulators thereof.  The
              relationship between each detailed  characterization will be undertaken of the
              Na+/H+ antiporter that  has the dominant role in pH homeostasis.  The basis for
              the  alkaliphile's generation of genetic variants will be studied.  Such 
              variants have the capacity for enhanced growth at the upper edge of  their pH
              range and at suboptimal Na+ concentration.  They have  previously shown to
              exhibit an increase in the already high  constitutive Na+/H+ antiporter
              activity.    %%%  This research will provide an understanding of how
              microorganisms  can grow under conditions of extreme pH and sodium variance. 
              This  could lead to applications such as bioremediation under  circumstances
              where it is currently not proactical because  organisms with the desired
              metabolic capabilities cannot grow due  to their sensitivity to strong basic
              environments.  ***
