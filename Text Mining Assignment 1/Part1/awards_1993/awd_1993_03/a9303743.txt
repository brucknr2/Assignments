Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from            
              Indiana University.  His Ph.D. research was on the molecular                   
              genetics of Rhodobacter.  He plans to carry out his postdoctoral               
              fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Sam Beale at Brown                
              University.  The proposed research entitled "Biochemical analysis              
              of the Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester oxidative cyclase from            
              Chlamydomonas" will broaden the training of the Fellow into                    
              biochemistry and enzymology.
