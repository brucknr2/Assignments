Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT   CTS-9303695  Glicksman     The proposed research focuses on the
              influence of bed hydrodynamics on the heat transfer occurring at the wall of
              circulating fluidized beds.  It is proposed to measure the mean time of contact
              for a cluster of particles at the wall and the mean distance the cluster falls
              prior to being shed.  The results for several different wall geometries and
              roughnesses will be compared in terms of a cluster or layer stability at the
              wall.  The mechanism of cluster deposition and its magnitude will be observed
              and related to the bed operating conditions, allowing the fraction of the wall
              coverage to be determined.     Experiments will be conducted on cold models to
              simulate the hydrodynamics and determine the influence of bed diameter and
              core/wall interactions.  These results will then be extrapolated to hot beds
              using previously verified cold simulation laws.
