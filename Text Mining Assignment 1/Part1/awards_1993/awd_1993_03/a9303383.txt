Abstract    :
              TITLE: Design, Implementation, & Application of a Framework   Formal deductive
              systems play a central role in the areas of  programming languages and logics. 
              First, they are used to  define languages  and their semantics at a very
              high-level of  abstraction (e.g., type systems or  operational semantics). 
              Second, they form the basis for the implementation of  algorithms pertaining to
              languages (e.g., type inference or  interpretation).  Third, they provide a
              common basis for the  study of meta-theory of  programming languages and logics
              (e.g.,  preservation of types under  evaluation).    Motivated by the
              tremendous variety of deductive systems of  interest in computer science and
              logic, general meta-languages  for their  specification have been investigated.
               These  meta-languages are often referred to as logical  frameworks.  The  
              objective of this effort is to further  the theory and practice of 
              logic-independent, computer-assisted  formal reasoning and meta-reasoning. 
              This  research addresses  definitional, operational, and meta-theoretical
              aspects of  logical frameworks comprising work on further design, 
              implementation, and  application of such frameworks.
