Abstract    :
              9303642  Kitten  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research 
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from  University
              of Texas Health Science Center.  His Ph.D. research was  in the area of
              infectious diseases in animal systems.  He plans to  carry out his postdoctoral
              fellowship research in the laboratory of  Dr. D. Kyle Willis at University of
              Wisconsin.  The proposed  research entitled "Overproduction, isolation, and
              functional  analysis of the LemA protein in Pseudomonas syringae" will broaden 
              the training of the Fellow into plant biology in general and plant  pathology
              in particular.  ***
