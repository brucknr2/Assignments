Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor James Milne to              
              work in algebraic geometry.  It has been known for several                     
              decades that there is a close and fruitful relation between the                
              arithmetic of abelian varieties and their degenerations, on the                
              one hand, and the arithmetic of Siegel modular varieties and                   
              their compactifications on the other hand.  Recently, Professor                
              Milne has found a similar relation between abelian motives and                 
              Shimura varieties of abelian type.  It is proposed to study the                
              degeneration of abelian type.  It is proposed to study the                     
              degeneration of abelian motives and exploit the relation in order              
              to obtain information about the compactifications of Shimura                   
              varieties over number fields                                                   
                   This research uses the techniques of algebraic geometry, one              
              of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had               
              a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                  
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                 
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                       
              robotics.
