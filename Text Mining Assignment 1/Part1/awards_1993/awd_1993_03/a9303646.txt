Abstract    :
              9303646  Lee  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research 
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from  Cornell
              University and her Ph.D. research was in the molecular  genetics of Drosophila.
               She plans to carry out her postdoctoral  fellowship research in the laboratory
              of Dr. Teh-hui Kao at  Pennsylvania State University.  The proposed research
              entitled  "Function of a pollen-specific receptor-like protein kinase of 
              Petunia" will expand this Fellow into plant molecular biology, cell  biology,
              and developmental biology.  She plans a short research  visit to University of
              Lyon, France during the Fellowship tenure.  ***
