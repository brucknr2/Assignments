Abstract    :
              This project involves a continuation of research on magma                      
              transport phenomena at both the microscopic and macroscopic                    
              scales.  The microscopic scale research will utilize                           
              molecular dynamics modelling to examine transport properties                   
              (viscosity, chemical diffusion) of melts in the system                         
              NaAlSiO4-SiO2.  The macroscopic scale research will focus on                   
              modelling and simulation studies of various anatexis models,                   
              of the behavior of silicate mush piles, and of radial                          
              zonation in granitic plutons.
