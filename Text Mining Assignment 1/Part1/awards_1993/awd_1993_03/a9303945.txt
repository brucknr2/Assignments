Abstract    :
              9303945  Sanders      This research is to image the attenuation structure of the
               Alaska subduction zone and overlying mantle wedge by means of  seismic
              tomography.  S-to-P amplitude ratios measured from  earthquakes located in the
              Alaska subduction zone and recorded by  the Alaska Earthquake Information
              Center seismic array will be  inverted for three-dimensional attenuation
              structure using an  algebraic reconstruction algorithm.  The resulting image
              will be  used to test hypotheses concerning metamorphic and thermal  processes
              at and above the contact zone between the subducted  oceanic crust and the
              mantle lithosphere.  In addition to  determining the thermal and petrologic
              structure of the subduction  zone, the study will constrain the importance of
              shear heating in  subduction zones and further our understanding of arc magma 
              genesis.  ***
