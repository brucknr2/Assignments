Abstract    :
              9303444 Fink We are the first group to identify a novel, 5S rRNA like sequence
              present in the genomes of sporulating bacteria like Bacillus species.  Analysis
              of the functional significance of this sequence may reveal a mechanism for
              transnational control of bacterial gene expression, which has not been examined
              in great detail.  We will use molecular genetic techniques to assess the
              functional significance of this sequence.  This work has the following three 
              objective: 1)          To examine the expression of the 5S rRNA like gene in B.
              subtilis cells.  We will use northern hybridization to detect the level of 5S
              rRNA like material present before and during sporulation.   h h #  2)       ( 
              To determine the nucleotide sequence of the 5S rRNA like gene from B. Subtilis
              cells.  From a library of B. subtilis DNA, we will isolate a clone containing
              the 5S rRNA  like region and discern the nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA.
              3) To identify the genetic location of the 5S rRNA like gene in B. subtilis and
              to study its biological significance.  We will map the gene by genetic crosses
              and attempt to delete this chromosomal region to study effects on the cell. %%%
