Abstract    :
                   This is a proposal to characterize stratigraphic                          
              heterogeneities and facies architecture in Pleistocene Lake                    
              Bonneville deposits of Utah, in order to better understand the                 
              control of depositional facies and fabrics in ground water flow                
              through Lake Bonneville and similar older deposits.  The                       
              established lake stratigraphy of the climatically sensitive basin              
              provides a framework for sedimentologic study.  The objective of               
              this study are to:                                                             
              1.   Examine and document facies architecture in select field                  
                   localities through analysis of geometries, hierarchical                   
                   stacking, sedimentary structures, and depositional fabrics.               
              2.   Compare depositional fabrics of facies on a petrologic and                
                   textural scale, with measurements of porosity and                         
                   permeability to determine the stratigraphic heterogeneities.              
              3.   Quantify sedimentary properties, architecture and                         
                   stratigraphic heterogeneities with 2-dimensional                          
                   geostatistical modeling (e.g. semivariograms).                            
              This study is significant in that it will greatly contribute to                
              understanding problems of surface contamination in Lake Bonneville             
              sediments and will provide analogues for evaluating flow units (or             
              hydrogeologic facies) in similar, older basin-fill aquifer facies.
