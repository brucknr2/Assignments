Abstract    :
                   This proposal is concerned with bounds for mean values in                 
              additive number theory, and the local solubility of simultaneous               
              additive equations.  The principal investigator intends to improve             
              estimates in Vinogradov's mean value theorem by incorporating the              
              ideas behind the new refinements in the corresponding work in                  
              Waring's problem.  These improvements will have consequences beyond            
              additive number theory.                                                        
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
