Abstract    :
                   The aircraft industry is at the forefront of integrated design            
              technology and world competition has generated the need for                    
              improved design methodology.  The purpose of this workshop is to               
              solicit the industry view on multidisciplinary aircraft design                 
              optimization and examine the best ways that university research in             
              this area can address industrial needs.  Topics will include how               
              design methodology fits industry plans for improved product                    
              realization, and how industrial, university and government research            
              can be coordinated.  The workshop will involve approximately                   
              twenty-five invited industrial presentations over two and a half               
              days.  There will be several panel sessions with industry,                     
              university and government participation and the proceedings will               
              be published.  This is an opportunity to promote                               
              industry/university cooperation and to develop a viable research               
              agenda for an industry critical to the United States economy.
