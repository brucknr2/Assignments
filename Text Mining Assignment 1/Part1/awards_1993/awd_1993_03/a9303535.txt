Abstract    :
              Among many mantle plumes, the Kerguelen plume stands out as                    
              a large, long-lived plume manifesting itself as the                            
              Kerguelen Plateau, one of the two giant oceanic plateaus of                    
              the world.  The P.I.s propose to investigate geochemical                       
              aspects of the evolutionary history of the plume.  Our                         
              effort will be focused into two separate projects:  (1)                        
              Basalt project (Frey) will focus on the old plateau basalt                     
              lavas in the northwestern province.  Geochemical                               
              characterization of these oldest basalts will present clear                    
              understanding of secular isotopic variations observed on                       
              younger eruptives.  Comparative studies between the                            
              Kerguelen and Hawaiian plumes will provide important                           
              information on how different parts of mantle plumes are                        
              tapped and on how mantle plumes evolve geochemically.  (2)                     
              Xenolith project (Shimizu) will focus on detailed                              
              petrography, mineral chemistry (major and trace elements)                      
              and isotopic compositions of lower crustal and mantle                          
              xenoliths.  The P.I.s intend to obtain definitive answers on                   
              whether granulites are pieces of ancient continental crust                     
              or young basaltic crust recrystallized in the granulite                        
              facies conditions.  Upper mantle xenoliths will also be used                   
              to investigate the plate setting, a possible involvement of                    
              ancient continental lithosphere, and interaction between                       
              plume-derived melts and lithosphere/asthenosphere.
