Abstract    :
              9303427  Light    The ability of animal cells to regulate their volume is one of
              the  most fundamental properties of living cells.  When cells are  exposed to
              hypotonic solutions there is an initial increase in the  volume of the cell
              followed by a regulatory volume decrease (RVD)  back to the original size.  The
              mechanism by which this process  occurs is not known.  This research will
              characterize the ion  channels involved in the RVD using the red blood cells of
              the mud  puppy, Necturus, which have been found to regulate their volume  with
              the involvement of potassium, calcium and chloride channels.  %%%  The ability
              of animal cells to regulate their volume is one of the  most fundamental
              properties of living cells.  The goal of this  research is to characterize the
              role of specific ion channels in  the process of cell volume regulation.  The
              results will not only  increase our understanding of the role of ion channels
              in the  process of cell volume regulation, but this research at an 
              undergraduate institution will provide an opportunity  for  undergraduates to
              participate in original research as a part of  their science education.  ***
