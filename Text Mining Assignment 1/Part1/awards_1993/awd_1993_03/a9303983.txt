Abstract    :
              9303983  Block       The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) 
              will conduct a project that will provide guidelines for those  educators who
              desire to improve the match of their mathematics  graduate students (master's
              and doctoral) to the needs of  business, industry, and government by
              characterizing both the  uses and users of mathematics in those sectors by
              identifying the  skills and attributes possessed by successful practitioners of
               nonacademic mathematics, by communicating this information to  employers and
              educators, and by initiating and promoting reform  in education for those
              master's and doctoral students bound for  careers in industrial mathematics. 
              Data from surveys and  interviews of selected graduates, their employers, and
              their  faculty will be analyzed and appropriate recommendations and  guidelines
              developed.       The objectives of the project are to (1) characterize the 
              demand for individuals with training in the mathematical sciences  at the
              master's and doctoral levels and the ways in which  training is utilized in
              industry; (2) characterize the skills and  attributes possessed by successful
              practitioners of nonacademic  mathematics as well as any perceived weaknesses
              of current  mathematics graduates; (3) formulate guidelines for educators who 
              desire to improve the match of mathematics graduate students to  the needs of
              industry; (4) create a continuing process to monitor  the progress of
              mathematics graduates in industry and to  disseminate this information to
              educators; (5) initiate  activities to increase among industry managers
              understanding of  how mathematical and computational analysis can be used 
              effectively to improve product design, manufacturing processes,  and other
              industrial functions; and (6) assess the value of  mathematics as perceived by
              influential managers in a cross-  section of U.S. industries.  The project
              consists of three tasks:  (1) a written survey with telephone follow-up of
              recent  mathematics graduates and their employers  and relevant faculty;  (2)
              site visits to industrial organizations and federal  laboratories; and (3) a
              survey of decision makers in industry  about the current and potential future
              value of mathematics to  industry.
