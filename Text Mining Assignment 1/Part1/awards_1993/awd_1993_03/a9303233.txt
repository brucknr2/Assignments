Abstract    :
              This research is in the area of interacting particle systems,  which are
              stochastic models for large systems of interacting  components.  These systems
              model such phenomena as competition of  species, epidemics, spread of genetic
              traits, and catalytic  chemical reactions.  The investigator plans to study the
              temporal  limit behavior of some particular classes of interacting particle 
              systems.  Specific models to be studied include the voter model,  a catalyst
              model, and an interacting diffusion model.  This research in probability theory
              is in the area of interacting  particle systems.  These are stochastic models
              for large systems  of interacting components.  Among the phenomena these
              systems  model are competition of species, epidemics, spread of genetic 
              traits, and catalytic chemical reactions.
