Abstract    :
              9303402  Bercovici         The spatial variability of hotspot signatures is a
              basic  feature of the dynamics of mantle plumes.  This variability is most 
              clearly expressed in the formation of discrete islands along the  axis of the
              Hawaiian chain, large wavelength variation in the geoid  and topography of the
              Hawaiian swell, differing geochemical  signatures of the volcanoes that
              comprise the islands, and in the  dual, parallel ridge system that exists on
              many of the islands.   The purpose of this project is to examine the causes of
              this  spatial variability in the context of the dynamics of mantle plume  heads
              spreading beneath and/or interacting with the lithosphere.   This will be done
              through a synthesis of geophysical and  geochemical data analyses with
              geodynamical modelling.  ***
