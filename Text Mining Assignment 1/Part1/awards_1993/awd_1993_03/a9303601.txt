Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from            
              University of Washington.  His Ph.D. research was in the area of               
              popular molecular biology.  He plans to carry out his postdoctoral             
              fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Vicki L. Chandler at              
              University of Oregon.  The proposed research entitled "Allelic                 
              interactions at the maize P1 locus" will broaden the training of               
              the Fellow into a hard core maize genetics, complementing his                  
              research experience with tree species and in molecular biology.
