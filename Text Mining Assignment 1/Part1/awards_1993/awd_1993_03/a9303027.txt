Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Matching funds are provided to replace a ten year old Indirect                 
              Current Plasma spectrometer system which is no longer functional.              
              The new direct current plasma emission spectrometer will be used by            
              faculty and students within the department for marine and                      
              continental rock and pore water studies.
