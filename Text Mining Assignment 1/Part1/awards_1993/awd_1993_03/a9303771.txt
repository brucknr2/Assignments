Abstract    :
                   Lawler will investigate a number of questions about the                   
              geometric properties of simple random walk and harmonic measure.               
              Included in the research is an analysis of the intersection                    
              exponent and resistance exponents, which are analogous to                      
              critical exponents in mathematical physics.  Diffusion limited                 
              aggregation is a cluster model based on random walk dynamics.                  
              The main goal will be to prove theorems about the growth rate,                 
              shape, and convergence rate for these clusters.                                
                   Random walk models are used in a number of areas of physics               
              and other natural sciences.  The investigator will continue                    
              research to understand rigorously the mathematical properties of               
              some of these models.  Of particular interest are problems on the              
              intersection of random walks and walks with constraints which                  
              arise in statistical mechanics and critical phenomenon.  Another               
              area is cluster formation, especially clusters which grow using                
              random walk dynamics.  These models arise in the study of                      
              dendritic growth and in the study of interfaces.
