Abstract    :
              9303764  Collins     Based on the low leakage, room temperature detector
              performance demonstrated in a successful Phase I program, AstroPower is
              proposing further development of gallium phosphide detectors for nuclear
              particle detection under operating conditions of room temperature or above. 
              The Phase II program will focus on developing and integrating the Phase I
              findings into high performance detectors.  The detectors designs that will be
              developed can be used in three different room temperature device configuration:
              (i) a single junction low energy spectrometer or high energy encounter, (ii) a
              single junction, thin {SYMBOL 68 \f "Symbol"}{SYMBOL 69 \f "Symbol"} detectors,
              and (iii) a multiple junction medium to high energy spectrometer.  These
              devices require the development of epitaxial growth techniques that yield high
              resistivity, thick layers with high crystalline perfection, and the development
              of processing techniques that yield high diode breakdown voltages.  An 
              important objective of this is to determine the specific energy range
              capabilities of GaP.  It is expected that gallium phosphide will be a superior
              replacement for silicon and germanium for a wide energy range of protons, alpha
              particles and photons in harsh environments.
