Abstract    :
              9303047  Chan       This award provides 56% of the funds required for the 
              Principal Investigator to purchase equipment that will be installed  in a
              paleomagnetics laboratory in the Geology Department at the  University of
              Wisconsin at Eau-Claire. The University is committed  to providing the
              remaining funds necessary.        The paleomagnetic equipment is to be used in
              measuring the  direction of magnetization of igneous rocks both in formal
              course  work and in research projects involving undergraduate students.  Such
              measurements are necessary to obtain an understanding of the  behavior of the
              Earth's magnetic field in the past and are also  needed to interpret the past
              deformation of the magnetized rocks  during tectonic events.  ***
