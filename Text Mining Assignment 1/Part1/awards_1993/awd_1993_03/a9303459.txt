Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is for the development of a surface analysis                      
              system equipped with latest generation high resolution                         
              electron energy loss (HREEL) spectrometer.  This instrument                    
              is capable of an increased signal of at least 20 times for a                   
              fixed energy resolution and 5 times better energy resolution                   
              compared to other available spectrometers.  These                              
              improvements will allow HREELS to be applied to the                            
              characterization of the vibrational properties of the                          
              surfaces and interfaces of a variety of technologically                        
              important materials, including, polymers, semiconductors,                      
              and metal oxides, at a new level of detail.  The projects                      
              for which the spectrometer will initially be used include                      
              the molecular characterization of polymer surfaces and                         
              interfaces, semiconductor surface and interface dynamics,                      
              and reactivity of metal oxide surfaces.
