Abstract    :
              9303522  Valdman      This dissertation research project will contribute
              significantly to  scholarly knowledge in two fields in which the need for
              greater  documentation is well known:  the sociolinguistic study of language 
              death, and the documentation and analysis of Cajun French (CF).   The research
              will involve two techniques, participant observations  in the CF community in
              and around Houma, Louisiana, and the oral  administration of questionnaires and
              a translation task to 40  members of the community falling into four age
              ranges:  over 60, 40  to 59, 20 to 39, and under 20.      The question of
              language death in this community will be approached  in two ways.  First, the
              questionnaire is designed to determine the  functional domains in which CF is
              still used.  By administering it  to representative members of the different
              age groups, it will be  possible to identify changes in the functional
              distribution of CF.   Secondly, the participant observation and the translation
              task are  designed to study six specific linguistic variables as a means of 
              identifying intergenerational differences in language skills.  An  additional
              time dimension will be added to the study in that some  of the variables to be
              examined have been looked at in previous  studies from the same areas of
              francophone Louisiana.
