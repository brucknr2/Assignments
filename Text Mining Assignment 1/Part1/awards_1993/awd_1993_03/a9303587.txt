Abstract    :
                   The Quaternary geology of the Great Basin of the Western U.S.             
              has much to offer in term of ice age climate records on land in                
              mid-latitudes.  Previous works have shown that the  continental                
              climate may have responded to astronomical (orbital) forcing in a              
              manner that could be quite different from the high-latitude glacial            
              response recorded in marine sediments.  However, the data base for             
              land-based records is rather meager relative to that for the                   
              oceanic realm and a rigorous comparison between the two records may            
              hold a key to our understanding of Pleistocene climates.                       
                   The objective of this project is to reconstruct the                       
              paleoclimate variations and water balance of the Western Great                 
              Basin during the past 35-40 thousand years.  The reconstruction                
              will take advantage of some recent important developments in                   
              isotopic techniques and in time stratigraphic work on sediments of             
              the Mono and Owens Lakes.  These developments enable us to                     
              quantitatively assess the paleoprecipitation/evaporation records in            
              unprecedented detail.  The isotopic tools to be used are 10Be/9Be              
              ratios, U-series disequilibrium, and stable isotopes 818O and 813C.
