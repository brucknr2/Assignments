Abstract    :
                   We propose to study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of               
              both unsteady and steady state singularly perturbed systems.                   
              Using asymptotic-numerical methods and singular perturbation                   
              theory, our results are expected to have more applications in                  
              fluid dynamics.  The proposed research activities will enhance                 
              the quality our research.
