Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on martingales and related classes               
              of stochastic processes and their applications, including                      
              applications to other parts of mathematics.  Concrete problems                 
              will be studied whose solutions will be applicable in statistical              
              and mathematical analysis.  At the same time, general methods                  
              will be sought that may help to solve some of the concrete                     
              problems that will arise in the study of stochastic integrals,                 
              singular integral operators, and the geometry of Banach                        
              spaces.                                                                        
                   The goal of the proposed research is to solve specific                    
              problems in mathematical and statistical analysis, and to develop              
              general methods that will aid in the solution of similar                       
              problems, not yet foreseen, that will arise in the future.  The                
              work supported by previous grants has led to new mathematical                  
              tools that have applications in industry, science, and                         
              technology. In all likelihood, the proposed research will yield                
              more new tools as well as sharpen old ones.
