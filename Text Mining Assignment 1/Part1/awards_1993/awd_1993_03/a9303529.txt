Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This workshop addresses current important scientific                           
              issues related to materials science, surface physics, and                      
              chemistry.  It will be held in Washington, D.C. from                           
              April 18 to April 21, and is organized in the style of a                       
              Gordon Research Conference.  It is designed to cover a                         
              wide range of surface microscopies: Transmission Electron                      
              Microscopy; Reflection Electron Microscopy; Low Energy                         
              Electron Microscopy; Low Energy Transmission Microscopy;                       
              Scanning Transission Electron Microscopy; Magnetic Imaging                     
              Microscopy; Scanning Reflection Electron Microscopy; X-ray                     
              Apsorption Microscopy; Photoelectron Electron Microscopy;                      
              Field Ion Microscopy; Scanning Tunneling Microscopy; and                       
              Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction.                                   
                                                                                             
              In addition to providing a review of current techniques,                       
              the workshop will address the directions that these                            
              techniques will be headed in the future in terms of the                        
              scientific data that they can provide.  A report will be                       
              prepared for publication in the open literature.
