Abstract    :
                   The proposed investigation includes research into Ricci-flat              
              manifolds with Euclidean volume growth, heat equation methods                  
              with adiabatic limit techniques for investigating spectral                     
              properties of differential operators.  Tian will continue                      
              research into extremal Kahler metrics and their moduli.  There                 
              are intended connections with gauge theory and general                         
              relativity.
