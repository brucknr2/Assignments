Abstract    :
              9303656  McKhann  This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research 
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from  University
              of California at Los Angeles.  Her Ph.D. research was in  the area of
              biological nitrogen fixation with emphasis on molecular  biology.  She plans to
              carry out her postdoctoral fellowship  research in the laboratory of Dr. Adam
              Kondorosi at the Institut  des Sciences Vegetales in Gif sur Yvette, France. 
              The proposed  research entitled "Functional characterization of a higher plant 
              MAP kinase" will expand the scientific experience of this Fellow  into cell and
              developmental biology.   In addition, her stay at  CNRS will add an
              international perspective to her research  experience.  ***
