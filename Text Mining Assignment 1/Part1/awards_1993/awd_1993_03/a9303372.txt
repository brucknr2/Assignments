Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The P. I. will do research on the complexity theory of                    
              continuous problems and dynamical systems.                                     
                   The research involved is of interest to a large class of                  
              mathematicians and has implications for the relations between                  
              abstract mathematics and computer sciences.
