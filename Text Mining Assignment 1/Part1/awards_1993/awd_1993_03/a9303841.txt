Abstract    :
              9303841  Han    This is an examination of an alternative approach to the
              extraction  of precious metals from refractory ores; the approach is intended 
              to pose a much lesser threat to environmental quality than the  presently
              predominant cyanide leaching process.  The dissolution  mechanism of gold in
              ammoniacal solution at elevated temperature  and pressure is studied.  Unique
              features of the  approach include  use of relatively high temperature and
              pressure in an autoclave,  use of oxygen to regenerate the copper or cobalt
              oxidant, and  measurement of electrochemical potentials at high temperature in
              an  autoclave modified for this purpose.  The oxidation of sulfide in 
              ammoniacal solution is also investigated.    If fully successful, this effort
              should result in a process that  would pose a much lesser environmental problem
              than current  technology, and would also permit extraction of gold (and maybe 
              silver) from ores presently considered refractory.
