Abstract    :
              The diffusion of molecular species on solid surfaces is an                     
              important step in most heterogeneous reaction mechanisms. The                  
              detailed investigation of surface diffusion is the subject of                  
              this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface                  
              Chemistry Program.  A pulsed molecular beam-surface infrared                   
              spectrometer system has been constructed to investigate the                    
              transport of CO, NO, and substituted isonitriles on stepped                    
              palladium and nickel surfaces.  Step and terrace populations                   
              will be characterized, low and high coverage diffusion                         
              measurements made, and transient mobility studies carried out                  
              during the course of this project.  This work will provide a                   
              very comprehensive picture of molecular transport on well                      
              characterized surfaces.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The transport of molecules across surfaces is an important step                
              in reactions which are mediated by these surfaces.  In order to                
              develop a detailed understanding of surface reactions such as                  
              corrosion and catalysis, information about the mechanism and                   
              rate of surface diffusion must be obtained.  This research                     
              project combines molecular beam dosing methods with surface                    
              infrared spectroscopy to directly measure the diffusion of                     
              small molecules on catalytically important surfaces.
