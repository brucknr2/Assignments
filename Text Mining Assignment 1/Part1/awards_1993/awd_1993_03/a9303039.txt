Abstract    :
              9303039  Mancini       Preliminary study of Upper Cretaceous strata of the
              eastern  Gulf Coastal Plain indicates that this succession lends itself well 
              to sequence analysis for intrabasin and potentially interbasin  correlation. 
              PI and collaborators will investigate strata of  Tennessee, Mississippi and
              Alabama to provide a high-resolution  biostratigraphy, to identify and map key
              stratigraphic surfaces, to  define depositional systems tracts and associated
              sequences, to  compare these sequences to globally recognized ones, and to seek
               evidence for controls on cyclicity.  This work will provide useful 
              correlation tools regionally, and has the potential to test global  sequence
              analysis for this critical time period in Earth history.
