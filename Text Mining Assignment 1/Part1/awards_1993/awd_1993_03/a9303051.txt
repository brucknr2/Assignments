Abstract    :
                   Kennedy will study itinerant fermion and quantum spin                     
              systems.  The nature of the ground state of one of the simplest                
              itinerant fermion systems will be studied in detail.  In                       
              particular he will investigate whether there is a 3-dimensional                
              analog of the recent 2-dimensional result that for the neutral                 
              model in a certain range of densities the ions are always                      
              arranged in diagonal lines.  He will also study the localization               
              problem for a system of particles moving in a random potential.                
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
