Abstract    :
              9303416  Jajodia    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   The goal of this project is to investigate issues related to both 
              mandatory and discretionary security in object-oriented database  systems.  The
              database security model, called the message filter  model, proposed recently by
              Jajodia and Kogan is used as a  departure point for this research.  The chief
              advantages of the  message filter model are its compatibility with the
              object-oriented  data model and the simplicity with which security policies can
              be  stated and enforced.  Topics that are being investigated include:  (1) how
              multilevel entities can be modeled in the message filter  model, operational
              semantics of update operations, and  implementation of a secure garbage
              collection mechanism that does  not have to be trusted; (2) how the conflict
              between integrity and  secrecy requirements can be overcome using the
              object-oriented  approach; and (3) how the message filter model can be extended
              to  incorporate discretionary controls.  Access control is a crucial 
              functionality for any data management system.  This research will  lead to a
              security model specifically targeted to object-oriented  database systems,
              without compromising the advantages provided by  the object-oriented approach
              over conventional approaches.   ***
