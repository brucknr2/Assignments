Abstract    :
              The PIs will measure the excess brightness of the Sun in the CaII  K-line,
              bringing up to date the sequence of measurements obtained  at McMath-Hulbert
              from 1944-1979, and at Big Bear from 1979-1987.   The CaII index is an
              important measure of the level of solar  activity, solar ultraviolet emission,
              and excess solar constant  emission.  As such, it plays a basic role in the
              SunRISE program.   The measurements in this project will separately evaluate
              the  emission from highly active regions, normal plages, and the  chromospheric
              network, all of which are known to be associated with  sources of ultraviolet
              emission.***
