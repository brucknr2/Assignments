Abstract    :
              Finding the exact solution to a number of fundamental  optimization problems
              (such as Bin Packing, Travelling  Salesperson Problem, Vehicle Routing
              Problems) is very likely to  be intractable.  One method of gaining an
              understanding of these  problems is to study them as stochastic models.  It is
              then  possible to estimate the average behavior of the optimal solution  and
              develop procedures that will produce solutions that, on  average, are close to
              the optimal.  The past research of the  investigator has demonstrated the
              relevance and the power of  various methods of this approach.  The main
              objective of this  research is to make further methodological progress in the 
              understanding of these stochastic models.  In an overwhelming number of
              practical situations, one is faced  with the problem of choosing, among a
              usually astronomical number  of possible configurations, the one with the
              lowest cost  (=optimal).  Even in very simple cases, this is intractable. 
              Since these problems must nonetheless be dealt with, getting a  deeper
              understanding of them is a goal of considerable  importance. One way to gain
              insight is to study these problems  under random input. Past research has
              demonstrated the relevance  to that study of sophisticated tools from various
              branches of  mathematics. The main objective of the present proposal is to 
              make further methodological progress through the study of a  number of concrete
              questions that crystalize the limits of  today's techniques.
