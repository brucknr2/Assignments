Abstract    :
                   This award supports the study of homological aspects of the               
              representation theory of algebras. In particular, the principal                
              investigator will study the cohomology ring of group rings, of                 
              finite dimensional algebras and of graded algebras.  He will also              
              study the structure of Hopf algebras and the homological                       
              properties of the quotients of the letter-place algebras which                 
              arise in the invariant theory of the symmetric groups.  This                   
              project also involves the continued development a symbolic                     
              algebra package for noncommutative rings which will be used                    
              extensively for this research project.                                         
                   This project is in the general area of noncommutative                     
              algebra and the computer-aided computational aspects of this                   
              field.  There is a growing interest in using computers to answer               
              theoretical questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite              
              useful for the development of algorithms.  This project makes                  
              serious use of both the theory and practice of symbolic                        
              calculations to solve real problems in noncommutative algebra.
