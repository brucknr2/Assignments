Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for the                           
              international symposium on Directions in General Relativity                    
              to be held at the University  of Maryland, College Park,                       
              during May 27-29, 1993.  The NSF funds will provide travel                     
              and subsistence for graduate students to attend the                            
              symposium, where they will be able to interact with leading                    
              experts in the field.  Present at the symposium will be many                   
              of the theorists who are most active in general relativity.                    
              One of the talks will deal with the LIGO project, which is                     
              being funded by the NSF.
