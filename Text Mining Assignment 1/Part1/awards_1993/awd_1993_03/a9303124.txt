Abstract    :
              9303124  Heimbach         This grant will allow an existing UNIDATA system at
              the  University of North Carolina to expand the capability and  accomodate
              anticipated UNIDATA products.  The long term goals of  this project are to
              implement a system compatible with the UNIDATA  Internet data transmission
              being developed, to interface with the  UNIDATA community, and to reduce the
              cost of data access.  ***
