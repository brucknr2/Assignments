Abstract    :
                  9303013  Grishman      This is the second year of a collaborative project
              between Monmouth  College and New York University seeks to gather
              correspondences  between expressions in source and target parallel corpora in 
              Japanese and English with the objective of generalizing these  correspondences
              to create rules for use in a translation system.   The performance of
              translation systems has been often limited to a  great extent by our ability to
              encode information about such  correspondences manually.  In this project the
              texts in the source  and target languages are parsed and then syntactically
              regularized,  producing regularized parse trees.  A tree-matching procedure 
              aligns the corresponding trees from the source and target texts,  producing a
              set of detailed correspondences between source and  target structures.  A set
              of sublanguage (semantic) word classes is  then defined and these
              correspondences are generalized to the  extent possible using these word
              classes; the result is a set of  rules for the transfer phase of a translation
              system.  The approach  uses corresponding programming language manuals written
              in Japanese  and English.
