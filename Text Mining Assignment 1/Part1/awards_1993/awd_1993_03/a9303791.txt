Abstract    :
              9303791  Davidson  Twenty years of high precision bulk geochemical analyses, 
              while broadening our overall understanding as to the role of  contributing
              components, has failed to provide a complete  model for magma genesis at
              convergent margins.  Until magma  chamber processes can be identified,
              understood and  quantified, grand unifying hypotheses will continue to be  the
              subject of circular debate.  We propose a different  approach.  Chaos Crags in
              the Lassen Volcanic National Park  has long been recognized as the classic
              result of magma  mingling (Heiken and Eichelberger, 1980).  By sampling at  the
              length scales of interaction (mm-cm; rather than hand  samples) we aim to
              achieve a quantitative understanding of  the mingling process, its effects on
              bulk chemistry, and its  overall importance to the sustained evolution of the 
              southernmost volcanic edifice of the Cascade Range.
