Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in the area of vortices in                   
              algebraic and symplectic geometry.  It is based on earlier work                
              by the investigator on vortices and stable holomorphic pairs.                  
              Vortices are minima of Yang-Mills-Higgs energy, and holomorphic                
              pairs are holomorphic vector bundles with prescribed holomorphic               
              sections.  This research concerns new directions in the study of               
              vortices and stable pairs and involves a generalization of the                 
              notion of a pair to that of a triple consisting of two                         
              holomorphic bundles together with a holomorphic bundle                         
              homomorphism.  This will address the way in which objects can be               
              obtained by a dimensional reduction of an equivariant stable                   
              bundle on the Cartesian product of the Riemann surface with the                
              projective line.                                                               
                   This award is in the general area of geometry and, in                     
              particular, in algebraic and symplectic geometry.  This research               
              will aid in our understanding of 4-dimensional manifolds and are               
              central to the current research in 'gauge theory'.  In lay terms,              
              a 'manifold' plays the role of a surface.
