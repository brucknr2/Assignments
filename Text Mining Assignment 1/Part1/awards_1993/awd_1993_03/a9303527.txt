Abstract    :
              9303527  Shapiro    VLBI Astrometry.    The technique of
              very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) has been used with  radio telescopes
              girdling the globe to determine the sky positions of compact  radio sources
              with uncertainties of one milliarcsecond or less and the relative  positions of
              neighboring sources with uncertainties as low as 12  microarcseconds.  Dr.
              Shapiro and his colleagues at Harvard University will  continue using this
              technique to: (a) determine galactic and extragalactic  distances and to
              estimate the Hubble constant; (b) measure, or place bounds  on, the proper
              motions of several extragalactic radio sources in order to  improve our
              understanding of the nature of these sources and to improve the  extragalactic
              reference frame; and (c) tie this frame to the solar-system  reference frame.
