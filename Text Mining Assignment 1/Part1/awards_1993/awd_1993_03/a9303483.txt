Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in algebraic K-theory.  The                  
              principal investigator will work on understanding the K-groups of              
              an exact category, as defined by Quillen.  One major goal is to                
              build on the recent discovery of a simple algebraic description                
              of the first K-group by finding relations among these elements                 
              and doing some calculations.  An analog of this description for                
              higher K-groups will also be sought.  In addition, the principal               
              investigator will continue to work on Gersten's conjecture.                    
                   This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory.  In a                 
              broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution of concepts              
              from linear algebra such as basis and vector space.  This work                 
              has significant implications for number theory and algebraic                   
              geometry, and promises to make exciting connections between a                  
              number of different areas in mathematics.
