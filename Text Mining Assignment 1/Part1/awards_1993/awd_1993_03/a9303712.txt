Abstract    :
                   This award supports investigations into the algebraic theory              
              of quadratic forms over fields of characteristic different from                
              two and over schemes proper over such fields, especially complete              
              regular curves with a rational point.  In particular,  the                     
              principal investigator will investigate symmetric bilinear spaces              
              over a scheme and their equivalence classes in the Witt ring                   
              utilizing geometric and etale methods.  He will also study Galois              
              cohomology with 2-adic coefficients and its relationship to                    
              quadratic form theoretic questions.                                            
                   The research supported involves the theory of quadratic                   
              forms.  This, in its simplest form, is the study of polynomial                 
              forms of degree two.  Equivalently, it is an analysis of the                   
              types of inner products that can define the metric geometry of an              
              n-dimensional vector space.  The study of quadratic forms has                  
              deep interrelations with algebraic geometry and algebraic                      
              k-theory.
