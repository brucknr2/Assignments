Abstract    :
                                                                            9303187  Bolt 
              This action is to continue a collaboration in the recording  of earthquake
              strong ground motion, between principal  investigators at the University of
              California at Berkeley  and at the Institute of Earth Sciences, Academica
              Sinica,  Taiwan.  This collaboration began with the NSF-funded  installation in
              Taiwan of SMART-1 (Strong Motion Array in  Taiwan-1) headed by the principal
              investigator.  Since that  time, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the
               Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) have collaborated  with Taiwan Power
              in the complimentary recording of strong  ground motions through a
              smaller-scale array within SMART-1,  for soil-structure interaction studies
              motivated by needs in  nuclear power plant design.    This collaboration is
              being repeated with the installation  of the Taiwan-funded SMART-2 array at a
              stiffer soil site at  Hualien.  The Taiwan Weather Bureau is now installing 600
               strong-motion recorders distributed around the island of  Taiwan.  NSF-funded
              investigators from the University of  Houston and the University of Southern
              California are  participating in this data-gathering program, and the 
              principal investigator is involved separately as chairman of  a technical
              review panel for the strong-motion recorders  being installed.    This action
              is to: (1)  support collaboration in  dissemination and processing of seismic
              ground motions being  recorded by the new digital accelerograph array
              (SMART-2);  (2) assist in the integration of SMART-2 data with that from  the
              smaller-scale 3-D array; and (3) continue research  using new SMART-1 and
              SMART-2 data, on measuring, comparing,  understanding and characterizing
              variations of strong ground  motion paralleling those at SMART-1 on "soft"
              soil.  ***
