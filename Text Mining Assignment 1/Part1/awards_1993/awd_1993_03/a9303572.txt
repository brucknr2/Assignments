Abstract    :
              Prolactin (PRL) is a single-chain polypeptide hormone that elicits             
              a wide variety of physiologial responses in vertebrates; in mammals            
              these include growth and development of the mammary gland and                  
              lactation.  In recent years it has also become evident that PRL                
              exerts marked effects on the immune system and several types of                
              immune cells possess PRL receptors: for example the hormone is a               
              powerful, lactogen receptor-mediated mitogen for rat Nb2 pre-T                 
              lymphoma cells.  PRL is considered to be a member of a hormone                 
              famioly which includes growth hormone and placental lactogen, and              
              these hormones are believed to share a similar three-dimensional               
              structure.  There is considerable interest in determining which                
              regions of these polypeptides are functionally important.  The                 
              principal objective of the proposed research is to define the amino            
              acid residues in PRL which are responsible for its biological                  
              activities, particlarly its mitogenic action on Nb2 cells.  The                
              availability of these cells makes possible a detailed structure-               
              function analysis of PRL with regard to its action as a growth-                
              stimulating factor.  The Nb2 cell will be used as tools in these               
              studies of how the structure of PRL affects its biological                     
              activity.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The study of prolactin and growth hormone has wide application,                
              since these hormones regulate numerous physiological processes for             
              normal and disease states in humans, and for the reproduction,                 
              development, and productivity of economically valuable livestock.              
              Althugh these studies are basis, by concentrating on bovine                    
              prolactin and growth hormone, and on the bovine mammary gland
