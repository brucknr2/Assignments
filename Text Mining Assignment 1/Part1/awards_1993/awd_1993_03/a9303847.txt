Abstract    :
                   A particular model for the treatment of the                               
              fragmentation process in heavy-ion collisions will be                          
              investigated.  The transition-state treatment, based on a                      
              generalization of the method commonly used to study nuclear                    
              fission, will serve as the basis for a computer code aimed                     
              at predicting the mass, energy, momentum, and spin                             
              distributions of the fragments that emerge from energetic                      
              nuclear collision.
