Abstract    :
              9303152  Ehrich       This award provides infrastructure for the support of 
              laboratories for research in interactive computing, especially as  it relates
              to human/computer interface studies.  The principal  investigators are drawn
              from the department of Computer Science and  the department of Industrial and
              Systems Engineering.  In addition,  there are substantial collaborations with
              the Naval Research  Laboratory and the Blacksburg Electronic Village.  The
              laboratories  are a Usability Methods Research Laboratory, an Interaction 
              Technology Laboratory, and an Information Access Laboratory.  This  award is
              being jointly funded by the Cross Disciplinary Activities  (CDA) Office and the
              Information, Robotics, and Intelligent Systems  (IRIS) Division.  The
              Instrumentation for the laboratories is being  supported by CDA while the
              research is being supported by IRIS.         The specific research performed in
              the laboratories includes  identifying and over coming usability and
              conceptional barriers to  computing, the development of evaluation
              methodologies for  determining the effectiveness of human/computer interfaces, 
              development of environments for performing human/computer interface 
              experiments, the development of expert-based information systems,  the
              development of systems for access to computers for disabled  users, and
              development of systems for access to computers for  disabled users, and
              development of several domain based interfaces  for large data base systems.
