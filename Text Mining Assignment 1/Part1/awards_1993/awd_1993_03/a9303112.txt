Abstract    :
              9303112  Morrison    A combined experimental and theoretical investigation will
              be  carried out addressing the issue of melt fracture in the  processing of
              polymeric materials. A set of experiments with  monodispersive polybutadine and
              polystyrene will be conducted  in various shear flows. The results will be
              compared to  existing and new calculations on a variety of constitutive 
              equations which predict viscoelastic instabilities. The  investigators hope to
              establish an unambiguous constitutive  explanation of melt fracture.    If the
              investigators succeed in establishing such an  interpretation of a so far
              ambiguous and controversial  phenomenaon, it will open the door to eliminating
              failures  from melt fracture in the processing of polymeric materials.  ***
