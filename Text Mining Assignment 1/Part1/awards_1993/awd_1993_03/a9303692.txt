Abstract    :
                   Research by geographers, regional scientists, economists,                 
              sociologists, and other scholars on the operation of contemporary              
              economic systems has documented the importance of ethnic networks              
              in traditional consumer-oriented ethnic businesses.  Recent                    
              economic geographic research has stressed formal and informal                  
              production networks as an emerging aspect of industrial                        
              organization in advanced economies.  Little research has been                  
              conducted, however, on the role of ethnic ties or other informal               
              social relations in the producer-services sectors.  This doctoral              
              dissertation project will examine ethnic networks among Chinese                
              enterprises in various producer-services industries of the Los                 
              Angeles area in order to better understand the influence of                    
              ethnic relations on production-oriented sectors of the economy.                
              The research will use statistical methods to analyze information               
              gathered through surveys and intensive interviews, with special                
              emphasis placed on examining the locational and sectoral                       
              concentration of Chinese firms, the extent to which Chinese firms              
              depend on ethnic networks for capital, information, employees,                 
              supplies, and clients, and the dynamics through which ethnic                   
              networks function.                                                             
                   In addition to adding to focused knowledge about the spatial              
              and operational dynamics of firms run by one of the largest and                
              most active ethnic  groups in a rapidly growing sector in the Los              
              Angeles area, this research will provide valuable new insights                 
              into the role of social networks in contemporary economic                      
              transformations functioning elsewhere in the U.S. and the world.               
              As a doctoral dissertation improvement award, this award also                  
              will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a              
              strong independent research career.
