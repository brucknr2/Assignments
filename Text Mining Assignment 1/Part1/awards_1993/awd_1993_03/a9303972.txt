Abstract    :
              This project will extend ongoing research on the                               
              thermodynamic properties of  cummingtonite solid solutions                     
              to include quadrilateral amphiboles.  The study will utilize                   
              previously published thermodynamic and Mossbauer data and                      
              results of new x-ray crystal structure refinements.  The                       
              resultant data will provide insight into modelling the                         
              thermodynamics of complex clinoamphiboles.  Ultimately it                      
              will find application in the construction of phase diagrams                    
              for use in the interpretation of metamorphic systems.
