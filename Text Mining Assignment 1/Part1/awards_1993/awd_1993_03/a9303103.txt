Abstract    :
              Hildebrand  9303103             This experiment will deploy a broad-band seismic
              instrument at the  Ocean Seismic Network- 1 site, a borehole site chosen to
              test  instrumentation and noise levels for future deployment of a  permanent
              seafloor seismic observatory. The instrument uses both  long period and short
              period seismic sensors as well as a long  period differential pressure gague
              and a conventional hydrophone.  The deployment will provide signal and noise
              records relevant to  future use of the site, and would occur during an already
              planned  borehole wireline re-entry expedition.
