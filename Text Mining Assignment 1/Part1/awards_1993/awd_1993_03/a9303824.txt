Abstract    :
              9303824  Gehrels       The Coast Mts. Orogen of the North American Cordillera, 
              comprises several important tectonic features, including one  of the largest
              batholiths in the world, a major suture zone,  regionally extensive upper
              amphibolite granulite facies  rocks and a  major thrust belt.  This research
              will  determine the detailed geochronology of the major structures  and
              integrate the findings with interpreted plate motions.  The results will
              provide tight constraints on timing and  style of plate-margin processes,
              especially at the cessation  of subduction and onset of orogen-parallel
              transform motion.
