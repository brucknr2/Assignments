Abstract    :
              The main emphasis of this project is on the evaluation of wavelet              
              transform technique as applied to the analysis of mechanical                   
              transients. Such transients are strong indicators of impending                 
              machine and machine component failure. Transients are signals                  
              which are much smaller in duration than the observation interval,              
              and are non-periodic, non-stationary, and often non-symmetrical.               
              The wavelet transform method is used as a powerful diagnostic                  
              tool for transient detection and classification. Typical examples              
              include generator arcing, rubbing in journal bearings, and spills              
              in internal combustion-engines. Significant improvements are made              
              in the repeatability of coefficients for modulated transients, in              
              the separability of transients using a mixed probability density               
              function approach, in the detectability using the transform as a               
              matched filter and using artificial neural network, and in the                 
              general performance of approach by automating the classification.              
              In addition, tests are conducted extensively on real data. The                 
              results of this research provide an industrial tool as powerful                
              for the analysis of transients as the spectrum analyzer is for                 
              the analysis of periodic waveforms.*** //
