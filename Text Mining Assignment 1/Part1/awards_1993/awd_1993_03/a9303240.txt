Abstract    :
                   Lind will continue his investigations of the dynamics of                  
              commuting mappings and other topics in symbolic dynamics.  Lind                
              has recently found two invariants of Markov shifts based on                    
              spanning trees.  These will be further studied.  Tuncel plans to               
              continue his study of the structure and classifications of Markov              
              chains and related positivity problems.  Obstructions arising                  
              from periodic points approaching the boundary of the polytope                  
              will be studied with the aim of using the polytope and its faces               
              in an inductive construction.                                                  
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
