Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Human Capital Initiative coordinating committee will organize              
              working groups to prepare specific research initiatives in six                 
              areas of broad national concern.  These areas are productivity in              
              the workplace, schooling and literacy, the aging society, drug and             
              alcohol abuse, health, and violence in America.  The overall plan              
              to focus basic and applied psychological research attention on                 
              these significant problem areas was developed over the past two                
              years through summit meetings of representatives of over 50                    
              behavioral and psychological science organizations.  Each                      
              initiative  will define tangible problems in the real world,                   
              describe current knowledge and provide examples of successful                  
              psychological research relevant to the problems, identify key                  
              issues that can feasibly be investigated and ameliorated within the            
              next decade, and summarize the potential benefits of the proposed              
              research.
