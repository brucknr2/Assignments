Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses the biosynthesis of complex iron-sulfur                
              clusters in nitrogenase.  The formation of these clusters requires             
              participation of multiple accessory proteins, and the function of              
              several of theese proteins, products of the nifS, nifU, and nifM               
              genes, will be investigated.  The nif gene products are all                    
              purified and available.  Proposed studies will determine whether or            
              not nifS catalyzes formation of an enzyme-bound persulfide which is            
              the ultimate S donor in iron-sulfur cluster formation and whether              
              nifU and nifM are involved in iron-insertion.  These studies will              
              require development of a biochemically functional resonstitution               
              system.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters is a poorly understood                
              process whose significance goes well beyond the nitrogenase.  In               
              addition to redox systems, iron-sulfur enzymes are involved in                 
              hydrolytic processes as well as in linking transcription to the                
              cell's redox state or iron loading.  The use of biochemical and                
              genetic approaches to the assembly of the nitrogenase iron-sulfur              
              clusters will be of general importance and will establish a                    
              paradigm for studies of other iron-sulfur and iron-molybdnum                   
              centers.
