Abstract    :
                                                  9303448  Sardar    Research on this grant
              aims to investigate the optical properties  of rare earth ions doped in
              crystalline host materials using the  techniques of laser spectroscopy.  Two
              important neodymium-based  single crystals: YVO4:Nd3+ (1 %) and
              CaMgZnY2Ge3012:Nd3+ (2%)  will be studied initially.  There have been some
              studies on the  first material, but none on the second.  In the final phase of 
              the project,  a more complex, triply-doped material: YAG: Cr3+  (1%), Tm3+
              (5%), Ho3+ (1%) will be investigated.  A complete and  systematic spectroscopic
              investigation of these materials will be  performed, their optical and laser
              properties will be compared  with those of existing laser materials, and  the
              potential of  these materials as lasers will be evaluated.  The measurements 
              will include absorption, emission, and excitation spectra and  fluorescence
              lifetimes at different temperatures.  %%%  These materials have received much
              attention in recent years  since their emission wavelength falls in the 2um
              range, which has  proven to be very attractive for a number of medical
              applications  because of the strong water absorption at this wavelength. The 
              2.1um 5I7 - 5I8 laser transition in Ho3+ is attractive because of  its long
              upper laser level lifetime, of the order of 5 ms,  permitting larger energy
              storage than Nd:YAG, and its eye-safe  wavelength.  Study of the important
              mechanism of energy transfer  from Cr3+ to Tm3+ and finally to Ho3+ in this
              crystal will  provide an excellent educational experience for undergraduates 
              involved in the project; this grant is part of NSF's Research in  Undergraduate
              Institutions(RUI) activity.  The proposed work is  in an area of current
              scientific interest in the field of  photonics, is technologically relevant,
              and has excellent  potential to provide a rewarding educational opportunity for
              the  participating undergraduates who will be exposed to modern  spectroscopic
              equipment, techniques, and theories.  ***
