Abstract    :
              The "Eukaryotic DNA Replication"  meeting will be held                         
              at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory from September 8-12, 1993.                
              This is an annual meeting devoted to fundamental research topics               
              related to chromosome duplication, structure and function, and will            
              include areas of biological research in cell growth, cell cycle                
              control, DNA amplification, virology, and developmental biology.               
              %%%%                                                                           
              This meeting brings together senior and starting investigators who             
              are working in a focused area of research in an environment                    
              conducive to discussion and interactions.
