Abstract    :
              Yang  9303801  Ethylene is a plant hormone regulating many aspects of plant
              growth  and development, and its effects are commercially important in 
              agriculture.  Manipulation of the levels of ethylene in plants,  either by
              increasing or decreasing ethylene production rates, is a  useful option
              applicable to the optimization of many agricultural  systems.  It has been
              established that ethylene is biosynthesized  from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)
              via 1-aminocyclopropane-1-  carboxylic acid (ACC), and the reactions are
              catalyzed by two  unique enzymes, ACC synthase and ACC oxidase.  The aim of the
               present project is to obtain further information about the  mechanism and
              regulation of ethylene biosynthesis which can be used  to establish a
              theoretical basis from  which ethylene production by  crop plants and its
              physiological consequences can be regulated via  biotechnology.  Our primary
              objectives of this proposed project  are: (a) to characterize the nature of the
              rapid turnover of ACC  synthase in plant tissue, (b) to isolate tomato ACC
              synthase genes  that are specifically expressed by auxin application, and to 
              characterize both coding and regulatory sequence regions, (c) to  study the
              correlation between structure and function of ACC  synthase using site-directed
              mutagenesis of amino acid residues  putatively involved in binding the coenzyme
              pyridoxal phosphate,  (d) to further characterize the activation of Acc oxidase
              by Co2  and to identify the activation site of the enzyme, (e) to study the 
              mode of high temperature and chilling stress on the inhibition of  ACC oxidase,
              and (f) to elucidate subcellular localization of ACC  oxidase using gold-immuno
              labeling techniques.  %%%  Ethylene is a plant hormone regulating many aspects
