Abstract    :
              9303524  Langmuir             This is a cruise to dredge igneous rock samples
              from a 2200-km long  section of the Pacific-Antarctic East Pacific Rise between
              35 and  56 degrees south. The work will provide a systematic petrologic 
              comparison between eruptive rocks along straight ridge segments and  those
              obtained both from adjoining overshot ridges constructed on  the floors of
              transform faults and from isolated intra-transform  spreading segments in the
              same transform domains. The work will  also provide samples from a region that
              has not previously been  samples.
