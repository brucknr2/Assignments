                                 9303349 Ricart   The networking project of the Southeastern
              Universities Research Association, SURAnet, is in the process of re engineering
              its topology so that it becomes more economical to connect schools located in
              remote, rural areas.  At the same time quality of service will be improved to
              all connected sites including larger, less remotely located institutions.  This
              growth of connection points will reduce the distance from the new institutions
              to the closest SURAnet backbone point, thus reducing the cost of access lines. 
              The larger number of aggregation points will also reduce congestion and packet
              loss at each aggregation point.  Additionally, they will provide a variety of
              information and support services to assist institutions in defining and
              selecting appropriate hardware and software to establish their own
              institutional TCP/IP local area network (LAN).
