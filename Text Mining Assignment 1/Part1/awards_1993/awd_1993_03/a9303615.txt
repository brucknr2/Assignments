Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from            
              University of Colorado and her Ph.D. research was in the area of               
              plant cell biology.  She plans to carry out her postdoctoral                   
              fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Brian Staskawicz at               
              University of California at Berkeley.  The proposed research                   
              entitled "Molecular and cellular analysis of pathogen resistance"              
              will broaden the training of the Fellow into plant pathology and               
              molecular biology.
