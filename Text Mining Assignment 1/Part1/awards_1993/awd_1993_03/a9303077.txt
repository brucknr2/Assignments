Abstract    :
              Abstract    Bolton  93-03077      It is proposed to upgrade an existing NMR
              spectrometer to a  two-channel spectrometer of more modern design.  The 
              spectrometer will be configured with existing proton  detection probes with X
              channel capability between 15N and  31P and a proton probe.  The upgraded
              spectrometer is  required to be able to perform natural abundance 
              heteronuclear correlation experiments, to perform carbon-  carbon correlation
              experiments at natural abundance, to  perform proton two-dimensional and other
              experiments on  samples in water, to obtain high quality COSY, TOCSY, ROESY 
              and NOESY data for quantitative analysis and to perform  three-dimensional NMR
              experiments.  The upgraded console  will offer significantly greater effective
              sensitivity for  basic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus since the level of 
              artifact signals will be substantially reduced.  The major  value of the
              upgrade is to allow a range of entirely new  experiments to be performed.
