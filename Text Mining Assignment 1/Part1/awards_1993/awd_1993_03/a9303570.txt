Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry                   
              Division is supporting research by Professors De Lucia and                     
              Herbst in high-frequency microwave spectroscopy with emphasis                  
              on the collisional tranfer of rotational energy and the                        
              spectroscopy of molecular ions.  Novel low-temperature                         
              line-broadening studies are underway to lead to increased                      
              understanding of the energy transfer mechanism.  The techniques                
              are also ideally suited to the investigation of the identity                   
              and structure of molecular ions.

              When a beam of gas molecules is rapidly expanded, it cools to                  
              temperatures as low as 1K, giving an opportunity to study a                    
              number of spectroscopic properties uncomplicated by vibrational                
              effects seen at higher temperatures.  An apparatus employing                   
              this effect is being used to study the transfer of energy                      
              between colliding molecules and the structure of molecular ions.
