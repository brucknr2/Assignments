Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Plant Biology.  The applicant received his Ph.D. from            
              University of Wisconsin and his Ph.D. research was on the                      
              biochemistry of plant ubiquitin.  He plans to carry out his                    
              postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Pamela               
              Green at Michigan State University.  The proposed research entitled            
              "Identification and characterization of cis- and trans-acting                  
              factors involved in mRNA stability" will broaden the training of               
              the Fellow into plant molecular biology and nucleic acid                       
              biochemistry.
