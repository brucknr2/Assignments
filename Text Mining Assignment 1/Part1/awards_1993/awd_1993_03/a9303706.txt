Abstract    :
              9303706  Ermentrout       The proposer continues his work on the modelling of
              central  pattern generators with particular application to the lamprey  spinal
              cord.  He collaborates with several physiologists on  modelling of the
              propagation and genesis of electrical activity  in muscular and nervous
              tissues.  Techniques for reducing complex  membrane models to ``connectionist''
              models and the requisite  numerical routines will be developed.  Interactive
              computational  tools for solving of parabolic PDES and integral equations that 
              arise in biological models will also be developed.       The formation of
              regular patterns of muscular contraction  activity is critical in many living
              systems.  This proposal aims  to study the common features of this
              organization.  The rhythmic  waves of contraction as food moves down the small
              intestine, the  small regular changes in diameter of blood vessels, and the 
              regular beating of the heart are all controlled by oscillating  electrical
              activity of cells.  Understanding such patterned  oscillators is critical in
              developing a fundamental understanding  of physiological structures and
              functions.  Moreover,  irregularities in these activities can lead to diseased
              states  and in some cases even death.  Mathematical models of interacting 
              rhythmical units can shed light on how the units normally behave  and interact,
              how irregularities in the units arise, and  sometimes on how to reset them to
              their normal mode.  The  proposer continues his work on such models as well as
              the  development of computational tools to aid in this type of  modeling.  ***
