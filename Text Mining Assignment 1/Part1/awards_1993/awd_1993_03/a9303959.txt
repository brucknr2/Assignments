Abstract    :
              9303959  Kraus       PI will study Eocene and Oligocene alluvial paleosols to
              test  the avulsion model (a new concept of floodplain reconstruction) and  to
              clarify ancient soil/landscape relationships, which are critical  for resolving
              the depositional, climatic and structural histories  of alluvial basins. 
              Because soils are an integral part of the  alluvial landscape, the avulsion
              model also opens new lines of  inquiry into the relationship between floodplain
              reconstruction and  the lateral and vertical distributions of alluvial
              paleosols.  PI  will compare paleosols from two different basinal settings, and
               also from two different climatic settings, in order to elucidate  the
              influences of tectonics, sedimentation rate, and climate on  paleosol
              formation.  ***
