Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program will support work by Drs. James H. Espenson and Andreja                
              Bakac of the Chemistry Department, Iowa State University, on                   
              transition metal-mediated oxidation reactions.  Many of the                    
              studies will explore the superoxochromium(III) ion, which is                   
              quickly formed when Cr(II) reacts with oxygen.  Related aqua                   
              and macrocyclic complexes of Cr, W, and Mo will be                             
              characterized in order to determine the oxygen binding mode.                   
              The mechanism of oxygen self-exchange of the ion will be                       
              determined using radioactive labeling methods.  Oxygen transfer                
              reactions between Ru, Rh, and Cr and other transition metal oxo                
              acceptors will be studied.  In addition, the very rapid                        
              reactions of other low-valent transition metal ions with oxygen                
              will be investigated and the mechanism of those reactions                      
              determined.  Metal-oxo, metal-peroxo, or metal-superoxo                        
              complexes might be expected to be observed as intermediates.                   
              Various reactions of the metal-oxo complexes formed will be                    
              undertaken, including electron transfer and  hydrogen                          
              abstraction.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              In this thorough investigation of the details the interaction                  
              of a number of transition metal ions with oxygen, Espenson and                 
              Bakac will determine the way oxygen binds to the metal, the                    
              rates and pathways by which oxygen is exchanged with other                     
              metals, and the susceptibility of the metal-oxo complexes to                   
              oxidation or reduction.  The fundamental results are expected                  
              to be helpful in understanding the role of transition metals in                
              organic oxidation reactions, which are industrially important,                 
              and of metal-oxo ions in biological systems.
