Abstract    :
              A three-year research program involving nuclear scientists from                
              the University of Dallas, the United States Naval Academy, and                 
              the University of Kentucky is proposed.  This program is designed              
              to include active participation by undergraduate students in the               
              research effort.  The experiments will be conducted at the                     
              University of Kentucky Van de Graff laboratory using the (n,n'y)               
              reaction mechanism.  The focus of this research is the study of                
              mixed-symmetry, or isovector, collective excitations in the N=84               
              and Z=52 vibrational nuclei.  The specific nuclei planned to                   
              study are 142 Ce, 144Nd and 120, 122Te.  Fragmentation of the                  
              quadrupole isovector strength will be explored.  Considerable                  
              spectroscopic information will be ascertained in achieving this                
              goal since M1 and E2 transition rates and E2/M1 multipole mixing               
              ratios are required to interpret the mixed-symmetry character of               
              ollective quadrupole levels.  Transition rates will be determined              
              from nuclear lifetimes measured using the Doppler-shift                        
              attenuation method following inelastic neutron scattering.                     
              Comparisons of our data with theoretical models will be made to                
              obtain a better understanding of the low-lying collective                      
              excitations of these nuclei and their proton-neutron symmetry                  
              properties.
