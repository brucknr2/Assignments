Abstract    :
                   This award will support two postdoctoral associates and a                 
              few short-term visitors and workshops at the Center for Nonlinear              
              Analysis.  The Center's scientific activities emphasize                        
              mathematical research in materials sciences and various aspects                
              of continuum mechanics, phase transitions, composite materials                 
              and microstructures and magnetoscrictive materials.

                   The Center's activities are central to the Advanced                       
              Materials Processing Program initiative.  This award supplements               
              the Center's major funding provided by the Army Research Office.
