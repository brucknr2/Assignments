Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Grant to work in            
              number theory, specifically, the theory of Gauss sums.  Gauss sums             
              are ubiquitous in number theory, playing a role in class field                 
              theory.  The argument of the quadratic Gauss sum was found by Gauss            
              himself in 1805 after a four-year search.  No progress was made on             
              the arguments of cubic Gauss sums for 170 years, when Cassels and              
              Mathews related the argument to elliptic functions.  Professor                 
              Grant proposes to study the argument of quintic Gauss sums using               
              the arithmetic of curves of genus 2.  Specifically, he plans to                
              apply his previous work on the arithmetic of curves of genus 2 and             
              their Jacobians.                                                               
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it hlas become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for              
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
