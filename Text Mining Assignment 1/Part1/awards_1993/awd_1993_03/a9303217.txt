Abstract    :
                   The research area of this project is set theory, in                       
              particular, large cardinals and forcing.  Set theory contains                  
              classical mathematics in the sense that every theorem of                       
              classical mathematics can be formulated as a statement about                   
              sets, and then formally derived from the standard collection ZFC               
              of axioms for set theory.  Beginning with the work of Godel                    
              (1936) and Cohen (1963), set theorists have shown that some                    
              problems on which mathematicians have worked are independent,                  
              i.e. neither provable nor disprovable from ZFC.  Some of these                 
              independent statements are nevertheless known to be provable when              
              ZFC is augmented by axioms asserting the existence of large                    
              infinite cardinal numbers.  The instant project has three parts:               
              first, to continue the study of a class of very large cardinals;               
              second, to continue the study of the relation of these cardinals               
              to problems in groups and finite combinatorics; and third, to                  
              study some unrelated open questions in forcing and infinite                    
              combinatorics.                                                                 
                    The main subject of this project is connected both to set                
              theory and to algebra and topology.  On the algebra/topology                   
              side, one of the topics to be studied is the classical braid                   
              groups, which arise in many contexts, including statistical                    
              mechanics (see for instance Kauffman, New invariants in the                    
              theory of knots, AMS Monthly, March 1988, 195-241).  The                       
              connection of this area with the algebras studied in this project              
              has led to new results about the braid groups.  Moreover, results              
              on the set theory side of the project have opened the question                 
              whether some properties of knots and braids will require the                   
              large cardinal tools of set theory for their solution.
