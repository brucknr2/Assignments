Abstract    :
              9303909  Holm       This award provides one-half the funds required for the 
              purchase of a mineral separation system to be installed and  operated in the
              Department of Geology at Kent State University. The  University is committed to
              providing the remaining funds necessary  for the acquisition.       The
              Principal Investigator and students are involved in  research in tectonics and
              geochronology which requires extensive  use of mineral separates.  ***
