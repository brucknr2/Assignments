Abstract    :
                   This grant is for a conference held yearly at the Aspen                   
              Center since 1985.  This grant speaks to the one week, in                      
              January, when the subject will be "Particle Physics from                       
              Supercolliders to the Planck Scale".  Encompassed within that                  
              broad range will be sessions on high energy physics at present                 
              and future colliders, and recent formal developments in                        
              superstring theory and related fields.  The participants will                  
              be exposed to topics certain to expand beyond their usual set                  
              of professional activities.  This grant's goal is to                           
              "cross-fertilize" the formal and phenomenological communities.
