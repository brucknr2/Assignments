Abstract    :
              9311655  Rahman    Description:  This project is to support an International 
              Symposium on Electrical Energy Systems, to be held in Dhaka,  Bangladesh during
              December 1993.  The purpose is to enhance  interactions among Bangladeshi and
              U.S. scientists, engineers,  and planners with a view to further development of
              an integrated  system approach to electrical energy systems planning and 
              analysis, especially as these apply to developing countries'  conditions.  Six
              speakers are to be supported for travel to Dhaka  to present keynote papers. 
              The focus areas of the presentations  will include: technical and non-technical
              losses of electricity;  system reliability and maintainability; optimum
              generation mix  and fuel diversity; energy management and conservation; and 
              environment sensitive planning.  The sessions will include  presentations made
              by Bangladesh speakers about the electrical  energy sector in that countries,
              its technical problems and  prospects, presentations about utility practices
              and research  tools in developed countries, papers in the five focus areas.  
              Parallel workshops will be held to address the five focus areas,  to be
              followed by general discussions of the working groups'  reports.    Scope:  The
              project deals with an area that is extremely  important to the developing
              countries of the world whose  consumption of electric energy is rising at very
              fast rate, and  whose environmental problems are acute.  The topic is also 
              important to the developed world because of the environmental  impact of
              developments on the world's climate and pollution, and  because of the
              commercial benefits from guided development.  The  scientific issues to be
              discussed and the resulting report should  also be of interest to the U.S.
              scientific community.
