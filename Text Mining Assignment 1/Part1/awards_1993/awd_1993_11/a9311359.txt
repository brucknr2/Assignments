Abstract    :
                   This project provides funds for a planning meeting for Georgia            
              Institute of Technology to determine if it can generate sufficient             
              industrial support to become a collaborative university in                     
              Northwestern University's Industry/University Cooperative Research             
              Center for Engineering Tribology.  Preliminary studies indicate                
              that Georgia Institute of Technology's research and industrial                 
              support would be synergistic and enhance the Center's research base            
              and support.                                                                   
                   Dr. Jorn Larsen-Basse, Program Director of the Surface                    
              Engineering and Tribology Program at NSF recommends the project be             
              funded.                                                                        
                   The Program Director recommends Georgia Institute of                      
              Technology be awarded $10,000 for one year for this planning                   
              meeting.
