Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Japanese has long been known for its elaborate system of                       
              honorific affixes which show respect for the person to whom                    
              or about whom one is speaking.  The researcher will                            
              investigate how honorific use varies in response to                            
              situational features and whether variation in honorific use                    
              correlates with variation in other stylistic markers.                          
              Conventional analyses of Western languages have generally                      
              treated style as involving variation along a single                            
              dimension of formality.  It has been assumed that co-                          
              occurrence rules exist such that speech which is formal in                     
              one dimension (e.g., word order) will be formal in another                     
              (e.g., word choice).  While Japanese honorifics are clearly                    
              related to formality, this investigator hypothesizes that                      
              honorifics are unrelated to other markers of formality.                        
              Therefore, it is possible that Japanese simultaneously show                    
              respect with one stylistic marker while showing intimacy                       
              with another.  This importantly suggests that formality is                     
              not a single dimension, but rather involves several                            
              analytically distinct features which influence different                       
              levels of the linguistic system.
