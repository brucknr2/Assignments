Abstract    :
              9311965  Laub    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
               in advanced computer-aided design tools for robust control  engineering
              between Alan J. Laub of the University of California  at Santa Barbara and
              Pascal Gahinet of the French National  Institute for Research in Computer
              Science and Applied  Mathematics (INRIA) at Rocquencourt.  The objective of
              their  research is to develop efficient, reliable, easy to use software  for
              the design of the next generation of control systems.   Specifically, the U.S.
              and French investigators will combine  their complementary expertise to develop
              state of the art  techniques and tools for robustness analysis and control
              design.    Robust control theory addresses practical control engineering 
              concerns with powerful state-space techniques and offers a  variety of analysis
              and design tools.  The current lack of  reliable, easy to use computer-aided
              design packages is an  obstacle to wider diffusion of robust control techniques
              in  industry.  The proposed research addresses this issue and deals  with
              problems of generic interest to control engineers.  The  results will have
              widespread applications in aeronautical,  chemical, electrical, and optical
              systems, among others.  ***
