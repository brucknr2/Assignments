Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the ultimate aims of "nanostructure engineering" has been               
              to develop structures containing as few as one electron.                       
              Recently, the key difficulties in the last few years in studying               
              the physics of nanostructures have not been in tailoring small                 
              structures; instead they have been in the measurement of the                   
              minuscule signals emanating from a system containing only a few                
              electrons.  In this regard, new technique has been developed for               
              the detection of minute amounts of electrical charge.  This has                
              allowed for a new high resolution spectroscopic tool known as                  
              "Single-Electron Capacitance Spectroscopy" (SECS).  The results                
              so far indicate that this technique should become widely                       
              applicable to the study of few electron systems in                             
              nanostructures, single defects, and single impurity atoms.  The                
              central theme of the work to be conducted here is the development              
              and extension of the SECS method to study a variety of basic                   
              physics and materials problems.                                                
                                                                                             
              A top-loading dilution refrigerator and high field magnet system               
              will be of central utility in these measurements.  The                         
              refrigerator proposed here will allow rapid cooling of samples                 
              and can accommodate a variety of different experiments through                 
              the use of separate measurement probes.
