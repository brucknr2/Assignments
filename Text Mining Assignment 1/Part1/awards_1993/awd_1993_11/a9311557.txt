Abstract    :
              9311557  Barton  Research by Dr. Lawrence Barton of the Chemistry Department, 
              University of Missouri-St. Louis, on metallaboranes is  supported by this award
              in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and  Organometallic Chemistry Program.  Work
              will concentrate on  synthesizing clusters in which more than one bridging
              hydrogen  atom in hexaborane is replaced by a metal-containing moiety.  Using
              cluster expansion methods combined with bromide  elimination from bromoborane
              anions, novel metallaheptaboranes  will be prepared and characterized.  Tin
              derivatives of  pentaborane and hexaborane will be prepared and oligomers of 
              the simple stannylpentaboranes will be synthesized.  Because of  their
              usefulness in organometallic catalysis and their  potential as precursors of
              electronically important materials,  the goal of the project is to extend the
              types of  metallaboranes which can be prepared and determine their  properties.
               %%%  Boron hydrides form in small regular structures, some of which  contain
              5, 6, or 7 boron atoms and an appropriate number of  hydrogens.  While
              compounds in which boron has been exchanged  by a metal atom have been formed
              for other boron hydrides,  metallaboranes have not been investigated
              extensively in these  cases.  Dr. Barton will synthesize and study new metal 
              derivatives of penta- and hexa- boranes.  He will also try to  form chains of
              these species, forming solids which might be  useful ceramics for
              microelectronics.  ***
