Abstract    :
               9311196    Ryan     This project will investigate why animals hatch when they
              hatch, and how the timing of hatching affects their survival.  An amphibian
              species, Agalychnis callidryas, lays its eggs on plants overhanging ponds, and
              the tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch.  Tadpoles are able to hatch
              as early as 5 days old and will do so to escape from egg-eating snakes, if they
              are attacked.  Undisturbed tadpoles, however, usually delay hatching for
              several days.  They continue growing, inside the egg, and when they hatch they
              are less vulnerable to aquatic predators than are the smaller, early-hatching
              tadpoles.  The proposed research examines the effect on survival of
              developmental and behavioral flexibility in hatching, in the context of risks
              facing embryos and tadpoles.    %%%    Many animals live in different
              environments at different stages in their lives, and most animals hatch.  The
              problems facing animals making such changes are general, but in many systems
              only one of the two stages is accessible to study under natural conditions. 
              This study of the effects of changes in hatching time on both the eggs and
              larvae  will add to our understanding of behavior and ecology.  It will also
              provide detailed information on the ecology of this high profile rainforest
              species,  particularly its interactions with its predators at a crucial life
              stage.    ***
