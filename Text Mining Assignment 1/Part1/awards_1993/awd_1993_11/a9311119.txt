Abstract    :
              Research will be carried out utilizing electromagnetic and                     
              electroweak interactions to study nucleons and nuclei.  Primary                
              emphasis is on measuring elementary nucleon form factors,                      
              studying the few-body system with emphasis on the deuteron, and                
              initiating a program of parity violating asymmetry measurements                
              to determine the role of strange quark admixtures to the nucleon               
              ground state.  This research is being undertaken at the Bates                  
              Linear Accelerator Center and CEBAF, with calibration of proton                
              and neutron polarimeters being performed at IUCF and Saclay.                   
              Efforts to be supported include:  (1) commissioning of the Bates               
              recoil proton polarimeter and carrying out an initial                          
              experimental program with this polarimeter; (2) continuation of                
              neutron electric and magnetic form factor measurements at Bates                
              and CEBAF; (3) carrying out a program of d(e,e'p)n polarization                
              transfer measurements as part of the initial Hall A physics                    
              program at CEBAF; (4) beginning an experimental program of parity              
              violation measurements at CEBAF.  The development and                          
              exploitation of new spin physics techniques are major objectives               
              of this program.  William and Mary College will also design and                
              construct the Hall A coincidence trigger using CEBAF equipment                 
              funds and graduate student manpower.
