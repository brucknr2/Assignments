Abstract    :
                                                  9225134  Osgood    Investigations of
              fundamental surface-chemical mechanisms  important in light-enhanced MOCVD (or
              MOMBE) epitaxy of specific  II-VI compound semiconductors will be conducted. 
              The research  will utilize time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and 
              total-internal-reflection infrared spectroscopy as well as a  variety of
              standard UHV surface probes to determine the  as-yet-unknown mechanisms for
              photo-induced reactions on II-VI  surfaces.  In addition, reaction
              cross-sections, yields, and  products will be measured, and in the course of
              these  measurements, consideration will be given to techniques for  proper
              preparation of atomically clean surfaces.  The primary  surfaces for study will
              be those on ZnSe and CdTe.  The study is  expected to give insight into the
              processes initiating reactions  and to guide selection of light-source
              wavelengths, precursor  molecules, and general growth conditions for epitaxy of
              II-VI  materials.  %%%  This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental
               understanding of photo-assisted chemistry on surfaces and its  relation to
              photo-assisted epitaxy of compound semiconductor  materials. From an
              application point of view, the results will  provide guidance for the use of
              lasers and other light sources to  do patterning in an MOCVD epitaxy chamber,
              and will be important  to the general advancement in the technology of II-VI 
              optoelectronics leading to improvements in the performance of  advanced devices
              and integrated circuits used in computing,  information processing, and
              telecommunications.  ***
