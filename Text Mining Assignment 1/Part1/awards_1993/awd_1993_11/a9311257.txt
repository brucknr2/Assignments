Abstract    :
              9311257  Pahwa       Restoration of power after an extended outage in a 
              distribution system results in load much higher than normal load  due to cold
              load pickup.  In addition to initial transients, the  load during cold load
              pickup has an enduring component that can  be 2 to 5 times normal load and may
              last for several hours.  The  enduring component is mainly due to loss of
              diversity in the  cycling type of loads, such as air conditioners, refrigerator
               etc.  An increase in load over a period of time and a trend to  utilize the
              existing facilities to maximum extent will make cold  load pickup and important
              issue in design and operation of  distribution systems.       The proposed
              methodology is a new approach to design and  operation of distribution systems
              to handle cold load pickup  problem.  This research will lay a foundation for
              integration of  distribution automation into the design of a distribution
              system.  ***
