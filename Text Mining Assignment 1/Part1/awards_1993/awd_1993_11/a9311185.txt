Abstract    :
              Menon         This research is on the development and implementation of 
              optimization techniques for multilevel combinational logic  circuits specified
              at the gate level.  Logical implementation  techniques which have been proven
              effective in test pattern  generation are being used for this purpose.  These
              techniques are  being applied to three problems in logic optimization: area 
              reduction, delay reduction, and testability enhancement.   Relationships
              between signal values are being used to identify  common subfunctions without
              generating expressions for them and  putting them in any standard form.  This
              approach is efficient  and could substitute for Boolean factorization in logic 
              optimization.  Techniques for delay reduction involve replacing  segments of
              long paths with shorter ones so that false paths are  not created and
              undetectable faults are identified during delay  reduction.  The effectiveness
              of these techniques as supplements  to an existing synthesis system are being
              investigated.
