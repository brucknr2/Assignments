Abstract    :
              9311803  Anderson  This proposal requests a grant in support of the 19923 Gordon
               Research Conference on Nonlinear Optics and Lasers to be held at  Brewster
              Academy, Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, August 2-6, l993.  As  in previous years,
              the purpose of this conference is to provide an  informal forum for the
              presentation and discussion of new work on  selected topics in nonlinear
              optics, quantum electronic, and  lasers, and their applications to physics and
              chemistry.  An  informal atmosphere with a strong emphasis on discussion is 
              intended to encourage the exchange of ideas in a manner not  possible at
              regular meetings of professional societies.  Particular  effort is made to
              provide an opportunity for graduate student and  postdocs to interact in this
              informal atmosphere with foremost  experts in the field.  A total attendance of
              approximately 135  scientist, including students and postdocs, from
              universities and  industry is anticipated.  It is proposed that the estimated
              total  expenses for the conference of $42,000 be shared by the National 
              Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force  Office of
              Scientific Research, the Army Research Office, and the  Chairman's Special Fund
              of the Gordon Research Conferences.  The  National Science Foundation grant
              will be used to provide partial  support for invited speakers and selected
              junior faculty  postdoctorals and students who, because of limitations of their
              own  source of funding, require financial assistance to attend the  conference.
               No honoraria will be paid.    ***
