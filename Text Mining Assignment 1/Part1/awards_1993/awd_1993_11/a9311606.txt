Abstract    :
              9311606  Grant         The overall goal of this research is to improve
              understanding  of ice formation in clouds.  The specific objectives are:  (1)
              to  obtain ground and aircraft-based measurements of ice nuclei; (2) to 
              quantitatively describe these measurements in a manner suitable for  use by
              numerical cloud models; (3) to adapt these descriptions to  a detailed
              microphysical cloud model; and (4) to compare  simulations with aircraft data.
