Abstract    :
              9311833  Chow   The PI at North Carolina State University and his graduate 
              student will join with a Co-PI from Duke Power Company to  investigate an
              important company problem.  This is to develop an  automated system for the
              identification of distribution fault  causes.  Currently an experienced person
              can do the job.  What is  sought is a neural net realization of that same high
              level skill.   This project is being undertaken under the Engineering Faculty 
              Internship Initiative.  ***
