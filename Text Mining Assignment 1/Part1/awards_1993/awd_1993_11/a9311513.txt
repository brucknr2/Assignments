Abstract    :
                   The research entails investigations into wavelets in                      
              2-dimensions which are free of direction bias, construction of                 
              wavelets on compact subsets via mapping properties, analysis of                
              Burger's equation and applications of wavelet theory to ill-posed              
              problems arising in the theory of integral equations and                       
              statistical inverse problems.
