Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of                    
              Michigan will purchase a high performance liquid chromatograph                 
              (HPLC) that will be dedicated to support research in                           
              engineering.  This instrument will be used to identify,                        
              characterize, and quantify the products from thermal and                       
              oxidative degradation reactions.  The equipment will be used                   
              for several different research projects that investigate                       
              systems in which degradation reactions occur and are                           
              important.  In some cases the degradation reactions are                        
              desired and carried out deliberately, (for example,                            
              destruction of hazardous wastes, conversion of crude oils and                  
              coal to liquid fuels).  In other cases the degradation                         
              reactions are undesired, and engineers and chemists seek means                 
              to prevent or suppress them (for example, deterioration of                     
              automotive engine oils, formation of solids in jet fuel).  The                 
              HPLC will provide access to heretofore unavailable analytical                  
              information that will allow the PI to understand thermal and                   
              oxidative degradation reaction pathways, kinetics, and                         
              mechanisms, more completely.  This analytical instrument will                  
              facilitate advances in several different technological areas,                  
              including employing new approaches for treating hazardous                      
              wastes, developing better liquid lubricants, formulating the                   
              next generation of fuels for jet aircraft, and more                            
              efficiently converting coal and heavy oils into transportation                 
              fuels.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Equipment Grant (REG).
