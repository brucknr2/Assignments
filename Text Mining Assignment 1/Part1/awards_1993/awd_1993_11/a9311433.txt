Abstract    :
              9311433  Dubin    Two aspects of polyelectrolyte-colloid complex formation will
              be  explored:  elucidation of the critical binding phenomenon, and 
              characterization of soluble complexes.  The first theme will be  pursued using
              two types of small colloidal particles of variable  size, and of measurable and
              variable surface charge density:   micelles of DMDAO, and carboxylated
              starburst dendrimers.  The  second matter will be investigated by the
              application of quasi-  elastic light scattering, turbidimetry, dynamic light
              scattering,  and static light scattering to two systems which form soluble 
              complexes:  polycations with mixed anionic/nonionic micelles, and  polycations
              or polyanions with proteins.  These studies will  provide detailed information
              about the solution structure of the  complexes.  For the
              polyelectrolyte-micelle system, they will also  use fluorescence spectroscopy
              and pulsed field gradient nmr, to  elucidate the effect of the polyion on the
              structure and dynamics  of the bound micelle.  In the case of
              polyelectrolyte-protein  complexes, they will make use of computer graphics in
              an attempt to  identify the nature of the polyion-binding site on the protein. 
               Solution characterization of polyelectrolyte-protein complexes will  focus on
              the mechanism of coacervate formation.    The interaction of polyelectrolytes
              with oppositely charged  colloids is a central component in a number of
              commercial processes  and is relevant to some important cellular phenomena.   
              Coacervation carries the potential for the development of new  techniques of
              protein separation and enzyme immobilization.  ***
