Abstract    :
              9311164  Tang  The School of Electrial Engineering at Cornell University will
              purchase an Argon ion laser to be used for the NSF-supported project on
              Femtosecond Optical Sources and Ultrafast  Processes in Semiconductors. 
              Femtosecond of ultrafast and optical techniques have been used with great
              success to study a variety of ultrafast processes in optical materials.  Most
              of these experiments are, however, performed with the Rh6G dye laser around 630
              nm in the visible.  There is a clear need to extend the femtosecond sources to
              the uv and to the ir and to achieve wid tunability.  We have recently succeeded
              in demonstrating for the first time a broadly tunable femtosecond optical
              parametric oscillator (fs OPO) at high pulse repetition rate.  A program of
              research has been proposed to extend the tuning range to cover the entire
              spectrum from approximately 400 nm to 5 um, to thoroughly characterize the
              devices, to evaluate new nonlinear optical crystals for applications in fs OPO,
              and to apply the variety of tunable fs sources developed to the study of
              ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hot carriers in various semiconductor
              materials and structures.  A key piece of equipment for such a project is the
              Argon Ion Laser.  The particular Ar-laser currentyl is use is out dated.  An
              problems originated in the Ar-laser, which is the first in a chain of laser
              sources, are propagated down-stream to the Ti-sapphire laser, the femtosecond
              opticl parametric oscillator, and finally to the experiments on ultrafast
              processes. To asses and to fully realize the potential of this new development,
              it is vitally important that the possible pump  laser source, which ia an Argon
              ion laser, be used.   v       s  t   &   F  ^ &  + ^_MM Õ  M      $
