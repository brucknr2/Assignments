Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal will add a component to a                                        
              research project in Central Asia that is                                       
              currently supported by the Division of                                         
              Atmospheric Sciences.  The PI will determine                                   
              the spatial and temporal variation of the                                      
              chemical content of snow and ice in central                                    
              Asia in order to improve our understanding of                                  
              the distribution of chemical species in the                                    
              atmosphere of this region.  He plans to collect                                
              snow and ice samples within the accumulation                                   
              areas of ten different central Asian glaciers.                                 
              The glacierized regions in the Nepalese                                        
              Himalayas which are extensive and relatively                                   
              free from the chemical influence of desert dust                                
              are an ideal location from which to recover                                    
              high resolution, regional scale glaciochemical                                 
              records detailing the annual variation in the                                  
              strength of the Asian monsoon.  This research                                  
              will be performed in cooperation with the                                      
              Department of Hydrology and Meteorology,

              Nepal. This proposal seeks supplementary funds                                 
              to support field work in Nepal and to support                                  
              the visit of a Nepalese hydrologist to the
