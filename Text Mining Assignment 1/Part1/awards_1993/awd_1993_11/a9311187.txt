Abstract    :
                              9311187  Graham, J.  Research in Marine Biology at the Scripps
              Institution of  Oceanography involves study of the physiology, cell biology, 
              neurobiology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology of  marine
              organisms.  Research facilities are generally excellent,  but the seawater
              aquarium facility in Hubbs Hall is badly in need  of repair and upgrading in
              order to meet the demands of its  multiple users.      This project will assist
              with this essential renovation which  will include the replacement of several
              aquaria and water tables,  replacement of the dilapidated heat exchange system
              now used to  generate insufficient volumes of cool water, and the purchase of 
              a new exchanger to be used in conjunction with a "heated  seawater" supply
              system.  These improvements will enhance local  research and that of visitors
              as well as that of the numerous  other scientific agencies in San Diego
              dependent upon the  seawater system.  ***
