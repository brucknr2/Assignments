Abstract    :
              9311975  Fetterman  A study will be conducted to test at microwave and
              millimeter  wave frequencies several optomechanical media for use in four wave 
              mixing experiments. These media are three-dimensional arrays of  spatially
              fixed, electrically anisotropic particles that are small  compared to the
              radiation wavelength. The particles are  mechanically supported by torsional
              spring on the rigid supporting  frame mounted with two microhinges and can
              undergo rotation due  to electrostrictive torques exerted by incident
              radiation.  Electrostrictive torques rotate the particles in such a way as to
              form  orientational index gratings which can control the attributes of 
              microwave or millimeter wave radiation. The susceptibility  parameters of the
              optomechanical media will be obtained from two-  wave mixing experiments using
              low frequency high-power pump  beams and high frequency low-power probes.
              Four-wave mixing  experiment will be performed to achieve phase conjugation and
              to  evaluate the theoretical predictions of high nonlinear properties of 
              optomechanical arrays. The thrust of this effort will be to  demonstrate the
              feasibility of using orientational properties of  mechanical structures as
              active elements to achieve phase  conjugation in free space at both microwave
              and millimeter wave  frequencies. Combining the concepts of micromachining and 
              millimeter wave devices offers the possibility of entirely new classes  of
              devices and systems. These will have a broad range of possible  applications in
              future communication, power transmission and novel  tracking systems.
