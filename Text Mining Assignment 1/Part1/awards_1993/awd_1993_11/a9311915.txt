Abstract    :
              9311915  Kumar    The primary focus of this research is to understand the 
              practically important question of the miscibility of polymeric  systems from a
              molecular view point.  An argument is made that  the bulk thermodynamics of
              polymeric systems are poorly  understood at this time since they are strongly
              dependent on  local aspects, such as chain structure, stiffness and packing, 
              which are not captured accurately by coarse-grained polymeric  theories. 
              Consequently, computer simulation on realistic chain  models would represent an
              accurate technique to capture the  effects of local structure and unpacking on
              thermodynamics  properties.  In addition to PVT equation of state properties, 
              which can be obtained through standard computer simulation  methods, newly
              proposed techniques will be used to enumerate the  thermodynamic properties,
              especially the phase behavior, of  these systems.    In parallel the effect of
              film thickness on the phase separation  in ultrathin polymer blends films will
              be studied.  It is  emphasized that a good understanding of this fundamentally 
              important physical phenomenon is predicated on understanding,  not only the
              surface behavior of polymeric systems, but also the  bulk thermodynamics.  This
              issue has already been studied in  some detail from a theoretical viewpoint and
              experimental  investigations are currently in progress.  Finally, a good 
              understanding of this situation also requires knowledge of the  steric penalty
              associated with confining molecules near  surfaces, and these aspects will be
              examined through a study of  the alignment of liquid crystalline molecules in
              the vicinity of  flat surfaces.  ***
