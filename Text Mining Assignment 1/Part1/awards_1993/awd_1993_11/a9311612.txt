                          9311612 West  This award will support a cooperative research
              project between Professor John L. West, Liquid Crystal Institute, Kent State
              University, Ohio, and Dr. Shunsuke Kobayashi, Faculty of Technology, Tokyo
              University of Agriculture and Technology in Tokyo.  During a four month visit,
              Professor West will conduct research on surface anchoring and alignment in
              polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLC).  Measurements will be taken of the
              azimuthal anchoring energy as a function of temperature of the eutectic liquid
              crystal mixture E7 at a polyvinylformal surface.  The results will be
              correlated with previous experimental results which show that the electro optic
              response of a PDLC changes abruptly at the glass transition temperature of the
              polymer binder.  The experimental technique will then be expanded to other
              polymer and liquid crystal combinations.  Establishment of a positive
              correlation between the polymer glass transition and azimuthal anchoring energy
              will lead to a wide variety of additional research, such as determining if
              anchoring energy is the cause of observed electro optic variations in PDLC
              materials composed of different polymer binders.  Understanding of the
              mechanism and role of surface anchoring in the electro optics of PDLC materials
              will allow materials to be optimized for a variety of applications such as high
              definition projection and flat panel displays.  Professor Kobayashi is at the
              forefront of liquid cr ystal research, with expertise in the alignment and
              anchoring of liquid crystals at a solid interface.  This specialization coupled
              with Professor West's significant research in PDLC and related composites
              should provide an excellent collaboration that will continue after the
              completion of this phase of the research.  This project is supported by the NSF
              CGP (Center for Global Partnership) Science Fellowship Program.
