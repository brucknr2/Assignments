Abstract    :
                9311455  Cox    The concept of Nash equilibrium (NE) has become central to
              game  theory and to much of modern economics.  It is used to understand  and
              predict a broad range of economic phenomena.  NE is in fact a  rather
              persuasive idea:  Each individual has no incentive to act  differently than the
              NE specifies he will, so long as he believes  that the other participants will
              actually choose the actions the  NE specifies for them.  But the cogency of the
              NE concept depends   upon each player in a game having correct beliefs about
              what the  other players will do.  Several recent papers have developed  models
              in which players learn to play NE -- they learn to have  mutually correct
              beliefs -- through repeated play of a game.   This proposal describes a program
              of experimental research  designed to examine and test some of this recent
              theoretical  work.      One focus of the experimental research will be to
              determine  whether people generally learn to play some NE but not others.   The
              research will therefore potentially both support and refine  the use of NE.  It
              will provide a foundation, for example, for  determining whether an economic
              institution (either an existing  institution, or a newly devised solution to an
              economic problem)  produces desirable outcomes. When as often happens, an 
              institution has multiple Nash equilibria, some of them socially  desirable and
              some not, this research will help to determine  whether people learn to play
              the desirable outcomes or the  undesirable ones.  ***
