Abstract    :
              HONJO  9311199    The scientific team on this project, consisting of researchers
              from  the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oregon State University,  Brown
              University, will conduct a series of field studies during the  Arabian Sea
              Process Study (ASPS) to determine fluxes of particulate  in the water column,
              at the sediment-water interface, and within  the topmost sediments of the
              seafloor.  To measure particle fluxes  in the water column, the team will
              deploy several sediment traps at  various depths at five mooring stations
              located along a transect  from the highly productive western margin of the
              Arabian Sea to the  relatively oligotrophic central basin.  Similarly, to
              measure  depositional fluxes at the seafloor and burial rates, a program of 
              high-quality sediment coring and carbon 14 dating will be conducted  at the
              same five stations.  This work will provide fundamental data  on fluxes within
              the Arabian Sea Study area as well as samples of  trap and coring particulate
              matter useful to other ASPS  investigators.
