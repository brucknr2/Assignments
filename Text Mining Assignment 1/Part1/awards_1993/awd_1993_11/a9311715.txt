Abstract    :
                   This workshop will be the ninth in a series of international              
              conferences on bacteriophage biology.  In earlier years, the                   
              meetings focused on temperate bacteriophages and were devoted to               
              bacteriophage lambda.  The 1993 workshop will focus on                         
              transcription, replication, DNA rearrangements and macromolecular              
              structure.  Genetic engineering continues to rely upon                         
              bacteriophage technology for gene manipulation, DNA sequencing,                
              structural analysis, gene expression and screening.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              This meeting deals with fundamental problems in molecular biology              
              involving bacteriophage and their bacterial hosts.  Progress in                
              understanding these processes at the molecular level has                       
              contributed greatly to the accelerating advances in recombinant DNA            
              research.  New techniques developed in bacteriophage biology                   
              rapidly find their way into the mainstream of recombinant DNA                  
              research and into industrial applications.  Without an ongoing                 
              community actively involved in basic research in phage biology, it             
              is likely that many of these innovations would not have come about.
