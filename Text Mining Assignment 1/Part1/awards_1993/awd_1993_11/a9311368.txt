Abstract    :
              9311368  Phillips    With National Science Foundation support Drs. James
              Phillips and  Bruce Gladfelter will conduct one season of archaeological 
              fieldwork in the Sinai Desert of Egypt. They will carry out small  scale
              excavations at sites which belong to the Ahmarian tradition  and date to
              approximately 30,000 to 35,000 years ago. They will  also focus on associated
              sediments from this period which are  likely to contain pollen and other
              remains permitting fine scale  environmental reconstruction. This work
              constitutes the first  step in a larger scale project in which the team hopes
              to  excavate entire sites to  reconstruct specific activities and to  integrate
              site specific data into a broader environmental  context. The research should
              reveal the underlying subsistence  strategies employed by Ahmarian groups.   
              The Amharian dates to the early Upper Paleolithic period in the  Near East and
              represents one of the earliest cultures uniquely  associated with anatomically
              modern humans. What makes it of  particular interest is its limited areal
              distribution. Dr.  Phillips believes that Amharian peoples developed
              subsistence  strategies which facilitated adaptation to what was a patchy 
              mosaic environment and that group size and movement maximized use  of a wide
              range of areal limited resources. The data he wishes to  collect will allow him
              to examine this hypothesis.    This research is important for several reasons.
              It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also increase
               our understanding of how humans at a simple level of technology  adapted to a
              marginal semi-arid environment.
