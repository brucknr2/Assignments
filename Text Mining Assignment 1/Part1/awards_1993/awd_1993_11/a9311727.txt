Abstract    :
              9311727  Kornfield         This research involves a detailed phylogenetic and 
              biogeographic study of endemic killifishes of Lake Titicaca in  South America. 
              The experimental approach will entail extensive  collecting in the lake
              followed by a detailed genetic analysis of  mitochondrial DNA sequence
              variation within and among species.   These genetic data will be used to both
              construct a phylogeny for  the these endemic fishes and examine population and
              historical  processes related to this unusual diversification in this South 
              American lake.  %%%  This investigation will provide a detailed assessment of
              the  various processes (both biotic and abiotic) responsible for the  diversity
              of endemic (unique) killifishes seen in Lake Titicaca.   Investigations of the
              genetic uniqueness of isolated populations of  killifish will facilitate the
              formulation of conservation policies  optimized for preservation of the biotic
              diversity of this rare and  unusual fish fauna.  This is important as the
              entire Andean  Altiplano ecosystem is becoming threatened by increased human 
              activities.  ***
