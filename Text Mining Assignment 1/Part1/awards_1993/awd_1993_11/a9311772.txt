Abstract    :
              9311772  Batterman    The Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)
              operated by  Cornell University, is a national user facility that provides 
              state of the art high energy X-ray synchrotron radiation to the  scientific
              community.  Experimental studies carried out at CHESS  impact condensed matter
              physics, chemistry, materials science and  engineering, biology, geology, and
              other disciplines. CHESS is a  user oriented facility which accepts proposals
              from all qualified  investigators on a competitive basis.  In addition to
              providing  operating costs, this project supports the development of 
              synchrotron radiation facilities using high photon power levels  provided by
              the Cornell Electron Storage Ring(CESR).  At present,  more than 500
              individuals per year from universities, industries,  and national laboratories,
              conduct research on the 10  experimental stations at CHESS.  Some of these
              stations are  equipped with unprecedented fluxes and brightness.  The facility 
              development program is directed towards equipping these stations  with
              cutting-edge x-ray  optics.  ***
