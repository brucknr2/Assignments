Abstract    :
              9311702  Weide  Zweben  Ogden  This research addresses the technical problems
              impeding the  development of software systems as assemblages of off-the-  shelf
              reusable components.  Substantial progress has been  made in defining component
              engineering principles and in  developing a collection of interoperable
              components.  Each  component is designed for maximal reusability and, before 
              inclusion in a component library, is subjected to quality  control procedures
              by which it is certified to have certain  properties:  correctness with respect
              to a formal  specification, freedom from storage leaks, an essential  level of
              efficiency, etc.  The purpose of a component's  certification is to give
              prospective clients critical  assurance that the component is truly suitable
              for reuse.    The primary goals of the work are to:         *    Identify
              specific properties for which local  certifiability is essential or
              advantageous to the process  of obtaining high-quality software systems from
              high-quality  components.         *    Determine and state precisely those 
              characteristics that a client program and the other  components it employs must
              possess, in order that locally  certified components can be guaranteed to
              behave as  advertised in that client's context.         *    Investigate
              specific techniques for the local  certification of various important
              properties of software.  ***
