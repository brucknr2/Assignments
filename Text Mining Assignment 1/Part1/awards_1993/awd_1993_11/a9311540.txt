Abstract    :
                Gage   9311540    Tropical forest destruction and ecosystem degradation due to
              human modification of the environment is ultimately a function of population
              size and growth.  However, the rates of environmental degradation, and tropical
              deforestation in particular, are mediated by prevailing land use and land
              tenure systems.      This pilot project for a long term multidisciplinary and
              multifaceted study will investigate the factors that underlie tropical
              deforestation in the rural township of Buenos Aires, Costa Rica.  The
              objectives of the current pilot project are two-fold: 1) to evaluate the
              utility of the data currently collected by the C.R. Ministry of Health and
              those housed in local health clinics, and 2) to collect preliminary data
              concerning the agricultural economics and ecology of the region.  The general
              goal is to collect the background information necessary to develop a more
              extensive project concerning the interrelationships of ecology,
              micro-demography, agricultural economics, and tropical deforestation in detail.
