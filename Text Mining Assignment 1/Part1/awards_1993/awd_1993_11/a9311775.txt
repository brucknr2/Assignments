Abstract    :
              9311775  Yuan  Theoretical and experimental studies GaAs optoelectronic devices
              BiCMOS circuits and HBT's will be undertaken.  The optoelectronic device
              research will study GaAs photoconductors and phototransistors, developing
              large-signal and small-signal heterojunction phototransistor and photodiode
              models for optelectronic circuit design.  MEDICI will be used for obtaining
              physical insight into photon and electron properties in GaAs materials, and the
              effect of different light illumination on a number of device parameters will be
              investigated both experimentally and theoretically.    The study of BiCMOS
              research will focus on effects of radiation and scaling on BiCMOS circuit
              performance.  BiCOMS test circuits will be exposed to gamma and neutron
              radiation and post-irradiation performance will be characterized.  A model to
              predict the onset of the 'failure mode' of a BiCMOS inverter circuit will be
              developed.    In the heterojunction bipolar transistor research the theory of
              intermodulation based on device transconductance.  Early voltage heterojunction
              depletion capacitance, and heterojunction diffusion capacitance will be
              studied.  The phase noise of the HBT oscillator will also be studied.  Coupling
              effects of avalanche breakdown, band discontinuity, negative collector current,
              and surface recombination on phase noise will be investigated.  Furthermore,
              the impact of supply voltage scaling on the performance of communication
              circuits like the pager and the transmitter will be examined.  ***
