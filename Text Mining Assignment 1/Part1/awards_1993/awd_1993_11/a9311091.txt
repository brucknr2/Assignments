Abstract    :
              9311091  Wei  This project will study scaling behavior near the metal-insulator 
              transition in the integer quantum Hall effect.  Of interest is  length-scale
              dependent scaling of universality expressed in the  behavior of the fundamental
              critical exponent and the overall  scaling function.  In addition, the
              relatively new regime of  dynamic scaling will be addressed.  The materials
              used in the  project are InxGa1-xAs heterostructures which have short-ranged 
              background potential fluctuations and homogeneous transport  properties. 
              Experimental investigations, involving  magnetotransport and noise
              measurements, will be carried out in the  temperature range from 0.05 K to 100
              K and in magnetic fields to 14  T.   %%%  This project will study the behavior
              of electrons confined to two  dimensions in semiconductor layers, or
              heterostructures.  The  transport properties of these materials turn out to be
              extremely  complicated and require low temperatures and high magnetic fields 
              as tools to sort out the phenomena.  The behavior is of fundamental  interest
              and necessary to test recent theories of the complex  behavior.  The
              semiconductor materials present special  fabrication challenges and the results
              of the experiments are of  technological relevance in materials synthesis and 
              characterization.  ***
