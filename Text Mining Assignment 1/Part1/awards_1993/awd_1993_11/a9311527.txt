              Abstract - Griffin & Maverick - 9311527    Copper metallization is a potential
              new material technology for manufacturing ultra large scale integration (ULSI)
              devices.  Advantages of copper include low resistivity and high resistance to
              electro- and stress-migration.  Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers several
              advantages relative to other deposition methods including the ability to
              achieve good film conformality over high-aspect ratio features (for example,
              trenches and multi-level metallizations).      This project is aimed at
              studying the reactants, mechanisms, and reactor design criteria needed to
              establish low-temperature CVD of copper thin films as a new metallization
              technology of ULSI devices.  The primary goal is to develop quantitative,
              mechanistic rate expressions and reactor transport models of various Cu CVD
              processes.  These models will be applied to analyze experimental growth rates
              for specific CuI and CuII compounds measured using a vertical flow, single
              wafer reactor.  Special attention will be given to product inhibition effects
              at high conversion, to which end kinetic results will be complemented with
              independent studies of ligand adsorption/desorption kinetics on high surface
              area copper powders.  V l     SITEVST 91S           #y     2  ÕHEMADV 91S
