Abstract    :
                   Atomic nuclei are made of neutrons and protons, which                     
              were previously thought to be elementary particles, but are                    
              now known to be themselves made up of quarks.  This                            
              fundamental difference requires a new understanding of how the                 
              neutrons and protons bind to each other to make up nuclei.                     
              The effects of the extended size of nuclear particles have not                 
              yet been taken into account.  The project will apply new                       
              equations in relativistic field theory, taking account of the                  
              particles' size, to analyze data on the processes which bind                   
              nuclei together.
