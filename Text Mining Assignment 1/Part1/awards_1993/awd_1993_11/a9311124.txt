Abstract    :
              9311124  Schatzberg  Dr. Schatzberg is illuminating the nature of technical
              change by  investigating the extent to which ideologies of progress influenced 
              technical choice.  Ideologies can affect technical choice by  shaping
              expectations of future changes.  Assessing the influence of  ideologies of
              progress is only possible through detailed case  studies of technical change. 
              Dr. Schatzberg is extending his prior  work on the role of ideology in the
              choice of airplane materials  and is applying it to two new case studies:   one
              in electric  traction and the other in electric lighting.  In the first study, 
              he is examining the choice between steam and electricity for  streetcars when
              they were both reasonable options for providing  public transportation in and
              between cities.  In the second study,  he is examining the choice between
              electric and gas lighting when  Thomas Edison first tried to convince cities to
              substitute electric  for gas lighting.  The case studies test Dr. Schatzberg's 
              hypothesis on the influence of ideology by examining alternative  explanations,
              based on structural factors, most importantly the  ability of the supplier
              firms to innovate.  The case studies are  primarily American, but his analysis
              is supplemented by comparisons  with European technology.    ***
