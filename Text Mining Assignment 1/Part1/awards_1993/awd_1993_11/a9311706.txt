Abstract    :
              9311706  Lewenstein  This project is designed to begin ongoing discussion and
              debate  about the role of values, especially national and cultural  values, in
              public communication of science and technology.  The  award provides partial
              support for a panel on the subject and for  a roundtable discussion on how to
              include values issues in  education and training for people engaged in public
              communication  of science and technology.  These activities will occur at the 
              meeting on "Science Literacy and the Global Village," sponsored  by the
              International Network on Public Communication of Science  and Technology,
              scheduled for April 21-24, in Montreal, Canada.   This award will enable the
              participation of approximately eight  specialists from developing countries and
              three, including  minority scholars, from the United States.  The panel will be
               asked to address questions of individual rights and communal  goods in
              approaches to communication about science and  technology, and the relation
              between values in journalism and  cultural values.  The roundtable will be
              charged to identify  existing education and training efforts on values and
              public  communication of science and technology, and to consider future 
              initiatives that might be suggested or recommended.  Scientists,  engineers,
              and specialists in public communication about science  and technology in the
              U.S. need exposure to these international  perspectives inorder to prevent
              misunderstandings and to develop  better educational programs in this field. 
              Results are expected  to be published as part of a collection of papers from
              the  meeting and, perhaps, as a special issue of the journal Public 
              Understanding of Science.  The final report to NSF will include  copies of the
              presentations and associated documents.  ***
