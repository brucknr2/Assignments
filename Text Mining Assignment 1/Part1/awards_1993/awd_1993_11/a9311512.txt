Abstract    :
              9311512  Hyden    Technical Narrative:    This proposal represents a
              dissertation  enhancement project to be conducted by Dan  Ottemoeller of the
              University of Florida in  conjunction with his major professor, Dr. Goren 
              Hyden.  This project will use theory from the  study of political institutions
              and political  culture to examine the potential for  democratization in Uganda.
               The study will assess  democratization in Uganda through two mechanisms: 
              first, by the appraisal of a novel institutional  framework, the Ugandan
              Resistance Council system;  and second, by surveying Ugandans for the  presence
              of democratic attitudes.  Project  funding will enable Mr. Ottemoeller to spend
              six  months in Uganda collecting data and coordinating  surveys.  Information
              gathered during this study  will provide a valuable description of the  Ugandan
              polity.    This project in political science fulfills the  program objective of
              advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling a scientist early in his  career to
              conduct fieldwork and collect data in  an international setting in order to
              enhance his  dissertation and develop collaborative linkages  with African
              counterparts.  ***
