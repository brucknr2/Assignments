Abstract    :
              This grant is for the partial support of the 11th International                
              Symposium on the Unification of Analytic, Computational and                    
              Experimental Solution Methodologies (UACEM) to be held during                  
              August 18-20, 1993 at the Sheraton-Tara Conference Center in                   
              Danvers, MA.  The Symposium will provide a forum for the                       
              presentation of state-of-the-art research findings in                          
              micromechanics of materials to an audience of leading active                   
              workers in that field.  This Symposium is the eleventh in a series             
              of such Symposia that started in 1972.  They are held once every               
              two years at different locations, and are attended by eminent                  
              researchers from all over the world.  The gathering of these                   
              individuals at the Symposium will allow for personal interactions              
              that will provide exchange of information and ideas, and the                   
              possible formation of new research groups, in a variety of areas in            
              micromechanics of materials.  Proceedings of the Symposium will be             
              published and will thus be available as an archival resource for               
              future use by the engineering, science and technology communities.
