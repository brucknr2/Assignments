Abstract    :
              9311687  Mishler         This research involves the derivation of a detailed
              phylogeny  of the aquatic fern family Marsileaceae using both morphological 
              and molecular characters.  This phylogeny will be used to examine  the role of
              heterochrony as a means of generating morphological  variation in ferns.  %%% 
              This family of ferns is unique in the development of leaf  structures, and a
              detailed phylogeny will allow one to examine the  details of developmental
              processes associated with leaf  development.  At the same time, the
              developmental information  obtained from this study will serve as a case study
              for a general  evaluation of relationships between developmental processes in 
              ferns and fern phylogenies.  ***
