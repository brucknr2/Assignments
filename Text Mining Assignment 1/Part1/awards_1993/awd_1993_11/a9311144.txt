Abstract    :
              9311144  Focht  This is an award to support research to  determine whether
              complementary catabolic  pathways within bacterial strains for  biodegradation
              of recalcitrant xenobiotic  chemicals such as the polychlorinated  biphenyls
              can be incorporated into a single  pathway by enhancement of genetic exchange 
              between added and indigenous soil bacteria.   Current strategies for combining
              the genes  from two or more catabolic phenotypes  requires isolation of
              parental strains and  genetic manipulation in vitro.  In this  research, the
              investigator plans on adding  the requisite chlorobenzoate utilizer  organisms
              to soil containing indigenous  organisms capable of biodegrading biphenyl 
              alone to determine whether degradation of the  target substrate is enhanced and
              to determine  the relative effectiveness of the different  hybrid strains
              selected and developed during  conduct of this project.    Results of this
              research are expected to  provide insights into how soil and sediments  that
              have been contaminated with  polychlorinated biphenyls can be  decontaminated
              by use of organisms capable of  utilizing these organic compounds as  metabolic
              substrates.  This knowledge may be  utilized in engineering design of
              bioreaction  processes and for in situ decontamination of  soil.
