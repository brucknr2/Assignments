Abstract    :
              9311879  Clore                                ABSTRACT    Across a variety of
              tasks, recent research has shown a  surprisingly consistent tendency for social
              information  processing to be affected by background mood states.  The 
              experience of positive affect appears to foster heuristic  information
              processes (reliance on generalizations, stereotypes,  schemata, expectations,
              but also creative thinking).  Negative  affect leads to more systematic
              processing (attention to detail,  use of analytic thinking and logic).  Several
              explanations for  these effects have been advanced.  This research will examine
              the  social and nonsocial information processing conditions under  which these
              effects occur and test predictions from the major  explanations.  Such new
              information about these pervasive  tendencies promises a clearer picture of the
              processes by which  emotional factors affect everyday thought and action.
