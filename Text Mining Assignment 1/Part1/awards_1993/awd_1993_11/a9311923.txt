Abstract    :
              9311923  Kaufman  The goal of the proposed internship is to develop a systematic
               approach to identifying models of gas turbines from operating  data records. 
              There are data records.  There are two primary  reasons for carrying out system
              identification:         1.  Developing better controllers       2.  Refining
              the physical models    To achieve the first objective, we will try to obtain
              simplified  models that will capture enough details of the system dynamics to 
              enable us to design robust controllers.  The second objective  feeds into a
              larger development project at GE which involves  building better models for the
              gas turbine system .  The results  of the system identification task will help
              in refining the  dynamic and steady state characteristics of the models,
              thereby  improving our understanding of the physical process.    ***
