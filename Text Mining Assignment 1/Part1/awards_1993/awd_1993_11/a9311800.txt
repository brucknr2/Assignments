Abstract    :
              9311800    HALLIMAN  The purpose of  this grant is to conduct analyses of an
              existing  data set collected at the University of Notre Dame on 4,000  students
              who have been followed form the beginning of middle school  through secondary
              school.  Several papers will be prepared  investigating the effects of the
              practice of assigning students to  "tracks" in school on the students level of
              achievement in later  years.  The analysis will examine these effects
              separately for  minority and non-minority students.  The analysis will include 
              measures of mathematics learning and English.
