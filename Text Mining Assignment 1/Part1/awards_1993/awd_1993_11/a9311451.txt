Abstract    :
              9311451  Jeffries       This project will use sub-millimeter solar observations,
               including occultation curves of the extreme solar limb obtained  during total
              eclipses in 1981, 1988, and 1991, to model the solar  chromosphere taking
              account of inhomogeneous structure and  departures from hydrostatic
              equilibrium.  The eclipse observations  cover the wavelength range from 30 to
              1300 microns and were  obtained on the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (1981, 1988)
              and at the  James Clark Maxwell Telescope on July 11, 1991.  The analysis will 
              be carried out using theoretical techniques which we have developed  over the
              past few years, and which will allow the project to apply  the power of LTE
              diagnostics (offered by the continuum at these  wavelengths) to highly
              structured, inhomogeneous chromospheric  models.  The objective is to obtain
              the simplest multicomponent  model which can satisfy the eclipse data and the
              center-to-limb  measurements at these sub-millimeter wavelengths, while
              remaining  consistent with the observed central disk intensities at other 
              wavelengths and with the morphology shown in images of the  different layers of
              the solar atmosphere.  ***
