Abstract    :
              9311813  Achen    Social scientists often use aggregate data to study the
              behavior of  individuals but analysis of aggregates using conventional 
              inferential methods only show relationships among averages.  In  many cases the
              behavior of interest occurs at the level of local  human systems (e.g., farms,
              local governments) or at the level of  the individual human being.  The
              investigator will build and test  a new method for analyzing aggregate data
              that will allow the human  or individual effects to be studied.  This method
              will combine  basic social science knowledge about individual behavior and 
              rigorous derivations of aggregate-level statistical relationships.   The
              resultant models will generate parameters from aggregate data  which can be
              interpreted at the individual or small human systems  level.  The models will
              be developed using historical voting data,  but once developed these techniques
              are sufficiently general to  extend to other domains where only aggregate data
              are available.    ***
