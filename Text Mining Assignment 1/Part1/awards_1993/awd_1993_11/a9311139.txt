Abstract    :
              9311139  Kirkpatrick    Several species of lizards from the South Pacific have
              green  blood. This green coloration is the result of the accumulation of  the
              bile pigment biliverdin. Bile pigments are toxic to virtually  all vertebrates
              producing the pathological condition known as  jaundice. An understanding of
              how these lizards are able to  withstand large concentrations of biliverdin may
              provide insight  into the pathological nature of bile pigments in other 
              vertebrates including humans. This same group of lizards has  evolved several
              different types of adhesive toe pads. These toe  pads are so adhesive that they
              can climb on smooth vertical  surfaces such as glass. By measuring the adhesive
              abilities of  different microstructures for different species we can understand
               the relationship between different morphologies and mechanisms of  adhesion.
              Knowledge of the evolutionary relationships of these  lizards is critical to
              understanding patterns of morphological  and physiological evolution.  ***
