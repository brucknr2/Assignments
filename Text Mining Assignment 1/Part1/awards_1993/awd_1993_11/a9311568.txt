Abstract    :
              9311568  Krevor  This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and 
              Organometallic program, is concerned with the synthesis,  reactivity, solution
              structure and dynamic behavior of di- and  trinuclear platinum complexes that
              contain hydride and/or phosphine  ligands.  Major emphasis is placed on the use
              of two-dimensional  multinuclear NMR spectroscopy for structure elucidation.   
              This proposal deals with fundamental synthetic and structural studies  of
              compounds of platinum and with new uses of nuclear magnetic  resonance as a
              tool for in situ structural elucidation.  The  results of this work may have
              applications in the development of  new industrial catalysts.
