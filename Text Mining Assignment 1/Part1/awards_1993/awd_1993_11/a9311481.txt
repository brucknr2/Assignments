Abstract    :
              9311481  Russell         This research is an investigation of the establishment
              of  photosynthetic endosymbionts in algae.  The symbiotic relationship  between
              the freshwater dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium acidotum, and  the cryptophyte
              Chroomonas will be used as a model system to study:  1) the mode of ingestion
              used by the dinoflagellate; 2) the  alterations of the dinoflagellate membrane
              following the  acquisition of the cryptophyte; and 3) the morphological changes
               occurring in the cryptophyte chloroplast following ingestion.  %%%  There are
              no studies that offer experimental evidence for  adaptations that promote the
              acquisition of chloroplasts in  exchanges involving endosymbionts.  This
              research is one of the  first investigations to examine this acquisition at the
              cellular  level.  The results may provide an explanation for how different 
              divisions of algae obtained their chloroplasts.  ***
