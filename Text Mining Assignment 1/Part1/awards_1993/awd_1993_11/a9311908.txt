Abstract    :
              Wah         This conference, sponsored by the EUROMICRO Association, the  IEEE
              Computer Society, IFIP, AEI, and AICA, focuses on parallel  computing, system
              design methodologies, technology and  implementation within the context of
              application specific  computing.  Application specific computing is directly
              related to  high performance computing and is a major component in this 
              program.  This conference will take place in conjunction with the  IEEE
              International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI  Systems.        
              This grant supports travel by selected graduate students to  permit them to
              attend the conference.
