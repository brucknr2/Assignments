Abstract    :
              9311320  Fader  This award provides partial support for a three-part project to 
              increase the interest, understanding and involvement of  university students in
              science, technology, and society issues.   The project will also promote
              awareness of these issues among  high school students and their teachers.  The
              project parts are  an international conference in the summer of 1994, the
              production  of an issues guidebook for student and teachers, and follow-up 
              with chapter program initiatives on university, college and high  school
              campuses.  The project will begin in fall 1993 with  publicity about the coming
              summer conference and a call for issue  papers for the guidebook.  The papers
              will explore cutting-edge  science and technology issues and their social and
              ethical  ramifications.  The conference will unite selected college  students
              and eminent professionals to explore these issues and  develop the guidebook
              further.  The chapter program will follow  on the conference to continue
              efforts to expand student awareness  and discussion of these critical issues. 
              Oversight of all of  these activities is the responsibility of several boards
              of  advisors.  Evaluation involves statistical recordkeeping as well  as
              qualitative reports about project activities and products.  ***
