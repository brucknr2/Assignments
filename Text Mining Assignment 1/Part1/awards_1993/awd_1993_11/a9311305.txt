Abstract    :
              9311305  HARRIS  This research tests the theory that exclusive water use rights 
              prevent sustainable resource use.  The project examines the  socioeconomic and
              hydrological consequences of a water law enacted  in 1990 to promote
              sustainable groundwater use on Gran Canaria,  Canary Islands, Spain.  The
              research will investigate whether the  water law is accomplishing its purpose,
              or whether it instead is  inadvertently preventing sustainable groundwater use
              by protecting  exclusive rights while imposing monitoring costs and encouraging
               institutional links between water users' associations.  The  investigator will
              collect interview and archival data from two  towns with different ecological,
              hydrological, and social contexts.  The research will make an important
              contribution to scientific  knowledge about the impact of water use laws on
              social behavior and  therefore on the capacity of such a law to bring about a
              desired  result.  ***
