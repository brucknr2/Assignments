Abstract    :
                  9311113  Olson         A central mission of the JGOFS project in the Arabian
               Sea is to determine how efficiently the carbon pump operates  in this region
              and how it responds to changes in physical  forcing.  To approach these
              problems we need to analyze the  structure of the food web and determine how it
              varies with  geographical and temporal gradients in nutrients supply and  water
              column mixing.  The juxtaposition of productive and  oligotrophic oceanic
              systems in the Arabian Sea, and the  regular oscillation between very high and
              low rates of  nutrient supply under relatively constant conditions of  solar
              illumination, offers opportunities for us to gain  insights into food web
              regulation processes.       In this project, Dr. Olson will (1) Characterize
              the  distribution, abundance, and light scatter properties of the  picoplankton
              and nanoplankton at the four intensive stations  and at selected intermediate
              stations, using dual beam flow  cytometry and DNA specific staining to
              distinguish  heterotrophic as well as autotrophic organisms;  (2)  Estimate in
              situ growth rates of specific groups of  phytoplankton, and grazing pressure on
              these groups, from  diel patterns in cell number, light scatter properties and 
              DNA content of individual cells from depth profiles; and (3)  Test the
              hypothesis that the phytoplankton are  physiologically  N-limited during
              non-monsoon periods by  measuring the C:N ratios of phytoplankton ( in
              particular,  coccolithophores and picoplankton) purified by cell sorting. 
              Relative responses of different groups of phytoplankton to N  enrichment will
              be determined from 14C bicarbonate  incubation experiments followed by cell
              sorting to obtain  cell-specific growth rates.
