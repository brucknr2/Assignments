              This U.S.-Former Soviet Union ?FSU! Workshop on                                
              Biogeochemical Processes in the Arabian Sea, will                              
              be held during mid-September, 1993, in the                                     
              Crimea, Ukraine.  Dr. Joel C. Goldman and Dr.                                  
              Hugh D. Livingston, Woods Hole Oceanographic                                   
              Institution, will cooperate with the Marine                                    
              Hydrophysical Institute (MHI) and the Institute                                
              of Biology of the Southern Seas (IBSS), both                                   
              located in Sevastopol.  It has been designed to:                               
              (a) disseminate data and literature from previous                              
              research activities of Former Soviet Union (FSU)                               
              oceanographers in the Arabian Sea, (b) describe                                
              to FSU colleagues the current US and                                           
              International interests in the forthcoming                                     
              Arabian Sea initiatives by JGOFS, NOAA and other                               
              US agencies, (c) provide opportunities for FSU                                 
              scientists to establish scientific contacts with                               
              their US counterparts, and (d) form connections                                
              which might lead to scientific cooperation                                     
              between each other in both the Arabian Sea and                                 
              other ocean areas of mutual interest.  The                                     
              proposed work would be jointly funded by the US                                
              and the two laboratories in Sevastopol.  It would                              
              last five days and involve 17 US and 20-25 FSU                                 
              participants, many of whom have previous research                              
              experience in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean.                                
                                                                                             
              This project in oceanography fulfills the program                              
              objectives of advancing science by enabling                                    
              leading experts in the U.S. and the FSU to                                     
              combine complementary talents and pool research                                
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
