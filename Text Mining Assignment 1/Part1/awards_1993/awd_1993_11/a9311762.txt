Abstract    :
                   This Engineering Faculty Internship focuses on tolerance                  
              inspection of aluminum extrusions used in the space-frames of a new            
              automobile body structure.  The objectives of the project are (1)              
              to develop procedures and algorithms for determination of geometric            
              errors in dimensions and forms of the extrusions and (2) to                    
              characterize the manufacturing process variation in order to                   
              determine the process capability.                                              
                   The result of this collaborative project is expected to                   
              significantly improve the capability of quality assurance for the              
              new automobile structure technology.  A graduate student is also               
              involved in the project.
