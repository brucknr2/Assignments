              mos.    Human-Centered, Intelligent Agents Supporting  Communication and
              Collaboration in Domain-Oriented  Design Environments               This is the
              third year funding of a three-year  continuing award. There is a growing
              awareness among  researchers and users of  computer systems that systems  based
              on a "tool" metaphor do not  scale up to the  information-rich,
              high-functionality systems of the  future.  The goals of this project are (1)
              the  extension of  theoretical and conceptual frameworks and  (2) the design, 
              implementation, and evaluation of  prototype systems in order to  accommodate
              the need for  and to evaluate the contribution of  intelligent agents  for
              supporting communication and collaboration  within  domain-oriented design
              environments.    The proposed  research will explore the embedding of
              intelligent  agents  into domain-oriented design environments with  the goals
              of reducing  the cognitive load on designers  through active behavior, and 
              improving the quality of  the designed artifact.  Agents could, for  instance, 
              help designers avoid overlooking important  possibilities  and settling on
              suboptimal plateaus.  Incorporating intelligent  agents into design raises 
              numerous conceptual, technical, and  social issues.  Technical problems will 
              include user manipulation of  agents through and agent editor,  activation of
              agents  in a shared context, presentation of agents,  and  creation of shared
              context through specification,  construction, task representations, and
              interaction  histories.  Social issues  will include the new role 
              distributions between humans and  computational agents,  namely, the embedding
              of agents in human-  centered  cooperative problem solving systems supporting 
              communication, coordination, and collaboration.  These  issues will  be
              addressed by providing extended task  representations and accountability
              through explanation.
