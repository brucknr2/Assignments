Abstract    :
              9311693  Schadler  A x-ray stress analysis and x-ray tensile facility which will
              be  purchased to support research.  The items include a mini-  tensile test
              device which will be mounted on an existing Siemens  horizontal diffractometer,
              Siemens x-ray stress analysis software  ("Stress AT"), and a computer for
              machine control and data  acquisition.
