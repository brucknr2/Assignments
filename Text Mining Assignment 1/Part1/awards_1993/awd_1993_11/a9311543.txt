Abstract    :
              The principal objective of this exploratory research program                   
              is to develop a new approach for the study of geologically                     
              important amorphous materials such as glasses.  The                            
              methodology involves a combination of high-pressure diamond                    
              anvil techniques and site selective laser spectroscopy.  The                   
              study will utilize synthetic analogues of  common silicates                    
              and aluminosilicates that are doped with low concentrations                    
              of probe ions such as Cr3+ or Eu3+.  The resultant data will                   
              be used to elucidate the pressure-induced changes in the                       
              local coordination environment of these ions and to study                      
              the structural mechanisms of high-pressure amorphization.                      
              Results of the research may ultimately find application in                     
              elucidating the chemical and physical behavior of silicate                     
              melts within the Earth's interior.
