Abstract    :
              Description:  This proposal is for group travel                                
              to the binational workshop on: "Durability of                                  
              Concrete Structures" to be held in                                             
              Bangalore, India, August 26-28.  Professors                                    
              D.V. Reddy of Florida Atlantic University and                                  
              V.S. Parameswaran, of the Indian Concrete                                      
              Institute and the Structural Engineering                                       
              Research Centre, Madras, are the principal                                     
              organizers.  The magnitude of the durability                                   
              problem is of considerable concern to the                                      
              developed and developing countries.  The                                       
              primary objective of this workshop is to                                       
              highlight the most recent advances in the U.S.                                 
              and India, with special focus on reinforced,                                   
              prestressed concrete composites.  Composites                                   
              may be fiber reinforced, ferrocement or polymer                                
              concretes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Scope:  Interaction with Indian engineers                                      
              should be beneficial for U.S. engineers.  The                                  
              concrete industry is highly developed in India                                 
              and quite influential since they provide                                       
              considerable technical support to neighboring                                  
              countries.  This is an excellent opportunity                                   
              for the exchange of ideas and experience with                                  
              engineers at Indian universities and research                                  
              institutes.  The proceedings of the workshop                                   
              will be published.  The India Program                                          
              recommends travel and per diem support for six                                 
              U.S. researchers plus for the publication of                                   
              the workshop proceedings.
