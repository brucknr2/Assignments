Abstract    :
              9311709  Brooks    The evolution of large savanna mammals, such as pigs, horses,
              and  bovids, relates to the human story as both environmental and 
              time/strategraphy indicators.   This proposal will focus on one  of the most
              prevalent large mammals commonly associated with  hominids, the African
              Elephant lineage.     This study will assess the variation in Elephas recki in
              order to  describe the pattern of evolution seen in this fossil lineage,  and
              will examine its utility as an indicator for early hominid  sites.   The goal
              is to study how elephants reflect the long term  response of African ecosystems
              to changing biotic conditions, of  which early human ancestors were a critical
              part.    It will also involve advanced training of a graduate student.  ***
