Abstract    :
              9311927 Liston          This award will allow the Oregon State University
              Herbarium to accept and incorporate an important historical and systematic
              research collection of 123,000 plant sheets that is being orphaned by the
              University of Oregon Herbarium.  A formal collection transfer agreement between
              the Oregon institutions was signed in February, 1993 and follows from
              discussions begun in 1991 when the University of Oregon collections were deemed
              not to fit the long range priorities of its biology department.  The
              consolidation plan involves housing the integrated Oregon collections in mobile
              compactors on one floor of the Oregon State herbarium as well as deaccessioning
              the duplicates (except for types and complementary material)  estimated at
              13,000 specimens  and donating them along with older herbarium cases and
              duplicate books to Boise State University.  The combined collections represent
              an invaluable teaching and research resource representing the flora of Oregon.
              %%% The Oregon State University Herbarium will accept and incorporate an
              important historical and regional research collection of 123,000 plants that is
              being orphaned by the University of Oregon Herbarium because the collection no
              longer fits the long range priorities of its biology department.  The
              integrated Oregon collections will be housed in mobile compactors on one floor
              of the Oregon State herbarium, with unneeded duplicate material, estimated at
              13,000 specimens, donated to Boise State University.  The combined collections
              represent an invaluable teaching and research resource representing the flora
              of Oregon.
