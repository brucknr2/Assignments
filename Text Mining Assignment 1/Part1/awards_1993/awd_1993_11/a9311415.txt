Abstract    :
              9311415  Martin       This project is to produce a video that fulfills three
              needs:   communication, education, and the stimulation of research on the 
              subject of solar prominences.  The central idea is to create a  unique research
              review paper by utilizing the descriptive and  pictorial advantages of video
              format.  The intended audiences are  scientists in astronomical and space
              sciences and their graduate or  undergraduate students.  One of the goals is to
              communicate recent  research discoveries about solar prominences to a wider
              audience  than is usually reached by publishing results only in journals.   The
              broader anticipated audience of scientists would comprise  plasma physicists,
              stellar astronomers, interplanetary and solar  investigators.  A second goal is
              to provide sufficient introductory  and background material to capture the
              interest of these viewers.   A third goal is to present the subject from a
              provocative,  questioning perspective which will stimulate work on key unsolved
               problems about solar prominences.  The creation of this video is  proposed as
              a pilot video because of the potential desirability of  subsequently modifying
              and amplifying the video to appeal to a  wider audience of viewers at in
              college or highschool science  courses or at planetariums.  It is also an
              experiment in using  imagery to review scientific material in a format that is
              both  condensed and easy to mentally assimilate.  ***
