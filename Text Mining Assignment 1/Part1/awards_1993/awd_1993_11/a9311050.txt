Abstract    :
              This award funds U.S. participation in a joint U.S.-European                   
              research planning workshop on invariants in computer vision.  The              
              meeting will be held in the Spring of 1993, at a site to be                    
              determined.  Invariant theory has fueled substantial advances in               
              object recognition, a central problem in computer vision.  There               
              are active research programs studying applications of invariant                
              theory to computer vision, both tn the United States and in the                
              European Community.  The workshop will include research                        
              presentations and discussion sessions intended to identify                     
              important problems and opportunities for research progress.  The               
              meeting should facilitate coordination and communication among the             
              research groups, and is expected to produce a publication in book              
              form, containing both research and tutorial material on the topic.
