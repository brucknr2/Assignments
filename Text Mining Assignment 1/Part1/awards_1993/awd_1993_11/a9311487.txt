Abstract    :
              9311487  Paulsen       This project concerns three main lines of research. 
              First,  developing a Morita theory for operator algebras.  This includes 
              several stable isomorphism theorems and a deeper study of  projective modules
              over operator algebras.  Second, the project  will examine operator space
              geometry and tensor products of  operator spaces.  Third, the project will
              conduct a study of  analytic reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.       This
              research is in the general area of modern analysis and  concerns the structure
              of spaces of operators or transformations.   A fundamental problem in any area
              of mathematics is determining  when two objects are equivalent and their
              geometry is similar.   In this work, the investigators examine the families of 
              transformations on a space and relate these transformations or  operators to
              categories of structures through equivalences.  The  point is that theory known
              for one structure can often be shown  to carry naturally to an equivalent
              structure.  Thus, the  approach is to demonstrate that rather complex families
              of  operators have natural equivalences  ***
