              09/29/93   02:55    Proposal Number:  DMS-9311595    Szarek will continue his
              research in the isomorphic theory of Banach spaces,  mostly `local' and `finite
              dimensional'.  This will include a study of some  problems in the "local"
              operator theory.  Additionally, some "spin-off"  applications of the developed
              techniques to questions in probability, convexity  theory and scientific
              computations will be investigated.  Typical research topics  include:  entropy
              numbers of linear operators, existence of nontrivial linear  operators on
              general Banach spaces, norms of random matrices, `operator' versions  of some
              classical results, and some questions on the border of probability, 
              combinatorics and convexity.  ***    Command ===>  F1=Help  F3=Exit
