Abstract    :
              9311457  Hsu    Large-pore materials have been used in many chemical engineering
               applications such as catalysis, chromatography, ceramic  membranes, adsorption
              and immobilized cell fermentation.  In  each case, the effectiveness of the
              material is believed to be  enhanced by intraparticle forced convection  which
              improves the  intraparticle mass transfer.  Several investigators have 
              presented models of this phenomenon which are intended to  provide methods of
              predicting the performance of these materials  under various operating
              conditions.  However, all of the models  rely on theoretical estimates of the
              intraparticle velocity in  determining the mass transfer rates without
              providing  experimental confirmation.    This project seeks to measure the
              intraparticle velocity versus  pressure drop relationship using a unique
              particle flow  apparatus.  Analysis of the results will provide a quantitative 
              measure of Darcy's constant for the particle.  This constant can  then be used
              in any pressure gradient field, including packed  and fluidized beds, to
              determine the corresponding intraparticle  fluid flow field.  Knowledge of this
              field will allow for the  development of a more comprehensive model of
              intraparticle mass  transfer which includes both diffusion and convection. 
              Such a  model should be  applicable to any type of process which uses  the
              large-pore materials and therefore can be used to determine  their optimum
              operating conditions.  ***
