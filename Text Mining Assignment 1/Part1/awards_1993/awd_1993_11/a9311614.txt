Abstract    :
              9311614  Richardson  This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and 
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, will utilize ion cyclotron  resonance
              spectroscopy for the study of gas phase reactions  between transition metal
              complex ions that have direct solution  analogues.  The primary focus of the
              work is to understand the  effects of solvation on the reactivity of such
              species in the  condensed phase.  Of special interest are electron transfer 
              equilibria of substituted ruthenocenes, the reactivity of Group  4 complexes
              with olefins and alkynes, and the thermochemistry  and spectroscopy of high
              charge, or high mass, ions that are to  be produced by electrospray ionization.
               A new ionization  source will be developed for the latter application, which
              will  involve divalent metal complex ions and small proteins.  %%%  This
              project seeks to understand the ways in which the  interaction of the solvent
              with solutes affects their chemical  reactivity.  The results of these studies
              may be used to  improve industrial polymerization catalysts, improve solar 
              energy conversion devices, and to better understand and control  biological
              processes.  ***
