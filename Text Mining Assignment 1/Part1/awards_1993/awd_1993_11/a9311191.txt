Abstract    :
              9311191  Lesch  The history of biology has traditionally been the history of 
              complex organisms.  By the mid-20th century, however, a radical  shift had
              occurred in the object of study for a significant  component within biology: 
              the object of study became  microorganisms, particularly viruses and bacteria
              rather than the  more complex organisms.  This transformation resulting in the 
              creation of molecular biology revolutionized the whole discipline  of biology. 
              Ms. Susan B. Spath, working under the direction of Dr.  John Lesch, is studying
              one of the sources of this transformation  in the so-called "Delft School" of
              microbiology.  She is focussing  her dissertation research on C. B. van Niel
              (1897-1985), who  brought the "Delft School" ideals to the United States when
              he  became professor at Stanford University's marine biological station  in
              1929.  Van Niel taught for over thirty years a celebrated course  in which
              participated a remarkable number of the major players in  the development of
              molecular biology.  Ms. Spath is assessing the  impact of this course on the
              way biology developed in the critical  period when molecular biology was first
              forming as a distinct  research program.  She is also examining the definitions
              of the  fundamental categories of cellular life as formulated by van Niel  and
              his student and colleague Roger Stanier in 1962.  ***
