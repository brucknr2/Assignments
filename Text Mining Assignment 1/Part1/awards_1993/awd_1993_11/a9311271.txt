Abstract    :
              9311271  DeMeter       The equipment grant is for the manufacture of a best
              fixture  purchase of two program mable power units for clamps and for 
              association computer hardware and software for fixture control and  monitoring.
               The equipment and software will be used in the  development of techniques to
              analyze and control fixture-workpiece  dynamics.  Results from preliminary
              modeling indicated that  fixture-workpiece dynamics could be a source of
              machining error  nearly a magnitude greater than machine repeatability.  This 
              research will focus on the dynamics of workpiece restrained by  small area
              contact and subject to milling.  It will: (1) develop  models to predict the
              impact of element contact surface geometry,  fixture element placement, and
              clamp actuation on machining  accuracy, (2) develop contact surfaces geometries
              which have  superior resistance to slippage, (3 develop models for determining 
              element placement and clamp actuation intensities which will  maximize
              machining accuracy, and (4) investigate variable clamp  actuation as a means of
              reducing workpiece displacement.   Experimentation will  be conducted
              throughout this research in  order to evaluate models and design concepts.     
               The research process can be extended to nearly all fixture  applications and
              measures of machining accuracy.  It will have an  impact on work-holding
              science, process planning science, and the  economics of machining.  In
              addition, it will identify other  research issues in work-holding and process
              planning
