Abstract    :
              Photochemical and photophysical properties of molecules                        
              which react from delocalized and/or multiple excited states                    
              will be studied, with a particular emphasis on evaluating                      
              the relative roles of through-bond and through-space                           
              interactions. In solution, polyfunctional substrates will be                   
              studied, utilizing antenna chromophores or delocalized                         
              excitation to activate distal groups which are transparent                     
              or weakly absorbent in the ultraviolet or are absorbent but                    
              may be selectively activated through the antenna. Special                      
              attention will be given to: (1) charge transfer transmission                   
              through the steroid frame-work, (2) energy transfer in                         
              trifunctional steroids, and (3) the potential role of sigma                    
              bonded relay mechanisms to facilitate virtual orbital                          
              mixing. In the gas-phase, studies will emphasize the newly                     
              discovered Norrish Type II chemistry of thioketones.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Morrison at Purdue University.                    
              Functional groups in molecules will be excited by light                        
              absorption and the mechanism by which this energy is                           
              transferred to other functional groups in molecules will be                    
              studied. A particular concern will be to determine if the                      
              energy is transferred through bonds or through space. In                       
              another phase of the research, unique photochemical and                        
              photophysical properties sulfur containing compounds will be                   
              investigated.
