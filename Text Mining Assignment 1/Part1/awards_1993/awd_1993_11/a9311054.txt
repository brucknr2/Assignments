Abstract    :
              9311054  Jacobson         Cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the most abundant
              peptides  found in the mammalian central nervous system.  It appears to 
              modulate many centrally controlled functions, including  respiration,
              thermoregulation, reproduction, nociception, anxiety,  and memory.  By far the
              best-known role of CCK, however, is its  action as a feeding satiety factor. 
              Recently, Dr. Jacobson found  CCK receptor binding in the facial motor nucleus,
              a substrate that  mediates facial movement or expression, including nursing.  
              Therefore, Dr. Jacobson speculates that CCK may also have a central  effect on
              motor systems involved in the control of feeding-related  behaviors.  Utilizing
              the methods of immunohistochemistry and  receptor autoradiography, she will
              determine if the  cholecystokininergic system is playing a role in nursing
              behavior.   Dr. Jacobson will compare the distribution of CCK receptors in 
              neurons located within the Vllm nucleus which innervates facial  muscles in
              neonates of different species.  She will then use a  metabolic marker to
              determine how manipulations in feeding, and the  exogenous administration of
              CCK or its antagonists, affect the  activity of neurons in developing motor
              systems.  The results from  these studies will further our knowledge on the
              central mediation  of feeding behavior, and the role of cholecystokininergic
              system in  this process.  Understanding this fundamental mechanism could in 
              turn have beneficial effects on management of obesity and eating  disorders.
