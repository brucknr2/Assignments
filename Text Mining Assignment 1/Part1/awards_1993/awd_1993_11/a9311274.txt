Abstract    :
              9311274 Kuga The Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of
              Washington will purchase millimeter wave (MMW) equipment which will be
              dedicated to support interdisciplinary research in engineering.  The equipment
              will be used for several projects, including (i) bistatic scattering from rough
              surfaces, (ii) localization of MMW in disordered media, (iii) coherent
              reflectivity of densely distributed particles, and (iv) characterization of
              composite materials and photon gap materials. Under NSF sponsorship, we have
              been conducting extensive experimental, numerical and theoretical studies on
              wave propagation and scattering in disordered media.  These studies have
              potential applications in many engineering problems including localization of
              waves, photon gap materials, remote sensing and monitoring of environments,
              communications, imaging of biological media, and characterization of composite
              materials.  Our main objective is to understand the interactions of waves with
              random or inhomogeneous media with the aim of applying the results to various
              engineering problems.  We have emphasized the importance of combining
              analytical studies, controlled experiments, and numerical simulations. 
              However, our MMW experiments are inadequate for our present and future studies
              because of the limited bandwidth available.  The proposed wide band MMW will
              significantly expand the scope of our research to include short pulses in
              disordered media and material characterizations. ***
