Abstract    :
              This Engineering Research Equipment grant will partially fund the              
              purchase of a tensile testing system that can be used for small                
              samples, including tissues and synthetic replacements for                      
              biological tissues.  The system that is presently available is                 
              intended to be used with large samples.  The device that will be               
              purchased will benefit the research of a number of investigators               
              working in the biomaterials field.  The projects that will make                
              use of the equipment include: 1) the enhancement of boundary                   
              lubrication for artificial cartilage; 2) effect of joint                       
              inflammation treatment on cartilage mechanics; 3) use of fibers                
              and fabrics to increase the fatigue strength of elastomeric                    
              materials; and 4) viable composite grafts for the repair of                    
              articular focal defects.
