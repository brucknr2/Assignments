Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern                        
              University in the purchase of an upgrade for a 400 MHz,                        
              multinuclear, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.                   
              This upgrade will enhance greatly research in a number of areas                
              including the following:                                                       
                                                                                             
              1)  Early transition and f-element based homogeneous catalysis,                
              2)  Silicon and tin chemistry,                                                 
              3)  High field NMR in cluster chemistry and solid electrolytes,                
              4)  Transition metal complexes with redox-active hemilabile                    
              ligands,                                                                       
              5)  Chemistry of soluble metal selenides and tellurides,                       
              6)  Bioinorganic chemistry,                                                    
              7)  group IV reagents in organic synthesis.  Tin-119 NMR                       
              studies.                                                                       
              8)  Mechanism studies of enzymes and enzyme inactivators,                      
              9)  Donor-spacer-acceptor complexes and functionalized                         
              quantum-confined semiconducting particles.

              A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to                     
              obtain information about molecular structure (what types of                    
              carbon and/or hydrogen atoms and/or hetero-atoms are present,                  
              what are the relative number of each type of atoms and how are                 
              they connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular                   
              dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the molecule                    
              moving).  This instrument is essential for any meaningful,                     
              modern synthetic chemistry research program.
