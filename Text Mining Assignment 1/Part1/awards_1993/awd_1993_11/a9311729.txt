Abstract    :
              9311729  Fisher  Michael Fisher is jointly supported by a grant from  the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry and the Materials Theory Programs to
              continue his theoretical research in  statistical mechanics and the study of
              ordered states of matter, phase transitions between these states, and related
              critical phenomena.  The aim is to elucidate observed physical behavior,
              uncovering general principles and applying them to specific cases.  A variety
              of theoretical techniques will be utilized including phenomenological,
              thermodynamic and scaling analyses, renormalization group methods, Monte Carlo
              simulations, exact mathematical solutions of model statistical mechanical
              systems, and series expansions for singular thermodynamic correlation
              properties and their extrapolation.   %%%  Significant progress in the
              production of new materials has been aided in recent years by a detailed
              molecular level understanding of the interactions which occur in condensed
              phases and at interfaces between solids and liquids.  Fisher's research seeks
              to find theoretical explanations for phenomena such as interfacial tension,
              wetting, the behavior of vesicles and membranes, and phase separations.
