Abstract    :
              9311659  Roytburd       The PI will continue research in applied analysis and 
              scientific computing related to nonlinear wave propagation.  The  work will
              include:  i) The nonlinear evolution of low-frequency  instabilities of
              detonation waves and an asymptotic theory for  the phenomenon of detonation
              waves propagating along a  cylindrical tube;  ii)  The study of a class of free
              boundary  (free interface) problems which arise naturally as simplified  
              conceptual models of gasless combustion and fast solidification.  These free
              boundary problems demonstrate a variety of dynamical  patterns that are
              essentially low-dimensional.  The qualitative  behavior of these model problems
              and their connections with the  front motion description will be investigated
              both analytically  and numerically.  %%%       The proposed theoretical
              investigation will contribute to a  better understanding of a number of
              engineering problems that  include: the design and safe use of highly energetic
              propellants;  safe handling of explosives; the process of synthesizing of 
              certain ceramic and metallic alloys via solid combustion;  explosive
              solidification of thin films and others.  On the other  hand, the mathematical
              models that the PI proposes to investigate  appear to be generic and are
              encountered as simple building  blocks also in other contexts.  Their
              investigation will lead to  progress in dynamical systems theory.  ***
