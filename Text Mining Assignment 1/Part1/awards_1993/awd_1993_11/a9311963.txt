Abstract    :
              9311963  Strand    Funds are provided to defray costs of young scientists and 
              invited participants to attend the 1993 Summer Neuropeptide  Conference to be
              held on June 20-24, 1993 at Edgartown,  Massachusetts.  The field of
              neuropeptides have burgeoned over  the past ten years.  This meeting will bring
              together outstanding  scientists from all areas of neuropeptide research to
              present  state-of-the art lectures in sessions devoted to (1) molecular 
              biology of recently-cloned neuropeptide receptors; (2)  biochemistry of peptide
              processing enzymes; (3) pharmacology and  molecular biology of its receptors;
              and (4) neuropeptide release.   The final session is devoted to strategies for
              the development of  neuropeptide-bases therapeutics which will examine how
              basic  fundamental research may eventually contribute to treatments of  some
              major neurodegenerative disorders.  These are fundamentally  important
              questions in an field that is rapidly advancing and  changing.  Moreover, this
              conference offers an informal setting  for interactions of some of the most
              brilliant investigators with  young scientists.    ***
