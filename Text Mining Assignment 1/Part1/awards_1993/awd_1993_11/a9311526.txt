Abstract    :
              9311526  Jurik    Dicranopteris linearis, a fern, is one of the most
              wide-ranging species in  the Old World tropics.  This weedy, understory species
              is capable of  colonizing severely disturbed habitats such as landslides and
              lava flows,  but also can dominate late-successional forests and plantations.  
              Preliminary studies on Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii, indicate that this fern  has
              impacts on forest productivity and nutrient cycling that are 
              disproportionately large, relative to the fern's size.  The physiological 
              mechanisms and morphological attributes that enable this species to  dominate
              many sites, and that limit its appearance on other sites, will be  explored and
              related to broader scale community and ecosystem  patterns of plant
              productivity and nutrient cycling.  The integration of  these various
              perspectives yields an unprecedented opportunity to  elucidate some of the
              plant-level mechanisms that control ecosystem-  level processes.  It will be
              possible to test rigorously the effect of  temperature on this fern's
              physiology, growth and dominance and to  relate these responses to community
              and ecosystem-level dynamics.  %%%  The study of Dicranopteris linearis along a
              gradient of sites that vary  primarily in temperature also provides an
              opportunity to relate the  warming effect of global climate change to
              vegetational patterns and  processes.  The study of how leaf-level processes in
              Dicranopteris are  linked to community-dominance patterns and ecosystem-level
              processes  along a temperature gradient will increase our understanding of how 
              species, communities and ecosystems may respond to global climate  change.  ***
