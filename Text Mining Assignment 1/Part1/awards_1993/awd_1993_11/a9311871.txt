Abstract    :
              9311871  Eisenberger  Grazing incidence synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques
              will be  used to investigate the adsorption on long-chain thiol alkyls onto 
              metal substrates.  Adsorption will occur from solution and from the  vapor
              phase.  A comparison of the two processes, their kinetics,  and surface defect
              formation will be determined by the x-ray  structure experiments.  The results
              will be of fundamental interest  for surface science, will provide new
              information about the self-  assembly of molecules on surfaces, and will
              provide technologically  relevant information about metal-organo interfaces. 
              %%%  The project will use intense x-rays from a synchrotron radiation  source
              to examine the structure of monomolecular films of long-  chain molecules
              similar to fatty acids.  The molecules adsorb  and chemically bond to metal
              surfaces and "self-organize" to form  islands and eventually two-dimensional
              crystal lattices.  The  dynamics of island formation, crystal growth, defect
              formation, and  other aspects of the monolayer films are only poorly
              understood.   The structure studies will provide fundamental information about 
              the self-organization of molecules in films and will provide  technologically
              relevant information about the metal-oganic  interface.  ***
