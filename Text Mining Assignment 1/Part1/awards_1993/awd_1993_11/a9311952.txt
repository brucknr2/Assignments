Abstract    :
              9311952  Chafetz    Technical Narrative:    This project represents a
              collaborative research  effort between the University of Houston and the 
              University of Fes, Morocco.  The project will  focus on newly discovered
              travertine deposits in  Morocco.  Travertine is a limestone that forms at  the
              surface from spring waters due to biotic and  abiotic processes.  The
              investigators (Drs. H.  Chafetz from the University of Houston and B.  Akdim
              from the University of Fes) will conduct  field and laboratory work to
              determine whether  these newly discovered but as yet unstudied  travertine
              deposits display multiple episodes of  formation and whether they are cold or
              hot water  deposits.  By answering these questions, Chafetz  and Akdim will
              evaluate paleoclimatic conditions  as well as provide valuable insights into
              the  origin and diagenesis of travertines.  Project  funding will enable the
              researchers to jointly  conduct fieldwork and to visit each other's  laboratory
              over the course of this three-year  study.    This project in geology and
              paleontology fulfills  the program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge
              by enabling leading experts in the  United States and Morocco to combine 
              complementary talents and conduct research in  areas of strong mutual interest
              and competence.  ***
