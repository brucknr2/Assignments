Abstract    :
                 The traditional subdisciplines of population, community, and                
              ecosystem ecology have long represented separate avenues for research          
              in terrestrial and aquatic ecology. Given the pressing environmental           
              needs of the future, interaction and cooperation between specialists in        
              these subdisciplines becomes imperative. The purpose of this conference        
              will be to focus on the interface between population, community, and           
              ecosystem ecology. The fundamental goal of this conference is to bring         
              together specialists in these subdisciplines to address questions and          
              issues that lie at the interfaces of population, community, and                
              ecosystem ecology. Attendees will be challenged to expand their                
              thinking beyond their own subdisciplines to encourage integration and          
              development of new research. Proceedings will be published in book             
              form.                                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              This conference is an important, timely, and cost-effective forum for          
              discussion and dissemination of information on the integration of these        
              subdisciplines.
