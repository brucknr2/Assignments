Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 1991 airlift of 15,000 Ethiopian Jews to Tel Aviv                          
              presents a remarkable opportunity to study the impact of                       
              social change on women's reproductive careers.  In Ethiopia                    
              Jewish women married young, bore children early, and had                       
              high fertility, trends opposite of Israeli Jewish women.                       
              This project has two major goals.  The first is to quantify                    
              the effect of changes in economy, education, and opportunity                   
              structure on fertility decisions.  And the second is to                        
              provide a qualitative ethnographic context for understanding                   
              those decisions based on an analysis of women's life                           
              histories.  A restructuring of the life course, as reflected                   
              in marriage and childbearing patters, pursuit of education,                    
              and employment experience, is proposed to account for                          
              differences in fertility regimes between older women who                       
              began their child bearing careers in Ethiopia and younger                      
              women who have begun their child bearing careers in Israel.                    
              The data collected in this study will be generated from a                      
              series of directed and open-ended interviews that will                         
              provide a complete life history of immigrations, residence,                    
              education, employment, and fertility.  The details of the                      
              immigration history of the Ethiopian Jewish population,                        
              including an abrupt rather than a gradual social, economic,                    
              and technical change, provide a unique opportunity to test                     
              hypotheses regarding the factors that influence the                            
              demographic transition.  Thus, this study will provide                         
              critical linkages between social transformation, cultural                      
              values, and individual behaviors pertaining to reproduction                    
              and fertility.
