Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Joint U.S.-Poland Workshop on Quantum Optics                              
              will focus on topics in which both Polish and US                               
              scientists are prominently active and have made                                
              key contributions.  The workshop will provide                                  
              many Polish scientists with new and valuable                                   
              contacts with U.S. researchers, leading to the                                 
              possibility of new collaborative joint projects.                               
              Specifically, they will discuss: (1) atoms in                                  
              strong electromagnetic fields (atomic ionization                               
              and stabilization; high-order harmonics;                                       
              multielectron systems); (2) quantum optical                                    
              approaches to fundamental questions in physics                                 
              (cavity QED; phase operators; micromasers; and                                 
              Schrodinger cats); and (3) chaos and nonlinear                                 
              optics (local field and other dense matter                                     
              effects in nonlinear optics; and conical emission                              
              instabilities).                                                                
                                                                                             
              This workshop in theoretical physics fulfills the                              
              program objectives of advancing science by                                     
              enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland                                
              to combine complementary talents and pool                                      
              research resources in areas of strong mutual                                   
              interest and competence.
