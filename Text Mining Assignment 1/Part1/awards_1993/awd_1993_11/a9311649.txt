Abstract    :
              9311649  NELSON  The proposed research focuses on the experience of women as
              they  integrate into the legal profession.  Two cases are compared: (1)  women
              in large corporate firms, and (2) women in an elite feminist  practice.  This
              comparison will identify social factors in  professional work environments that
              can advance or impede the  interests of women as they advance in status in
              these firms.   Comparisons of women's experiences in male-dominated professionl
               organizations and in an organization where women exercise power and  authority
              will yield knowledge about aspects of organizational  structures, cultures and
              ideologies that contribute to gender  stratification in the legal profession.  
                 In-depth interviews will be employed to elicit narratives about  career
              experiences that reveal professional ideologies,  organizational values and the
              propensity of women to articulate  gender-related needs and interests.  The
              sample includes 50 women  drawn from large firms in a midwestern city and the
              entire  professional staff of a leading women's legal reform organization.  
              The study will contribute to a theoretical framework for the study  of the
              integration of women into the legal profession as well as of  gender dynamics
              within elite professional workplaces.  ***
