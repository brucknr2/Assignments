Abstract    :
              9311425  Formby    This is a joint U.S.-Taiwan workshop on growth, equity, and
              the  distribution of income proposed by Dr. John P. Formby, University  of
              Alabama and Professor Chao-Cheng Mai, Academia Sinica.  The  invited
              participants for this workshop are the top current  researchers in the income
              distribution area.  They plan to  compare data and to discuss studies of growth
              and income  distribution in Taiwan and the U.S.  This is an important and 
              opportune subject as drastic changes in income distribution have  been taking
              place in many developing and developed economies. The  comparison of data on
              earnings distribution between the developed  economy (U.S.) and
              rapidly-developing economies such as Taiwan  can improve our understanding of
              the underlying mechanisms, which  lead to changes in income distribution and
              their relationship to  economic growth.  This workshop is to be held on July
              22-24, 1994  at the East-West Center, Honolulu, Hawaii.
