Abstract    :
              9311930  Hoover  In this project, Professor Hoover is building a bridge between
              the  analysis of causality in the philosophy of science and the practice  of
              macroeconomics and macroeconometrics.   To build this bridge, he  is taking the
              constraints imposed by the nature of macroeconomics  on useful causal analysis
              as seriously as philosophers of science  typically take the constraint imposed
              by quantum mechanics.  A  central theme of the first part of Professor Hoover's
              study is that  probabilistic theories of causality, especially those that rely
              on  assumptions about temporal order, are not adequate for  macroeconomics.  In
              contrast, a counterfactual analysis that  stresses the importance of the
              invariance of economic structures  and the transmission of the effects of
              interventions is more  suitable.  Probabilistic theories have a clear function
              only within  such a structural account.  The second part of the study uses 
              results from the first part to motivate and justify methods of  causal
              inference that are then applied to empirical questions of  causal direction in
              macroeconomics.   The study aims both to  improve applied macroeconomics and to
              provide a richer and more  general philosophical analysis of causality.  ***
