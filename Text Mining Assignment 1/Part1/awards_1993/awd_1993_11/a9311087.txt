Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A system for the characterization of adsorbed species on powder                
              catalysts under operating conditions is being assembled.                       
              Components include a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)                         
              spectrometer, a diffuse reflectance (DRIFTS) attachment, mass                  
              flow controllers, and a temperature controller.  This equipment                
              will be used in several studies, with emphasis on abatement of                 
              nitrogen oxide emissions from stationary power sources.  The                   
              studies include decomposition of nitric oxide and nitrogen                     
              dioxide on manganese oxides, reduction of nitric oxide by                      
              methane ovre lanthana or doped magnesia, and characterization of               
              carbon-supported palladium using adsorbed carbon monoxide.//
