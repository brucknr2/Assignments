Abstract    :
              9311638  Rowlen  This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing 
              Program in support of the research of Professor Kathy Rowlen at  the University
              of Colorado (Boulder). Support is provided by  the Divisions of Chemistry and
              Materials Research. The research  is concerned with the surface morphology and
              optical properties  of thin metal films, specifically silver films. Atomic
              force  microscopy will be used to measure surface features, absorbance  will be
              used to characterize plasmon resonance and surface  enhanced Raman spectroscopy
              will be used as an indirect measure  of non-linear optical properties. Surface
              morphology will be  characterized by the distribution about a mean for particle
               height, width, aspect ratio, and interparticle distance. These  surface
              measurements will be used to test existing theory for  the relationship between
              surface morphology and optical  properties.  %%%  Thin metal films have become
              increasingly important in a  variety of materials areas such as solar cells,
              electronic  components and non-linear optical systems. These studies will 
              elucidate the role of substrate on the surface morphology and  ultimate
              properties of the films.  ***
