Abstract    :
              9311979 Johnson          This award will support drastically needed improvements
              to the bird collection in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of
              California Berkeley, which is one of the nation's largest (173,500 specimens)
              and has important holdings from North America (83%).  The collection is a
              fundamental international and national resource in teaching and research in
              biodiversity and biological disciplines.  The improvements coincide with a move
              of the collections to new, modern facilities in a Life Sciences Building that
              the University has renovated at a cost of $80M $120M.  The renovation has
              achieved a 48% increase in space for all collections.  The support will provide
              cabinets to replace inadequate old cases and to alleviate crowding, two
              ultracold freezers for housing an irreplaceable frozen tissue collection, and
              student assistants for packing and unpacking the collection. %%% The bird
              collection in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California
              Berkeley is internationally recognized in its importance to systematic and
              ecological research.  It is a fundamental resource in biodeversity studies and
              education.  This support will enable the collection to be moved to newly
              renovated facilities and rehoused in modern cabinets that will ensure its
              conservation for future generations of students and researchers. ***
