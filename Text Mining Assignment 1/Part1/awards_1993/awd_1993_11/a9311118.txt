              University of Colorado at Boulder will purchase an Optical Spectrum Analyzer
              with an optical fiber connector input.  The equipment will be used for sever al
              research projects and in the undergraduate and graduate optics laboratory
              courses.  This instrument displays in real time, on an oscilloscope like
              screen, the spectral characteristics of the input optical signal from the
              visible to the infrared region of the spectrum.  It also has a standard
              communications port to transfer data to a printer or computer for printing or
              analysis.  Three research projects will immediately use this instrument: i) a
              multi wavelength, optical communications network; ii) semiconductor laser
              analysis, and iii) rare earth doped semiconductor luminescence.   Experiments
              using the OSA would improve the quality of the laboratory courses by exposing
              the students to state of the art techniques in optical fiber communications.
