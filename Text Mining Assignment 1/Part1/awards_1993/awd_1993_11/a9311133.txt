                  H                H   9311133 Burris This project will assist the Marine
              Biological Laboratory in the acquisition of laboratory and multi user equipment
              that will benefit resident and visi ting scientists and the educational
              program.  A    metabolic gas analysis system    will be acquired consisting of
              two components that will enable the routine, ultra high precision measurement
              carbon dioxide and oxygen in aqueous samples.  The two components of the system
              are 1) a computer controlled dissolved oxygen (DO) titrator, and 2) an ultra
              high precision         K 1     dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) or total      
              CO   2    (TCO   2   ) analyzer.  These instruments will allow precise
              determinations of DO (0.1 uM precision) in sediment pore waters or the water
              column of freshwater, astuarine and marine systems.  Research projects
              benefiting from the acquisition of the metabolic gas analysis system focus on: 
              controls on organic matter production and decomposition in marine and
              freshwater sediments; microbial food webs and trophic structure of lakes,
              rivers, estuaries and the continental shelf; benthic and pelagic carbon and
              nitrogen cycling in arctic lakes and rivers and land margin ecosystems; the
              source and fate of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in aquatic systems;
              and biogeochemical changes occurring in lakes due to increased sulfate
              deposition.  The metabolic gas analysis system will be available to all
              investigators at the MBL and advertised through the widely distributed MBL
              brochures.  A steam autoclave will also be acquired.  The Marine Biological
              Laboratory will make these items available to visiting scientists as well as
              resident scientists.  In a secondary manner, the items may also serve
              educational purposes. ***
