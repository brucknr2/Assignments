Abstract    :
                   The propose work will address two interrelated issues:                    
              undesired plasma based particle generation and plasma created                  
              damage to underlying devices.  Both proposed studies strongly                  
              impact the yield of working die in manufacturing and share the                 
              common issues of a plasma environment.  The initial focus will be              
              in plasma ashing of polymer photoresist which occurs 10 - 15 times             
              in the manufacturing cycle and is therefore leveraged to                       
              productivity.  In-situ plasma conditions as measured by optical                
              methods will be correlated with post-process particle distributions            
              on wafers as well as plasma damage to device structures.                       
                   If successful to results will allow higher yields and greater             
              productivity in the production of semiconductor devices.
