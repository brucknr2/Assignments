Abstract    :
              9313861  Singpurwalla      Techniques for estimating software reliability
              abound.  Over a dozen models exist for estimating software reliability.  Most
              of these models primarily use the failure time and fault data obtained during
              program testing.  Usually these data are used to estimate the parameter of the
              model, and the parameters are then used to estimate the probability of program
              failure during an exposure period.  This probability is widely used in the
              literature as a measure of software reliability.  In contrast to such black-box
              models, white-box models require a knowledge of the program structure.  This
              research seeks to develop and evaluate white-box models that make use of code
              structure and coverage information obtained during module and system or
              sub-system testing, in addition to the failure time and fault data.  ***
