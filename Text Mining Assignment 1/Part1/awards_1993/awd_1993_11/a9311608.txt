Abstract    :
              9311608  Walser  The study of the magnitude and  relaxation time of the optical 
              nonlinear response of organic  materials is essential for two  reasons: to
              determine the  suitability of the optical  nonlinearities for potential 
              applications, and to provide basic  knowledge concerning the mechanisms  of the
              nonlinear optical response.   Conjugated organic systems with  large and fast
              nonlinear  coefficients have recently  attracted to interest of the  electrical
              engineering community  because of their potential  applications in
              optoelectronics,  phase conjugation, dynamic  holography and optical computing.
