Abstract    :
              This proposal, "Parity nonconservation in Atomic  Dysprosium", is for
              observations of parity nonconservation  in atomic Dysprosium, employing the
              methods of atomic beams  and laser optical spectroscopy. The investigator seeks
              to  make quantitative tests of the standard model where  radiative corrections
              are important, and thus to try to  discover new physics beyond the standard
              model. Second, he  seeks to uncover small but interesting secondary effects 
              such as those due to a nuclear anapole moment. Finally,  parity nonconservation
              experiments provide unique tests of  many-body relativistic calculational
              techniques in atomic  theory.
