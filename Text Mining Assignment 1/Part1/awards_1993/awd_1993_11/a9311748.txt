Abstract    :
              9311748  Dry      This grant will be used in modifying and developing editing 
              software for The LINGUIST List.  The LINGUIST List is an Internet  discussion
              forum for academic linguists, which is distributed from  Texas A&M University
              and moderated by Anthony Aristar (Texas A&M)  and Helen Dry (Eastern Michigan
              University).  In its 26 months of  existence it has experienced extremely rapid
              growth in both  subscribers and functions.    LINGUIST provides an
              already-established and fully functional means  of communicating effectively
              with members of the discipline across  the world; and its success demonstrates
              the viability of the  electronic medium as a means of stimulating linguistic
              research.   However, LINGUIST needs to be made more efficient, as its expansion
               has already overburdened its current editorial resources.  If it is  to
              continue, LINGUIST needs to be made more efficient, as its  expansion has
              already overburdened its current editorial resources.   If it is to continue,
              LINGUIST must have editing software that is  easy to learn and designed
              specifically for the intelligent  handling of large volumes of mail.  Part of
              the current project's  budget, then, will be spent in producing software
              specifically  aimed at improving LINGUIST's mail and data handling
              capabilities;  and part will go toward the creation of self-instructional 
              materials (for example, a computer tutorial) for training new  student
              assistants on LINGUIST.  ***
