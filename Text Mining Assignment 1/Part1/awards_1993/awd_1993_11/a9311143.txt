Abstract    :
              9311143  Schlesinger    The proposed research makes use of a rather unusual
              freshwater swamp  ecosystem on the North Carolina coastal plain which is
              flooded and drained twice-  daily due to tidal forcing.  In these forests, the
              flooding regime is essentially  uncoupled from seasonal patterns of soil
              warming.  I propose to monitor the major  cycling pathways for CH4 in situ over
              a one-year period to determine if sources  and sinks respond equally to
              elevated temperatures.  Seasonal studies have rarely  considered both
              production and oxidation of CH4.  The field data will be compared  to the
              temperature response characteristics of methane production and oxidation  as
              determined in the laboratory.  This study will show if the temperature-limited 
              step for oxidation is enzymatic, implying a large increase with soil-warming,
              or O2  diffusion implying a smaller response.  Finally, I propose to determine
              the  potential for CO2-fertilization and elevated temperature to
              synergistically increase  methane flux through increased root productivity and
              root exudation.  Such  positive-feedbacks have important implications for
              modelling trace gas emissions  under various climate change scenarios.  %%% 
              There is legitimate concern that elevated CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere 
              will increase CH4 emissions from wetlands.  Elevated CO2 may stimulated 
              methanogenesis directly by increasing plant production or indirectly by
              increasing  soil temperature.  ***
