Abstract    :
              9311024  Jonakait    It has become increasingly clear over the past few years
              that molecules originally identified as having effects on the growth and
              development of cells in the immune system play similar roles in the nervous
              system.  For example, interferon-g (IFN-g), first described for its anti-viral
              activity in the immune system, has now been shown to affect the development of
              a population of acetylcholine-containing nerve cells in the brain. These nerve
              cells are of particular interest since they subserve functions of learning and
              memory.  In preliminary studies, IFN has been shown to promote the production
              of acetylcholine in cultures of these nerve cells. This project will determine
              whether IFN-g exerts its effect on the survival or the development of these
              cells, whether IFN-g acts directly on the nerve cells or through another cell
              type, whether IFN-g is normally present in developing brain, and whether it is
              normally required for acetylcholine-nerve cell development or survival.  These
              experiments will increase our understanding of factors that control normal
              growth and development of the nervous system.  ***     having eff
