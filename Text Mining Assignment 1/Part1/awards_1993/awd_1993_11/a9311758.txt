Abstract    :
              9311758  Riley  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and 
              Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at  Western Kentucky
              University in the purchase of an upgrade of  their x-ray fluorescence
              spectrometer.  This upgrade will  enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following:    1.  Determination of major, minor, and trace
              elements in the  residues from co-firing refuse-derived fuels with coal.    2. 
              Distribution of major, minor, and  trace elements in animal  digestibility
              studies.    3.  Prediction of fusion temperatures and viscosities of ashes 
              from their elemental composition.    4.  Analysis of major, minor, and trace
              element accumulation in  feed lots.    %%%  The x-ray fluorescence is a
              non-destructive physical method  used for chemical analysis of solids and
              liquids, where the  sample is irradiated by an intense x-ray beam and the lines
              in  the spectrum of the resulting x-ray fluorescence are related to  the
              elements in the sample identified by the wavelength of  their spectral lines,
              and their concentrations are determined  by the intensities of the lines.  ***
