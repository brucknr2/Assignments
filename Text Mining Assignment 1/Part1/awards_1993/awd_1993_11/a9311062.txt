Abstract    :
              9311062 Fainman The goal of this proposal is to conduct basic research towards
              development of the polarization sensitive optical elements for passive
              switching fabric interconnection networks and for packaging of manufacturable
              optoelectronic systems.  We propose to employ the approach of computer
              generated hologram (CGH) design of diffractive optical elements that possess
              two different impulse responses for two orthogonal polarizations.  To obtain
              the dual impulse response functionality we will use two surface relief
              microstructures in birefringent material assembled face to face.  The
              fabrication of these elements will leverage from the advances in the
              microelectronics technology using E beam lithography, photolithography, ion
              beam etching, ion implantation, etc.  The objectives of this proposal include
              modelling, design, fabrication and testing of multilevel phase polarization
              sensitive diffractive optical elements built of naturally birefringent
              materials as well as of artificially birefringent materials obtained with form
              birefringence.  In addition to the optoelectronic systems applications, the
              proposed research advance the basic science and engineering in such areas as
              vector optical wave diffraction on quantized multi level phase birefringent
              boundaries and microstructures, and microfabrication of CGH using deposition
              and ion implantation techniques. ***
