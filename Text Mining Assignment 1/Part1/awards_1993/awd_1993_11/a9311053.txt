Abstract    :
              9311053  Berndt  A LaserSrobeTM Control Vision Inc. equipment for the direct 
              visualization of thermal spray processing will be purchased.  This  equipment
              will be used in projects such as the optimization of the  thermal spray
              process; and analysis of the single-wire,  electromagnetically coalesced, and
              waterstablized plasma (WP, EMCP,  and WSP respectively) forming operations.
