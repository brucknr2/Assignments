Abstract    :
              Lockwood  9311414    This project is a three island comparative study of the
              impact of market integration and capitalist incorporation on rural Tahitian
              women.  The islands, Tubai, Rurutu, and Raivavae differ in their degree of
              development and exhibit a range from minimal to advanced market integration. 
              Women on these islands play different socioeconomic roles and have different
              kinds of control over resources and income; subtle differences in gender
              ideology can also be identified.  The researcher predicts that these
              differences reflect the differential impact of capitalism.  By comparing
              women's roles and patterns of domestic relations (autonomy, decision-making,
              authority) and gender stratification (differential control of income/resources)
              on the three islands, the research will identify the key factors (both
              structural and ideological) linked to the course of change in rural Tahitian
              women' lives.  This research will contribute to our understanding of
              variability in the impact of capitalism on Third World women.  The research
              will be conducted by three anthropologist, each responsible for the major
              portion of research on each island.  Data collection includes a household
              socioeconomic census on each island and extensive structured interviews with
              male and female household heads.  Statistical analysis of the data will be
              conducted and specific hypotheses which relate various gender-based structural
              and ideological factors will be tested.  ***   s( t( of Commerce.  If you need
