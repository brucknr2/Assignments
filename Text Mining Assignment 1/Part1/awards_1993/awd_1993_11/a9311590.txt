Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to study what engineers in                 
              manufacturing actually do.  In addition the study will attempt to              
              better understand what educational experiences would better prepare            
              engineers for their jobs.  The study will document the activities              
              of these engineers so that the information could be utilized by two            
              main groups.  The first will be a group restructuring the                      
              undergraduate engineering curriculum at the university.  The second            
              will be the engineering research center for net shape                          
              manufacturing.  In the latter case there are two main benefits.                
              The first would be to help create a new model for technology                   
              transfer from the center to industry.  Manufacturing problems might            
              be better understood as a result of knowing what engineers in                  
              manufacturing actually do.  The second would be a model for doing              
              research on site at various industrial plant facilities.                       
                   The study will be conducted at a large local company that is              
              engaged in most all major net shape manufacturing processes                    
              involving steel, plastics and aluminum.  This project has the                  
              potential to enhance manufacturing curriculums and the flow of                 
              technology from the university to industry.
