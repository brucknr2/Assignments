Abstract    :
              9311716  Reznikoff  The extensive genetic, physiological and biochemical
              analysis of R.  coli bacteria make this the best defined of all organisms.  It
              is  critical to integrate these bodies of information.  This meeting  will be
              held at the University of Wisconsin on Sept. 9-13, 1993 in  Madison, WI.  We
              will bring together leading researchers in the  analysis of genomes at the
              genetic and sequence level, and will  facilitate the coordination of the
              structural and functional  analysis of this organism's genome.  %%%  The E.
              coli genome analysis efforts are likely to be the first  which will achieve a
              complete sequence determination of a free-  living organism.  ***
