Abstract    :
              9311355       This is a project to investigate the state of the art of 
              manufacturing design in industry in the United States.  It  complements earlier
              studies on design activities in Japan and  Europe which are highly regarded by
              the manufacturing research and  development community.       This is a timely
              effort as it impacts critical issues of  manufacturing and economic
              competitiveness.  Further, it will help  to form the basis from which the
              FCCSET Advanced Manufacturing  Technology (AMT) program can build.
