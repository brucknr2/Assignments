Abstract    :
              9311835  Petrou  We propose a magneto-optical study of the following two
              semiconductor microstructures:    (a)  GaAs/ALAs quantum wells dopes n-type in
              the A1As barriers.  We plan to investigate structures for which th lowest
              conduction subband lies a few meV below the Silicon donors.    (b)  ALAs/ALGaAs
              quantum wells doped n-type in the ALGaAs layers.  We propose to investigate the
              properties of the two-dimensional electron gas confined in the ALAs layers.
