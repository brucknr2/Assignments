Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of synthetic                     
              methods for oligosaccharides that rely on the use of selective                 
              protecting groups. The work couples theoretical studies with                   
              synthetic studies and applies Dr. Fraser-Reid's                                
              "armed/disarmed" methodology to the chemistry of n-pentenyl                    
              glycosides.

              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Bert O. Fraser-Reid of the                      
              Department of Chemistry at Duke University.  Professor                         
              Fraser-Reid will focus his work on the synthesis and theory of                 
              the synthesis of oligosaccharides.  The oligsaccharides are                    
              compounds that can serve as mechanistic probes in the study of                 
              complex carbohydrates, natures most ubiquitous molecules.
