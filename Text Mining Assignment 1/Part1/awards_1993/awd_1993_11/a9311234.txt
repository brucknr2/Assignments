Abstract    :
              9311234  Mathews  This is an award to support acquisition of a  High Performance
              Liquid Chromatograph system.   The investigator plans to use the system in 
              conducting analyses of environmental samples  in research on processes to
              remove organic  contaminants from water and wastewaters and  to concentrate
              chemical compounds of  potential value from waste materials produced  during
              processing of agricultural products  and from industrial operations.    The
              costs of bringing water up to desired  quality standards and in treatment of 
              wastewater to minimize undesirable  environmental impact can be reduced by 
              removal of organic compounds and recovering  their resource values.  The
              equipment  purchased under this award will also  contribute to the education of
              students.  The  proposal leading to this award was submitted  in accord with
              conditions contained in the  Program Announcement and Guidelines,  "Research
              Equipment Grant Program," NSF 90-  146.
