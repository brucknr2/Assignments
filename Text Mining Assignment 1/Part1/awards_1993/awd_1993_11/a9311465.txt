Abstract    :
              9311465  Rovelli       Research in theoretical gravitational physics will be 
              concerned with the use of new variables to describe both  classical and quantum
              phenomena in gravity.  These new variables  give rise to a great simplification
              in obtaining solutions to the  equations of general relativity, and could lead
              to a better  understanding of quantum gravity.  Such an understanding is 
              important in an elucidation of the fundamental forces of nature.  ***
