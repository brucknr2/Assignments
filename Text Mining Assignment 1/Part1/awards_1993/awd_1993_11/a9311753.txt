Abstract    :
                   This research will develop a hypertext maintenance document               
              for the overhaul of a complex unit of balancing equipment.  This               
              type of equipment is central to the manufacture of many different              
              products.  This internship will also help build a closer                       
              relationship between the principal investigator and the industrial             
              research partner.                                                              
                   When complex and/or foreign-made equipment breaks down, a                 
              company is frequently faced with an expensive and time-consuming               
              maintenance problem.  One way to reduce the downtime and to insure             
              uniformity of maintenance procedures is to develop a computerized              
              maintenance document giving step by step diagnostic procedures.                
              This will be the first application of hypertext to a maintenance               
              document.
