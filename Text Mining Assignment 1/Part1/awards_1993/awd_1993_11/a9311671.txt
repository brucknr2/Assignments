Abstract    :
                9311671  Gordon    There is widespread agreement that slow productivity growth
              over  the past two decades is the greatest economic problem faced by  the
              United States.  While the importance of U.S. productivity is  widely
              recognized, economists have as yet made little progress in  understanding the
              phenomenon.  The post-1982 slowdown in the  growth rates of average labor
              productivity and multi-factor  productivity have withstood the efforts of
              economists to provide  a single-cause explanation, including fluctuations of
              energy  prices, inadequate private investment, inadequate infrastructure 
              investment, excessive government regulation, and declining  educational scores.
               While some of these may make a partial  contribution, even when combined they
              appear to leave most of the  slowdown unexplained.  This ongoing research
              project takes a  comprehensive approach to the study of slow U.S. productivity.
                Its focus combines three dimensions - (1) long-run historical,  (2)
              cross-country, and (3) individual industry studies - and  attempts by studying
              these dimensions singly and in combination  to develop an improved degree of
              understanding.      Contrary to conventional wisdom, over the past 120 years 
              productivity growth in the U.S. displays the pattern of "one big  wave," slow
              from 1870 to 1913, rapid from 1913 to 1964 (peaking  in 1928-50), and slow
              again after 1964.  The project attempts to  isolate the industrial sectors
              where the big wave occurs, assess  its statistical accuracy, and develop
              hypotheses to explain it.   The cross-country aspect of the research detailed
              industry-by-  industry data on productivity for other large nations to identify
               the largest differences between the U.S.  It assesses the role of  differing
              measurement methodology in accounting for the  differences.  Finally, a
              detailed industry study will be carried  out for the U.S. construction sector,
              which has exhibited  negative measured productivity growth since the mid-1960s.
