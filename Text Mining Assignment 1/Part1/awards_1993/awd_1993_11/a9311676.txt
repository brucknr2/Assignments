Abstract    :
              The dissertation examines human responses to environmental risks               
              reflected by prehistoric settlement and land-use patterns within               
              the context of changing population densities on Kodiak Island,                 
              Alaska. Site features and locations will be examined in relation               
              to each other and to projected resources. With the combined                    
              advantages of well preserved and highly visible archaeological                 
              sites, ongoing geomorphological and paleoenvironmental                         
              reconstruction and the use of Remote Sensing and GIS, this                     
              research promises to contribute to the anthropological                         
              understanding of culture change and the emergence of complex                   
              hunter-gatherer social systems in the north.
