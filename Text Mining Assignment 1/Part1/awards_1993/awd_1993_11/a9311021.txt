Abstract    :
              9311021  Kellis  This equipment is to be used for  research programs in protein 
              engineering, recombinant cell  engineering, and bioremediation.   Specific
              research topics include:   studies on the mechanisms of protein  folding,
              stabilization and  translocation across membranes;  production of novel enzyme 
              catalysts; amplification and  stabilization of cloned genes; and 
              biodegradation of toxic compounds.  ***
