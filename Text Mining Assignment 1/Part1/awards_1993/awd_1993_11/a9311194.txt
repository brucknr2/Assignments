Abstract    :
                                                9311194  Negahdaripour  Over the last three
              years, this research group has been  working on the development of optical
              sensing methods for  obtaining information about an underwater scene from its 
              images.  This work has led to the development of analytical  solutions to many
              interesting problems on recovering the  shape of motion of objects from their
              images.    This grant provides funds for purchasing necessary equipment  to
              perform high-precision undersea imaging experiments and  for constructing a
              test-bed for implementing optical sensing  methods in an underwater system. 
              These will complement  existing experimental resources for carrying out
              controlled  experiments (based on accurate knowledge of the ground  truth) to
              evaluate the performance of optical sensing  techniques for undersea
              applications.  In particular, the  facility developed under the proposed plan
              will allow:       implementation and testing of the developed methods,    
              verification of various analytical solutions,     detailed analysis of the
              performance of the methods and    error/accuracy evaluation,     comparison of
              the performance and accuracy with the    existing technologies.    These
              equipment are essential for the development and  verification of accurate image
              models and the design of  optical sensing methods for undersea applications.
