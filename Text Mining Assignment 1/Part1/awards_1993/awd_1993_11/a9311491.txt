Abstract    :
              9311491  Rabenold    The investigators will conduct a study of highly social
              brown jays in Costa Rica.  They will employ genetic analyses and trace
              ontogenies to determine the complexity of breeding options available to young
              individuals.  %%%  This research builds on a long-term study of the
              relationship between social behavior and increasing density as this population
              has grown since its inception 30 years ago.  A key element in this society is
              the role played by delayed maturation and the signaling of dominance status. 
              By understanding differential reproductive activity, territory inheritance and
              patterns of dispersal and survival, light will be shed on the "parental
              facilitation" hypotheses.  These hypotheses propose that tolerance by dominants
              by others might under some circumstances by favored.  Study of brown jays as a
              model of social birds, will provide a definitive demonstration of a major, but
              poorly understood, branch of vertebrate sociality.  ***    ofbejays as a model
