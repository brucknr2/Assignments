Abstract    :
                   The award is for an equipment grant to purchase a Q-switched              
              YAG Laser, vibration isolation optical table, and optical mounting             
              devices.  The equipment will be used to support research in the                
              evolving area of laser array generation of ultrasound.  This                   
              technology will be used on-line to control weld quality in real-               
              time, in particular the depth of weld penetration and porosity.                
              Ultrasonics is a promising method for weld quality control because             
              of its ability to penetrate opaque bodies and be reflected at                  
              discontinuities.                                                               
                   The research is expected to yield a significantly more                    
              efficient technique of noncontact laser generation of ultrasound,              
              for nondestructive testing of materials and processes.  The                    
              technique being developed uses an array of laser beams in place of             
              a single laser beam.  A noncontact electromagnetic acoustic                    
              transducer will be used as a receiver.//
