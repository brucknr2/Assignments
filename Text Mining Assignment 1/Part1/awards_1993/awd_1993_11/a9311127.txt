Abstract    :
               Exact combinatorial solutions to the motion planning   problem in  robotics,
              which use precise computational geometry   techniques,  especially for  systems
              with few degrees of freedom, tend to be  more robust   than heuristic or 
              approximating solutions; they can  achieve performance that   is theoretically 
              faster than that of  naive solutions by an order of magnitude   or more, and it
              is  therefore desirable to test their pragmatic feasibility in   real  systems 
              context, both to complete the somewhat abstract algorithm    variants typical
              of  theoretical developments in computational  geometry, and to   show that
              they  indeed perform well in practice.    This project undertakes   the
              development of  an `industrial-strength' motion planning system for bodies  
              translating in  3-dimensional polyhedral environments.  This system utilizes   
              efficient and  precise geometric algorithms obtained through  ongoing  
              theoretical work, whose  worst-case complexity attains the  best theoretical
              bounds   known for the  problem, and also turn out  to be very efficient in
              practice.
