Abstract    :
              9311409  Leith  We propose several methods for imaging through highly scattering
              material, all based on the use of light that is either spatially or temporally
              incoherent, or both.  We propose using for this undertaking a sophisticated
              imaging system, comprising a cooled CCD camera, a computer, and extensive
              software we develped.  In addition, the equipment and the proposed techniques
              are to be developed for a range of other imaging areas, including optical
              sectioning, phase contrast imaging, and a multiple-wavelenght depth contrast
              imaging, and a multiple-wavelength depth contouring.  ***
