Abstract    :
                   Designing with composites has often been based on a "black                
              aluminum" approach.  Some design tolls have been developed to                  
              advance the design of composites in the past decade.  The                      
              manufacturing processes of composites have also been dominated by              
              manual operations.  Nearly all manufacturing methods used today are            
              by batch rather than continuous process.  An Industry/University               
              Cooperative Research Center on Composites at Stanford University               
              could provide a better mechanism to achieve efficiency and economy             
              in material and processes in terms of energy consumption, dual-use             
              technologies, and friendliness to the environment.  The Center will            
              focus on the integrated material and processing technology such as             
              thermoplastic composites and continuous manufacturing processes for            
              low-cost civilian applications.                                                
                   A planning meeting will study if industry will support an                 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Composites                  
              Technology to be headquartered at Stanford University.  The meeting            
              will assess industry interest and determine if the Center has                  
              sufficient support and merit to meet the Industry/University                   
              Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria.  The proposed                   
              research projects will address:  1) computer-based data base for               
              composite design; 2) process research on continuous or fast                    
              consolidation such as pultrusion and thermo-forming; 3) research in            
              methodology of testing, inspection, maintenance, and repair of                 
              composite material; 4) ultrasonic welding of thermoplastics for                
              assembly and repair; 5) design of low-cost glass-thermoplastics                
              tapes for structural composite; 6) design of low-cost stiffened                
              composite panel.                                                               
                   The Principle Investigator is recognized as an eminent                    
              researcher and has the resource for this planning meeting.                     
                   The Program Director recommends Stanford University be awarded            
              $10,000 for three months.
