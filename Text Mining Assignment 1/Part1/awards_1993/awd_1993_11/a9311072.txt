Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, several                  
              workstations will be purchased to help equip a Laboratory for                  
              Computational Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer at the PI's                     
              institution. The research conducted in this laboratory                         
              concerns transition to turbulence in complex geometries, heat                  
              transfer enhancement by flow destabilization, and thermal                      
              issues involved in materials processing.                                       
                                                                                             
              Applications include cooling of electronic equipmentand                        
              turbine blades, as well as thermal processing of materials.
