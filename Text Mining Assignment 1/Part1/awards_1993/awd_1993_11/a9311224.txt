Abstract    :
              Willigen/Suminguit  9311224    In third world economic development circles and
              academia, there is an increasing interest in local knowledge systems (LKS) and
              agroforestry (AF).  However, little is known about the linkages between them
              and the benefits of combining them to improve upland farming systems and to
              slow down deforestation.  This study proposes to examine the linkages between
              LKS and AF (1) by documenting folk taxonomy and traditional management
              practices of trees, food crops, and soils among the Subanun and Visayan farmers
              in the southwestern Philippines; and (2) by comparing the differential
              distribution of this technical knowledge by age, gender, socioeconomic status,
              and ethnicity.    The researcher will use archival research, participant
              observation, informal, and formal interviews to collect primary data.  In
              addition, semantic domain analysis, a linguistic technique,  will be used to
              analyze qualitative data.  This study will enhance of our understanding in the
              linkage of local knowledge systems and agroforestry.  This will also make a
              basic contribution to the study of intracultural variation.  The applied
              significance is its potential contribution to an improved design of
              agroforestry projects that increase food production of the upland farmers and
              forest occupants, while slowing down the process of deforestation.  ***  bert
