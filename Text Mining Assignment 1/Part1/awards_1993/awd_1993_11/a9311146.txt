Abstract    :
              9311146  Schlom  This proposal is for equipment which allow the synthesis of
              custom-made epitaxial heterostructures uniquely suited to investigating
              physical phenomena and testing novel device concepts through the use of a
              controlled film growth environment in which the growth process of oxides may be
              closely monitored and optimized.  The equipment is simple molecular beam
              epitaxy (MBE) machine for the controlled epitaxial growth of oxides.  ***
