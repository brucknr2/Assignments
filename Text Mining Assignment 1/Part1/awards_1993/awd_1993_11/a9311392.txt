Abstract    :
              This proposal is for studying the formation, evolution and                     
              electrodynamic consequences of ionospheric intermediate layers.                
              These regions of enhanced ion concentration that appear in the                 
              bottomside of the nighttime F region can be formed by the action of            
              gravity wave neutral wind fields.  As part of a present graduate               
              student project the non-ExB motion of the ionospheric plasma at                
              altitudes below about 200 km has been successfully incorporated.               
              This physics was added to the previous ionosphere model which                  
              assumed all the plasma on a flux tube was subject only to ExB                  
              drifts perpendicular to the magnetic field.  As a result of this               
              work it is possible to undertake an examination of the formation of            
              intermediate layers that are thought to form as a result of the                
              action of gravity wave neutral wind fields.  In this proposal the              
              ability of propagating neutral wind fields to produce perturbations            
              in the ambient ionospheric profile and the role that non-reactive              
              metallic ions might play in the appearance of these layers at lower            
              altitudes will be examined.
