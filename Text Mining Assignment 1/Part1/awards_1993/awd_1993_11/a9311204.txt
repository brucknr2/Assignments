              requests equipment grant that will complement and improve our  characterization
              and research facility in electro optics, nonlinear optics, and optical
              communication.  The requested instrumentation would cover the dynamic analysis
              and characterization of the studied  effects, devices, and systems. The
              equipment will enable faculty members and students to carry  out meaningful and
              cooperative research in the high speed photonics area. In particular we intend 
              to strengthen and complement existing research activities in the following
              topics:        Composite Cavity Semiconductor Lasers for High Speed
              Communication.      Laterally Coupled Cavity Semiconductor Laser for Widely
              Tunable Single Longitudinal  Mode Operation.      Coupled Periodic Waveguides
              for Integrated Optics Applications.      Quenching of Phase and Amplitude Noise
              Using Spherical Particles Resonance Interaction  with Semiconductor Lasers.
