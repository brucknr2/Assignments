Abstract    :
              9311277  Elgamal  The objective of this research is to fabricate a hydraulically
               consolidation unit to permit consolidation of centrifuge models.  Transducers
              and electronics for monitoring and controlling the  consolidation process will
              be acquired.  A special vacuum-slurry  mixer and high capacity vacuum pump will
              be purchased for mixing  clay slurry under vacuum.  A new strongbox will be
              fabricated for  modeling of phenomena in deep soil layers.  A sand rainer for 
              accurate and repeatable deposition of granular media will be  acquired, and a
              high capacity dust collector will be purchased.  ***
