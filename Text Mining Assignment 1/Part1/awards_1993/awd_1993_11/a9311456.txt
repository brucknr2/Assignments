Abstract    :
              9311456  Bers  This work, which is bases on previous NSF grant ECS-8822475 
              outlines analytical and computational research that aims at  expanding and
              developing the knowledge and technology base of  nonlinear chaotic
              electrodynamics in plasmas-and plasma-like  media.  In particular, the outlined
              work points to new,  fundamental wave interactions.  These have potentially
              important  applications:   the former in the control of charged particle 
              dynamics in systems using magnetized plasma RF-processing  material surfaces,
              and in the understanding of ion acceleration  in the energization of the
              magnetosphere; and the latter in  establishing a new particle transport
              scenario for coherent  (narrow-band) unstable waves, as well as determining the
              limits  and control of long-distance bit-rates in optical communications 
              systems.  ***
