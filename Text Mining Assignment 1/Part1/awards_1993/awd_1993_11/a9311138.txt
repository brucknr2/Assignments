Abstract    :
              9311138 Hallbeck          Cumulative trauma disorders (CTD) of the wrist are a
              common and costly problem in industry.  High force exertions and repetition
              coupled and awkward wrist and  hand  postures are believed to lead to CTD.  The
              levels of these factors and interactions among them are currently unknown. 
              Additionally, most of the research done to date, has focused on static forces. 
                      An isokinetic dynamometer for flexion and extension of the wrist must
              be designed, constructed, and validated to evaluate the main factors of force
              repetition and posture on fatigue or endurance and link them to CTD in workers.
               The isokinetic dynamometer must be developed such that force (torque),
              velocity (repetition), and range of motion (awkward posture) can be  controlled
              with a personal computer for reproducibility of the exertion.  Measurement and
              recording of the dependent variables for either force, torque, endurance, or
              fatigue will also be performed via computer.          Completion of this phase
              of the project will permit future novel research on the effects of independent
              variables such as hand/handle coupling, glove type, wrist posture, ambient
              (hand) temperature, subject gender, and subject age on dependent variables such
              as force, torque, endurance, or fatigue.  These tasks require that equipment
              not in existence be developed and testing protocols for this equipment
              formulated.  The development of the equipment and testing protocols require
              time and planning which are the intent of this research planning grant. ***
