Abstract    :
              9311268  Campbell    Genetic variation of Isotria medeoloides a rare and 
              endangered species of North American orchid, is  unknown.  The investigators
              propose to use Random  Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), which permits 
              minimally destructive sampling of the plants, to  explore the population
              structure of this species.  To  test a possible link between rarity and genetic
               variability,  they will contrast percent variable  (polymorphic) loci between
              six populations of this rare  orchid with that of six populations of the only
              other  species in the genus.  To see whether population size  affects genetic
              variation, three large and three small  populations for both species will be
              compared.    %%%  Knowledge of the population genetics of this species  would
              better enable managers of this Federally  Endangered orchid to meet longterm
              recovery goals,  ascertain relative importance of the populations,  define a
              minimum viable population size, and measure  changes in total diversity over
              time.
