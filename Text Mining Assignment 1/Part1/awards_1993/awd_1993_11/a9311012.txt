Abstract    :
              9311012  HANSELL      Although most of the research effort in marine organic
              geochemistry  has been directed toward particulate material, most of the
              organic  matter in the world ocean is dissolved (DOM). Despite its  abundance,
              little is known about the chemical nature of DOM, its  reactivity and role in
              the marine carbon and nitrogen cycles, and  its relationship to the global CO2
              cycle.  In this study the  investigator will investigate the distribution,
              production, and  mineralization of DOM (specifically the carbon and nitrogen 
              components) in the Arabian Sea.  As part of a team of scientists in  the U.S.
              JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study, the investigator will  study the relationship
              of DOM production and mineralization to  phytoplankton and bacterioplankton
              dynamics associated with  seasonal forcing by the monsoon winds.  By relating
              these studies  to other scientists' simultaneous investigations of other
              aspects  of carbon production, consumption, and transport, a clearer 
              understanding of the role of DOM in the marine carbon cycle will be  gained.
