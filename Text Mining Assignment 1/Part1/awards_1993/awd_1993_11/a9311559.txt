Abstract    :
              9311559  Ahlfeld  This is an award to support research, the objective of which
              is  to evaluate a numerical method for the design of hydraulic  controls that
              affect the movement of contaminated groundwater  during procedures to isolate,
              contain or decontaminate the water.  The method proposed consists of a
              computationally efficient  approach to combining simulation of both groundwater
              flow and  contaminant transport with optimization techniques.  The novel 
              feature of the approach the investigator is taking lies in the  use of an
              iterative scheme in which the computationally-easy  hydraulic control problem
              is solved repeatedly and at each  iteration, the constraints of the hydraulic
              model are modified by  feedback information provided by solution of the
              contaminant  transport model.    Significantly large amounts of financial and
              human resources are  being used to address the decontamination of groundwater 
              resulting from indiscriminate placement of contaminants in  landfills.   This
              research is expected to provide a more  efficient way of designing field
              systems for decontamination of  contaminated groundwater aquifers than is now
              possible using  current computing technology.  ***
