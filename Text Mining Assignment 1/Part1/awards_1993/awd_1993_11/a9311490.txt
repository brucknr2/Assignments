Abstract    :
              This planning grant is to develop a computerized activity                      
              based costing model which could be utilized by any medical                     
              care facility to determine the true cost of providing                          
              services.  The developed software will enable the users to                     
              consider tangible and intangible costs and benefits                            
              associated with providing services offered by the medical                      
              care facility.  Once the relevant literature has been                          
              evaluated and analyzed, a methodology for identifying all                      
              the activities performed in medical care facilities, and a                     
              means of tracing costs to these activities will be                             
              established.  Then a list of various cost drivers will be                      
              generated to trace the cost of the activities to the cost                      
              objects.
