Abstract    :
              9311913  Hahn  The technique of sensitive optical detection of nuclear magnetic 
              resonance (ODNMR) in semiconductors will be applied to study the  properties of
              gallium arsenide heterostructure and quantum wells.  ODNMR measurements will be
              made of electric fields, Knight shifts,  doped constituents, and impurities.  A
              new pulsed and double  resonance ODNMR technique will be developed and applied
              to GaAs  heterostructures in order to improve the detection sensitivity and 
              versatility beyond conventional cw ODNMR techniques.  The research  will focus
              on the study of spin-spin coupling between photo-induced  GaAs surface spin
              polarization and external spin systems.  %%%  This research project will
              develop new techniques involving optical  spectroscopy techniques and
              radio-frequency nuclear magnetic  resonance spectroscopy  techniques.  The
              relatively weak  interaction between a nucleus and a radio-frequency signal is 
              amplified and detected by optical or laser spectroscopy methods.   These
              techniques will be applied to surface atoms on  semiconductors.  The objective
              to detect a transfer of magnetism  from electrons in the semiconductors to
              non-semiconductor atoms  residing on the semiconductor surface.  The results
              will be of  fundamental interest and will provide unique information of 
              potential application in semiconductor technology.  ***
