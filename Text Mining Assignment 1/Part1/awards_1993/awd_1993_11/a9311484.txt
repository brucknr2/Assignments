Abstract    :
              9311484  Ragland       The CONCERT Network (Communications for North Carolina 
              Education, Research, and Technology) is a mid-level network that  serves the
              State of North Carolina.  CONCERT is connected directly  to the NSFNET Backbone
              Network.  It is the intention of CONCERT to  offer NSFNET connections to all
              higher education institutions in  North Carolina.       This proposal requests
              support to establish ten new  connections for 4 year colleges in the state
              including: Belmont  Abbey College, Bennett College, Brevard College,
              Gardner-Webb  College, Johnson C. Smith University, Louisburg College, Mars
              Hill  College, Pfeiffer College, St. Augustine's College, and St. Mary's 
              College.  Three additional colleges that have "connection" support  from other
              sources (Greensboro College, Salem College, and St.  Andrews College) request
              training and Network Information Support  (NIC Services) from the CONCERT
              organization.       A primary goal of CONCERT is to facilitate collaborative 
              projects and sharing of resources between institution, including  those outside
              the state.  CONCERT will provide operations  management and information
              services as well as provide appropriate  dedicated connections to the thirteen
              institutions.        The universities and colleges need greater functionality
              and  network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and  make
              file transfers along with being able to implement a more  reliable mail system.
               Students and faculty research will benefit  from the link.  This is also a
              unique opportunity for the schools  to explore innovative educational
              resources.  ***
