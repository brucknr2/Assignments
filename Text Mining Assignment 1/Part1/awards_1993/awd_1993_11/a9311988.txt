Abstract    :
              9311988  Perlis       All reasoning, whether by human or machine, is situated in
              the  physical world and thus subject to time constraints.  However, much  of
              the formal study of reasoning agents ignores this, assuming an  agent is able
              to reason forever in a timeless present as if the  world had stopped for the
              agent's benefit.  The early work by one  of the PIs and his student involved
              the development of a family of  logics--called "step-logics"--for this purpose.
               More recently the  PIs have begun to generalize and modify this work, renaming
              the  formalisms as "active logics".  The proposed research would seek to 
              broaden and deepen the existing results of the PIs in time-situated  reasoning,
              specifically in the areas of deadline-coupled planning  and acting;
              language-change; interactive focal points; multi-agent  reasoning; and graceful
              recognition and resolution of  contradictions.  All five of these areas are
              ones in which keeping  track of changing time during the course of reasoning is
              useful.
