Abstract    :
              9311263  TINDALE    Primary production and the vertical flux of particles in the
              ocean  appear to be linked to changing atmospheric conditions, and in the  case
              of the Arabian Sea these changing conditions include  variations in he flux of
              dust from land.  As part of the Arabian  Sea Process Study this team of
              investigators will measure changes  in the atmospheric concentrations and flux
              of dust over the Arabian  Sea during several cruises.  While at sea they will
              also estimate  the solubility of aerosol trace metals, notably iron, in
              seawater  and study of the effects on primary production.  By coupling these 
              field observations with the data of other investigators (sediment  trap studies
              and satellite reconnaissance) the investigators expect  to extrapolate their
              results to longer periods of time and  regionally over the Arabian Sea region.
