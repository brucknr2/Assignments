Abstract    :
              The research entails studying problems concerned with the optimal  density of
              sphere packings in Euclidean spaces and the geometry  of spherical simplexes
              and volumes.  Further investigations will  me made into the nature of classes
              of minimal submanifolds in  Riemannian symmetric spaces.  Besides having
              applications to  other branches of mathematics, the techniques involved may
              have  applications to processes in manufacturing and in materials  theory.
