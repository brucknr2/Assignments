Abstract    :
                   The Engineering Faculty Internship provides the Principal                 
              Investigator an opportunity to study a high-volume robotic                     
              automation system and interact with the designers and users of such            
              a system.  This system is the printer assembly system designed to              
              assemble on the order of 100,000 printers per month.  One of the               
              key problems in high volume (hundreds of thousands of units per                
              month) mechanical assembly is the lead time required to design and             
              implement automation systems and the additional time required to               
              ramp automated production to full volume for a new or redesigned               
              product.  The research is concerned with understanding the factors             
              contributing to these long lead times and lack of flexibility for              
              automated assembly systems.                                                    
                   On the basis of the collaboration of the university and                   
              industrial in conjunction with study of the system at hand, the                
              major factors contributing to long lead times and lack of                      
              flexibility will be determined, alternative designs proposed, and              
              proof-of-concept experiments conducted.
