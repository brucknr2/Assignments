Abstract    :
              9311472  Chang  Tsien Hsue-shen came to the United States from China in 1935 in 
              order to study aerodynamics at Caltech under Theodore von Karman.   During the
              McCarthy period of the Cold War, Tsien was falsely  accused of being a
              Communist spy and was forced to return to China  in 1955.  He brought back to
              his homeland all the skills he had  learned in the US and became the lead
              rocket scientist for the  Chinese military.  Under his guidance, China
              developed its own  ballistic missiles capable of carrying warheads to destroy
              targets  throughout Asia.  Ms. Chang is undertaking a study of this "Father  of
              the Chinese Missile" both in the US and in China.    Ms. Chang's study of
              Tsien's life promises to shed new light on the  history of the development of
              nuclear missiles in both the US and  China and to illuminate some of the
              worldwide consequences of  McCarthyism.  Her study also includes an account of
              the turbulent  relationship between science and politics of the 20th century 
              through the analysis of scientific mentorship of three generations  of
              world-class aerodynamicists--Ludwig Prantl who taught von Karman  in Germany
              who taught Tsien in the US.  Prantl disowned von Karman,  a Jew, in Nazi
              Germany.  In turn, von Karman failed Tsien when he  was attacked by the
              McCarthyites.  Tsien, following his mentors,  denounced his students during the
              Cultural Revolution of 1965.  ***
