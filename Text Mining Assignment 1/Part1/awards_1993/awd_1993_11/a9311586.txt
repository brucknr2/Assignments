Abstract    :
              9311586  Zuo    This ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (UHV-STM) 
              will greatly improve faculty and student research opportunities  in both the
              Department of Physics and Astronomy (principally) and  the Department of
              Biomedical Sciences at Southwest Missouri State  University (SMSU). Current
              research efforts related to the  equipment in the Department of Physics and
              Astronomy are  molecular beam epitaxial growth and characterization of compound
               semiconductors and the related device physics, conducting  polymers, and
              synchrotron radiation studies of local crystal  structures.   Research programs
              in the Department of Biomedical  Sciences include the fine structure
              examination of biological  specimens.  The requested UHV-STM, a very powerful
              tool in the  study of geometric/electronic structures of surfaces and 
              interfaces with atomic resolution, will enhance our  microstructure analysis
              capability.  Its availability will not  only extend our current research
              efforts into an important area  connecting electronic and optical properties of
              materials with  their microstructures, but will also give students a direct 
              experience of frontier research and better prepare them for entry  into
              graduate study or careers in various scientific disciplines.  ***
