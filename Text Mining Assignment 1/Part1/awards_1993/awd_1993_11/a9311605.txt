Abstract    :
              9311605  Genack  The aim of this proposal is to give a clear picture of the 
              transition from diffusive to localized propagation for microwave  and optical
              radiation.  Using tunable single frequency sources,  short pulses and
              subwavelength spatial resolution, the key  statistical characteristic of wave
              propagation and the microscopic  scattering parameters are determined in an
              ensemble of random  scatterers.  Measurements are made of the scaling of the 
              probability distributions, correlation function and average value  of the
              intensity, transmission and conductance as well as time of  flight distribution
              of localized waves.  The description of  propagation is cast into a universal
              form using appropriate  combinations of scattering parameters, sample geometry
              and boundary  conditions.  %%%  Classical wave propagation is the vehicle for
              communication and  provides a measure for discovering the structure of
              inhomogenous  systems.  Moreover, it serves as a model for electronic transport
               in ultrasmall systems.  The aim of this project is to find a  universal
              description of the transition from diffusive regime  (random scattering from
              many centers, like atoms and molecules) to  a "localized" regime where the
              light is no longer able to propagate  through the medium.  This is a subtle and
              complicated effect that  is known for electrons in the semiconductor world, but
              is just now  being explored for optical and mircrowave radiation propagating 
              through macroscopic media.  The research has important implications  for
              photonic materials development and technological applications  such as compact
              filters and switches.  ***
