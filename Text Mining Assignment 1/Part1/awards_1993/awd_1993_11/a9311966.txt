Abstract    :
              Under an SGER award the feasibility of growing thin coatings of                
              mullite (3 Al2O3 . 2 SiO2) on ceramic substrates will be studied.              
              The deposition method will be chemical vapor deposition of ultra-              
              thin layers of the constituent compounds, followed by post-                    
              deposition heat treatment to form the mullite by inter diffusion.              
              Process characteristics for development of optimal properties of               
              oxidation resistance, resistance to sodium attack, spall                       
              resistance during thermal cycling, and hardness will be developed              
              for substrates of silicon carbide and silicon nitride ceramics.                
              The possibility of depositing functionally graded coatings by                  
              this technique on these substrates will also be evaluated.
