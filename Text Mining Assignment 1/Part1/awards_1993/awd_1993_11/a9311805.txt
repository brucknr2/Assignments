Abstract    :
              9311805  Wachs       This award supports the research of Professor Wachs to work
               in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics.  The first and major  part of this
              proposal deals with the study of combinatorial  aspects of topological
              properties of partially ordered sets.   These studies provide a deep and
              fundamental link between  combinatorics and other branches of mathematics, such
              as  topology, algebra and geometry.       The research is in the general area
              of combinatorics.   Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study
              how  discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete  systems
              is extremely important to modern communications.  For  example, the design of
              large networks, as in telephone systems,  and the design of algorithms in
              computer science all deal with  discrete objects, and this makes use of
              combinatorial research.  ***
