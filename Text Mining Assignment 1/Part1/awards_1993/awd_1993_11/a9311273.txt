Abstract    :
              9311273  Root    The introduction of two closely related European chrysomelid
              beetles (Galerucella calmariensis and G. pusilla) by the U.S.D.A. for the
              biological control of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), and problem weed
              in wetlands, is a unique opportunity to study the population dynamics of
              ecological invasions.  A third congeneric species, G. nympheae, is native to
              North America and feeds on purple loosestrife only in limited locations.    The
              study uses a comparative approach to assess the factors affecting both local
              establishment and geographical spread of these three beetle populations. 
              Differences in the probability of  local establishment, both among species and
              for different numbers of insects released, will be determined using replicated
              releases in isolated locations.  A separate, single, large release will be used
              to track the patterns of spread through a heterogeneous environment.  %%% 
              Invasion biology, the study of the establishment and spread of exotic species,
              is a field of  growing interest and importance, particularly  as the impact of
              humans in biological exchanges between regions has increased markedly.  This
              project focuses on factors influencing the establishment and spread of exotic
              populations and their role in the biological control of pest species.  ***
