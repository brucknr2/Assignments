Abstract    :
              9311949  Murthy  A theoretical research program will be conducted to understand
              the  low-energy electronic properties of doped fullerenes.  The 
              renormalization group method augmented by exact solutions for small  systems
              will be the primary theoretical technique used.   Specifically, the following
              topics will be addressed: exactly solve  small fullerene analogs by the Lanczos
              method; carry out a momentum  shell renormalization group on the fullerene
              molecule and obtain  effective interactions at the Fermi surface; use the 
              renormalization group to identify important correlations on a  fullerene
              molecule and construct a variational wave function  leading to an understanding
              of the physical mechanism of pairing;  include the relevant intrafullerene
              phonons in the renormalization  group; use the renormalization group for the
              full crystal to  generate the appropriate superconducting mean-field theory. 
              %%%  This theoretical study will attempt to understand the properties of  the
              new fullerene molecule.  In particular, the thrust of the work  will be on
              applying new techniques developed for the study of phase  transitions in order
              to understand the superconducting properties  of these new materials.  If
              successful, the techniques developed  will have wide application in addition to
              contributing to the  understanding of superconductivity in the fullerenes.  ***
