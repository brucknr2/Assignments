Abstract    :
              9311967  Offutt  This project is investigating the relative merits of unit-level
               software testing techniques, specifically various data-flow  criteria and
              mutation testing.  It is developing and implementing  algorithms for
              automatically generating test data to satisfy data-  flow criteria.  Heuristic
              procedures for determining program sub  paths that cannot be executed are also
              being investigated.  The  techniques studied will be evaluated on an
              experimental basis,  using combination of fault detection ability and relative 
              abilities of the studied criteria to cover each other.  Recent  results with
              constraint-based test data generation strongly  indicate that test data can be
              automatically generated to test  software program units according to the
              data-flow criteria.  This  project would develop algorithms that can be used to
              improve the  current state of practice and research in testing software.  It 
              would also provide evidence concerning the efficacy of testing  criteria with
              the objective of improving the quality of software.  ***
