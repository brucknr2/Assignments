Abstract    :
              9311210  Whitham       Primary work has detect an interaction involving beavers,
              leaf  beetles, and cottonwood trees:  beetles appear to hypothesis that 
              beetles benefit from beaver herbivory.  cottonwoods contain  salicin, a
              chemical that is an effective defense against mammalian  herbivores but is
              sequestered and used by the beetles for their own  defense,  the PIs pose that
              beetles are attracted to beaver-cut  trees because the resprout growth is both
              nutritionally superior  and chemically better defended.    Beetles fed resprout
              growth develop faster, weigh more at maturity,  and are better defended against
              predators than those fed  nonresprout growth.  This study expands previous work
              to assess  whether 1) resprout cottonwood is nutritionally a better food 
              resource for beetles and 2) resprout cotton wood contains more  defensive
              chemicals that directly benefit the beetles.  The study  also examines the
              importance of beaver herbivory in affecting the  distribution of beetles and
              will examine the generality of this  interaction by censuring other river
              systems.  %%%  Indirect interactions between distantly related taxed have
              rarely  been studied in detail.  The current study focuses on such on 
              interaction.  This is important to identify in the cottonwood  system because
              beavers are keystone species that can alter the  environment at the landscape
              level, & cottonwoods are currently  suffering widespread dieback in the western
              US..  ***
