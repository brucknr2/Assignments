Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory of the University of              
              Massachusetts and the University of Oklahoma will collaborate to               
              investigate tornadoes.  UMass graduate students will install a 95              
              GHz polarimetric radar in a chase van and operate the system during            
              field measurements with researchers of the University of Oklahoma's            
              School of Meteorology.  This will present an opportunity to obtain             
              the best spatial resolution of a tornado's radar reflectivity and              
              wind fields ever achieved.  The use of polarimetric millimeter wave            
              radars for this application is untested, and engineers and                     
              meteorologists will research jointly.
