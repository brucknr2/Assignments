Abstract    :
              9311031  Durrani  The main objective of this equipment  grant is the acquisition
              of a  shaking table facility by the Civil  Engineering Department of Rice 
              University.  The shaking table  facility is needed to test up to  one-fifth
              scale structural models  under dynamic base excitation.  The  shaking table
              will be 5 ft x 5 ft in  size with a test load capacity of  1,500 pounds.  The
              highest frequency  targeted for the table is 40 Hz.   Rice has cost-shared
              approximately  half of the total requested amount  for this experimental
              equipment and  will continue to maintain and  upgrade the system in the future.
                The availability of a shaking table  will enable experimental  verification
              of several ongoing and  future research projects related to  seismic response
              of structures.    The installation of a shaking table  in the structures
              laboratory will  complement the existing research  focus on analytical research
              and  will provide the foundation for a  wide range of future projects in 
              experimental structural dynamics.  ***
