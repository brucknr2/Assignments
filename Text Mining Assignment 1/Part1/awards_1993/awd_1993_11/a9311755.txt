Abstract    :
              An Engineering Faculty Internship will provide funds to match                  
              support from Durametallic Corporation.  The award will enable the              
              PI to study heat generation and dissipation in mechanical seals.               
              The temperature distributions in various solid components and in               
              the liquid will be predicted by computation and the results will               
              subsequently be validated by experimental work to be done on a                 
              specialized test rig located at the industrial site.  The results              
              will be used to develop design codes for design of mechanical                  
              seals with minimal leakage and friction losses.
