Abstract    :
              9311079  Mulkey   The purpose of this Dissertation Improvement grant is to
              examine relative   growth rates, root-shoot ratios, net assimilation, and
              relative species dominance   as determinants of productivity and community
              composition under constraints of   light, mycorrhizal infection, and hyphal
              transfer. A series of experiments will   examine these factors at the
              individual, intraspecific, and interspecific levels in   the laboratory and in
              the field. Field experiments using labeled phosphorus and   carbon will be used
              to monitor transfer of nutrients from mycorrhizal fungi to   plants and vice
              versa. Studies will be conducted at the Smithsonian Tropical   Forest Research
              Institute to address the role of fungi in the restoration of   degraded
              tropical forest ecosystems.  %%%  This study will obtain the first tropical
              data on the complex interactions of light,   infection, and translocation, and
              will demonstrate the extent to which these affect   individual plant production
              in a community, as well as local community dynamics.   These data are critical
              for a better understanding of the belowground ecosystem   and how it affects
              natural succession and reforestation in the tropics.  ***
