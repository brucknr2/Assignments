In order to gain a more complete understanding of how a neural circuit produces the behavior of swimming, the team will utilize the technique of optical recording to observe entire neural circuits within the seaslug, Tritonia.  The Tritonia diomedea is a seaslug which lives on muddy bottoms in coastal waters near Japan.  Contact with a predator elicits the Tritonia escape swimming response which consists of two to twenty alternating ventral and dorsal whole body flexions.  For twenty years neuroscientists have used the Tritonia swim response as a model system for studying the neural basis of rhythmic motor patterns.  Although the neural circuit for swimming is comparatively well understood, there are some inhibitory interneurons which are thought to exist but have not been found using conventional eletrophysiological procedures such as microelectrodes.   By using voltage sensitive dyes, Brown and Shiono will optically record many neurons in the isolated brain of Tritonia while the swim neural response is elicited by nerve root stimulation.  Brown's extensive knowledge of the Tritonia swim circuit's behavior, morphology, and physiology complements Shiono's expertise in optical recording techniques and will enable the team to identify and locate the missing links in the swim circuit.  Once these unknown interneurons are found, Brown and Shiono will be able to more accurately understand the neural basis of swimming and how it is modulated during learning .
