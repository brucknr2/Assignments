Abstract    :
              9311881  Henderson  The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact of air
               quality regulation between 1970 and 1987 on (1) urban location  and
              productivity for a variety of manufacturing industries, and  on (2) air quality
              across metropolitan areas and between central  cities and suburbs.  Equations
              for 1987 concerning location,  employment growth, and productivity will be
              estimated directly,  based upon current and historical industrial environments
              and  regulation, accounting for issues of simultaneity, censoring, and 
              selectivity.  While regulation in non-attainment areas may have  resulted in a
              reallocation of industrial activity  across  metropolitan areas, with
              corresponding productivity gains and  losses, improved environmental quality in
              non-attainment areas  has positive impact for industry through lower wages. 
              Hedonic  wage functions capturing the link between air quality and wages  will
              be estimated, accounting for issues of simultaneity and  joint wage-land rent
              determination.  This project is important  because it will shed new light on
              the economic effects and impact  on urban air quality of air pollution
              regulations.  ***
