Abstract    :
              9311509  Stephanopoulos  This project is on research for  modification of the
              metabolic  pathway in Corynebacterium  glutamicum for the production of  amino
              acids of the aspartic acid  family (lysine and threonine).   Specifically, the
              fluxes at the  phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP), pyruvate  (PYR), and
              aspartyl-semialdehyde  (ASA) junctions are to be  redistributed to improve
              product  yields, the most critical component  in the cost structure of amino
              acid  manufacturing.  This will be  accomplished by a program that will 
              attempt enzyme deregulation,  amplification and synchronization at  the PEP,
              PYR and ASA junctions, in  addition to fermentation studies  that will exploit
              the improved  cellular properties in the design of  an optimal bioreactor
              system.  ***
