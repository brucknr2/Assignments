Abstract    :
              This proposal calls for the study of the process of acoustic  cavitation and the
              accompanying emission of electromagnetic  radiation.  The light observed in
              this process is called  sonoluminescence.  In the process of propagating
              acoustic  waves through a liquid containing microscopic cavitation can  be
              violent enough to damage even hardened materials, and the  effective
              temperature within the bubbles can reach thousands  of degrees.  There is a
              lack of knowledge of the physical  and chemical processes occurring in these
              processes.  However recent studies have produced conditions wherein a  single,
              stable cavitation bubble is observed to generate  sonoluminescence every cycle.
               "Temperatures" associated  with these bubbles appear to reach levels near
              100,000K and  the electromagnetic emissions inexplicably achieve a level  of
              synchronity that is repetitive to within a part 1011.  The duration of these
              synchronous pulses is less that 50 ps.  Several technological applications of
              this process have been  suggested.  This proposal is for the study of the basic
               physics of this process.
