Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, a                        
              Controlled Stress Rheometer is to be purchased for use in the                  
              PI's departmental laboratory in several projects. The projects                 
              are all in the area of coatings and ceramic suspensions. They                  
              include microgels for coatings, evaluation of floculants, and                  
              liquid composites for better fiber spinnability. The issue in                  
              these areas is quantifying particle interactions in                            
              concentrated dispersions.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The relevance of the research is to more environmentally                       
              friendly coatings, and better polymer fibers for a variety of                  
              industrial uses.
