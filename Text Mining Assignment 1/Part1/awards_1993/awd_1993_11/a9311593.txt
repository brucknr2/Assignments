Abstract    :
              9311593  Dietz         This is a project designed to develop an improved model 
              for  studying  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  trends  in 
              population,  affluence,  and  technology.   Each  portion  of  the  simple 
              equation  often  used  to   assess  environmental  impacts  (I=PAT)  will  be 
              reformulated   to  reflect  added  complexity, and  then  time  series,  cross-
               sectional, and pooled time series cross-sectional data  from  a  variety  of
              nations will be used to estimate  new  models  incorporating these changes.    
                 This  project  has  the potential  to  make  important  contributions  not
              only to our theoretical understanding  of  the   sources  of  environmental 
              problems,  but   also   to  environmental policy.  Previous work using the 
              I=PAT  model  has  been  hindered  by the oversimplified  and  unrealistic 
              nature  of the variables used and the relationships  assumed  to  exist among
              them, thus making it impossible to use  this  model to accurately study and
              forecast environmental trends.  To  the  extent  that  this project is
              successful,  it  will  overcome these difficulties.  ***
