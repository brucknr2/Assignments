Abstract    :
              9311918  Chan    This project involves studies undertaken to further the 
              understanding of the effect of frozen-in disorder (including the  dilute limit)
              on the behavior of systems undergoing continuous  phase transitions.  This will
              be accomplished by placing 4He and  3He-4He mixtures inside porous gold and
              silica aerogel.  These two  substrates, owing to the different manufacturing
              processes, provide  disorder that are respectively correlated and uncorrelated
              at large  length scales -- thus allowing for a critical test of current 
              theoretical ideas.  Preliminary results indicate that when a 3He-  4He mixture
              is placed inside light aerogel, the coexistence region  at low temperature
              detaches from the superfluid transition line,  giving rise to a novel miscible
              superfluid mixture at high 3He  concentration.  This mixture may represent the
              realization of a  dilute Bose gas system and suggests the possibility of
              observing an  interpenetrating double superfluid in the limit of zero 
              temperature.  %%%  In the last twenty years, physicists have made great
              advances in  understanding the behavior of pure substances undergoing
              continuous  phase transformations, for example from liquid to vapor or from 
              superconducting or superfluid states to the normal state.  This  knowledge is
              not always applicable to realistic situations as most  substances contain
              defects and impurities.  This project will  investigate the effects of
              impurities and disorder on the nature of  the continuous phase transitions by
              placing nature's purest  substance, liquid helium, inside a disordered
              environment -- porous  glass or porouss gold.  Since the open fraction of the
              porous  glasses ranges from 0.98 to 0.3, this is akin to the situation  where
              the impurities constitute from two to twenty percent of a  sample.  Preliminary
              results indicate that impurities have a  profound and unexpected effect on both
              the liquid-vapor and the  superfluid transitions, and suggest new mechanisms as
              to how fluid  mixtures undergo mixing and demixi ng.  ***
