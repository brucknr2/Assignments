Abstract    :
              9311884  Seligman       This project supports research in algebra.  One of the 
              principal investigators will work on the realization of finite  groups as
              Galois groups of extensions of specified fields.  The  other principal
              investigator will study the internal structure of  simple Lie algebras in prime
              charateristic, where the ground  field is assumed algebraically closed and over
              general fields of  characteristic zero.  The majority of the support is for
              graduate  students working with the principal investigators.       This award
              supports research in two areas of algebra --  finite group theory and the
              theory of Lie algebras.  A group is  an algebraic object with a single
              operation defined on it.  It  has important applications in mathematics,
              chemistry, computer  science and physics.  Lie algebras arise from another
              object  called a Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations  of a
              sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie  groups and Lie algebras
              are important in areas involving analysis  of spherical motion.  ***
