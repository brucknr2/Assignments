Abstract    :
                   This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research in support of              
              the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) Initiative.  In an                 
              unprecedented world wide effort, numerous commercial organizations             
              and universities have joined together under the AEGIS of the IMS               
              test case for "Holistic Manufacturing Systems" to conduct a one                
              year feasibility study. This grant provides partial support for a              
              student to work in this effort.                                                
                   This support is important in that it provides student                     
              involvement in a project that may be the forerunner of a new                   
              paradigm for the way research is to be performed.
