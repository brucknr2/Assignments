Abstract    :
              9311403  Cohn    This project will examine how the changing legal cultures may 
              affect new democracies and other systems that are either in  transition or
              authoritarian.  This transnational study will compare  orientations toward law
              and normative ordering in three new  democracies in Eastern Central Europe
              (Hungary, Poland and  Bulgaria) to those in more established democracies
              (Spain, France  and the United States).  This research represents the first
              phase  of a project which will measure citizen rights consciousness, and 
              attitudes toward procedural justice and rights and duties in these  six
              countries.  During this first phase, the investigator, working  with U.S.
              collaborators and collaborators in various countries in  Eastern Europe, will
              develop a survey questionnaire to measure  attitudes towards law and normative
              ordering across the six  countries.  The questionnaire will be pretested in the
              U.S. and the  five foreign countries and surveys conducted in two U.S. cities. 
               Findings from this preliminary work will be analyzed and used to  develop a
              larger study in the five foreign countries.  %%%  This research will increase
              knowledge about orientations toward law  and normative ordering in countries
              which are in different stages  of democratization.  It will also contribute to
              our understanding  of how to successfully conduct cross-cultural surveys.   ***
