              continue with a program of research which has the goal of detecting a short
              burst of gravitational waves. The program has three parts:  1) continued
              observation with the LSU bar type gravitational wave antenna, 2) improvement of
              its sensitivity; and 3) preparation of a detailed design for a new type of
              detector which promises to be much more sensitive.          The LSU detector
              has been observing for 2 years.  Its sensitivity to short bursts is now the
              best ever obtained by any detector anywhere (average burst gravitational strain
                      2 `     noise is 6x10          19   ), and is probably sufficient to
              detect the gravitational waves from a supernova within our galaxy.  The LSU
              group will continue to operate their detector, until they are ready to improve
              its sensitivity.  Data exchange and searches for coincidences with any other
              detectors operational will continue.          The LSU group will also
              investigate a new type of detector with a nearly spherical shape, the Truncated
              Icosahedral Gravitational wave Antenna, or TIGA.  They have already published
              calculati ons that predict a 56 fold increase in energy sensitivity for a TIGA
              detector, compared to the equivalent bar type antenna.  A TIGA system could
              consist of several omni directional detectors at different frequencies, all
              designed to work in coincidence with each other and with the Laser
              Interferometer Gravitational (LIGO).  The LSU group will continue its program
              to verify the theoretical predictions by experimental measurement on a
              prototype TIGA.          In collaboration with other U.S. resonant mass
              detector groups, the LSU gravitational physics group will undertake the
              detailed design of a TIGA system of gravitational wave detectors.  The goal of
              the collaborative research effort will be the production, by January of 1995,
              of a detailed design and a plan for the construction and operation of the
              system in conjunction with all other gravitational wave detectors in the world.
