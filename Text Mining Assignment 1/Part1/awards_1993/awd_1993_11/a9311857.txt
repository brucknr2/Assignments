Abstract    :
              9311857  Burby  Credible arguments can be made for both deterrent and
              cooperative  approaches to code enforcement, but at present we know relatively 
              little about the extent to which agencies are using deterrent or  cooperative
              enforcement techniques, or about their antecedents  and their consequences for
              improved compliance.  Much of the  discussion in the literature is normative
              and anecdotal, and  focused mainly on federal regulatory programs.  Thus, there
              seems  to be a clear need to begin examining empirically strategies  local
              governments are using to enforce building codes.    This research has five main
              aims: (1) to determine the degree to  which deterrent and cooperative
              enforcement techniques are being  used in enforcing building codes in areas
              subject to seismic  hazards; (2) to isolate agency and community
              characteristics that  facilitate the use of each approach; (3) to document the 
              strengths and weaknesses of each approach, based on the  perceptions and actual
              experiences of code enforcement personnel;  (4) to isolate factors associated
              with successful and  unsuccessful experiences with deterrent and cooperative 
              enforcement (in other words, in what circumstances does each work  well and
              less well?); and (5) to assess the implications of these  findings for federal
              and state efforts to foster more effective  enforcement of the seismic
              provisions of codes and for future  federal and state hazard mitigation
              programs.  These goals will  be accomplished through a national survey and
              community case  studies.  ***
