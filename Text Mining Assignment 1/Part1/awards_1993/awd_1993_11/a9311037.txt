Abstract    :
              9311037  Numbers  Science and religion have had a long and at times contentious 
              relationship in the United States.  Within the past decade,  advocates of more
              fundamentalist Christian sects have argued that  many of the theories of
              contemporary science, especially the theory  of evolution, have been advanced
              by a "religion" known as secular  humanism.  The fundamentalists have offered
              an alternative  creationist theory and have convinced at least two state 
              legislatures that the opposing theories should have equal standing  in biology
              classes.  In his dissertation research, Mr. Sheldon is  examining the
              development of "secular humanism" and its  relationship to science in 20th
              century America.  His objectives  are to understand the role of science and
              religion in humanist  thought and the ways in which prominent scientists and
              popularists  have adopted humanism as a framework for the presentation of the 
              history, discoveries and methods of science.  The project focuses  on John
              Dewey, H. J. Muller, Carl Sagan, B. F. Skinner and others.    The project
              involves a thorough survey of the primary humanist  journals in America as well
              as published works of the principal  actors and critics.  In addition, Mr.
              Sheldon is using interviews  and archival research to provide crucial data on
              the institutional  development of humanism and its relation to scientists and
              their  ideas.  ***
