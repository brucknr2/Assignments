Abstract    :
              9311151  Chryssostomidis  The Underwater Vehicles Laboratory of the  M.I.T. Sea
              Grant College Program will  purchase oceanographic sensors and sensor  support
              equipment to enable the use of  existing Autonomous Underwater Vehicles  (AUVs)
              as tools for oceanographic research.   Six missions have been chosen to direct
              this  effort, including: 1) The investigation of  plate tectonics and spreading
              centers through  geomagnetic measurements off the coast of  Antarctica. 2) The
              development of geophysical  navigation methods, 3) The creation of a 
              rapid-response AUV to investigate transient  ocean events, 4) The use of AUV
              development  as a method of enhancing engineering  education, 5) The
              development  of  methodologies for applying AUVs to study of  shallow-water
              environments, and 6) The study  of  the mechanics of Arctic ice.  The high 
              operating cost of research vessels constrains  oceanic research.  AUVs
              increasing the search  rate of the ocean floor, greatly increasing  the
              efficiency of the time spent at sea.
