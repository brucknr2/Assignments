Abstract    :
              9311959  Albrecht  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program of the 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. A. Albrecht of Cornell University  will use
              four-wave-mixing nonlinear spectroscopies to study the  molecular condensed
              phase.  The electronic properties of medium  -to-large polyatomic molecules
              will be investigated to provide  data for the continued testing of different
              theoretical models  for quantum chemical calculations. Also studied will be the
               dynamics in the condensed phase by probing the stochastic  processes that are
              responsible for vibrational and electronic  lineshaping.  The nonlinear
              techniques that will be used in  these studies are interferometric coherent
              spectroscopy (ICS)  using phase-noisy light and femtosecond coherent
              spectroscopy.  %%%  This research will contribute to the ability to extract 
              information about the molecular dynamics in excited electronic  states and
              solute-solvent interactions in various complex  systems.  The ICS technique is
              still in its early developmental  stage but promises to reveal signals due to
              Raman transitions  that are hidden by solution-phase broadening interactions. 
              This has special significance for the study of biological  materials for which
              the technique of Raman spectroscopy is  preferred since it is not affected by
              the strong absorptions  due to water which renders the method of infrared
              spectroscopy  inappropriate.  Additional advantages accrue for situations 
              where remote coherent detection with pulses of visible light is  advantageous.
