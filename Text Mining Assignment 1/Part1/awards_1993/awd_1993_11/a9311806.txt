Abstract    :
              9311806  Shafit-Zagardo    A neuron has numerous processes, axons and dendrites,
              which allows each neuron to communicate with other neurons. The cytoskeleton of
              a neuron is essential for maintaining these processes. Microtubule-associated
              proteins are a highly specialized family of cytoskeletal proteins found in the
              processes of neurons. The major microtubule-associated protein found in
              dendrites is MAP-2. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter molecule that functions in
              signaling between neurons.  Receptors for glutamate are present in the
              dendrites of many neurons and when activated, they trigger a series of changes
              within the neuron such as increases in calcium and modulation of certain
              intracellular messengers. These changes can result in changes in the
              architecture of the dendrites. This project will test the hypothesis that
              activation of the glutamate receptor results in changes in MAP-2, which
              ultimately results in changes in the form of the neuron. The results from this
              study will supply insights into the mechanisms responsible for development of
              specific patterns of connections between cells in the nervous system.  ***
