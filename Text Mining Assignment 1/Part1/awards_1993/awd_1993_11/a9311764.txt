Abstract    :
              9311764  Bansil    The processes of phase separation in polymer solutions and
              gels are  of importance both technologically and from a fundamental  viewpoint.
               An understanding of the kinetics of these processes is  crucial to either
              promote or prevent phase separation in the  fabrication of composite materials.
                 Small-angle light scattering and video microscopic techniques will  be used
              to study the kinetics of phase separation processes via the  mechanisms of
              spinodal decomposition and nucleation in polymer  solutions and gels.  By
              combining these two methods it is possible  to explore phase separation
              kinetics from early to late stages and  also to determine the time-evolution of
              both the structure factor  and the real-space morphology.  The aim of the
              proposed study is to  determine the relationships characterizing the time
              evolution of  the domain structure following a quench into the two phase
              region.  ***
