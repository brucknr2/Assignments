Abstract    :
                  9311703  Staiger    With the use and abuse of antidumping law now a central
              concern  of both multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations, it is 
              especially important to gain as full an understanding as possible  of the
              impact of existing antidumping laws on the free flow of  trade.  In this
              project, the determinants and the effects of  antidumping investigations in the
              United States over the period  1980-1985 are examined.  Rather than focusing
              primarily on  antidumping duties alone, this research considers antidumping law
               more broadly, paying particular attention to the on-going  investigation
              effects of antidumping procedures on imports and  domestic output, and to
              whether such effects could be  sufficiently important to encourage filing of
              petitions that,  absent these effects, would not be worth pursuing.  The
              project  includes these broader aspects of antidumping law in an effort  both
              to assess more accurately the determinants and the effects  of antidumping
              petitions as well as to evaluate several  hypotheses suggested by recent
              theoretical work on antidumping  law.  A novel aspect of this research will be
              to disentangle the  effects on imports and domestic output of the various
              phases of  the antidumping investigation process along the lines suggested  by
              recent economic theory.    ***
