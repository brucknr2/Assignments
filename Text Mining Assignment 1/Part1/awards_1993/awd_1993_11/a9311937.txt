Abstract    :
              9311937  McClymont       This project focuses on obtaining a theoretical
              understanding  of the relationship between active regions and the solar dynamo
              in  which the magnetic fields, and possibly free energy, are generated,  and
              the dissipation of magnetic free energy in solar flares.  The  investigation
              encompasses a study of flux emergence, with the goal  of determining whether a
              flux tube model of the sub photospheric  magnetic field can explain observed
              characteristics of active  region development, and a study of magnetic
              reconnection in the  corona, with the aim of understanding the scaling of the 
              reconnection rate with resistivity, the effect of gas pressure on  current
              sheet formation, and the relationship between magnetic  reconnection in an
              incompressible fluid and reconnection in a  pressureless fluid.  This research
              will lead to a greater  understanding of the formation and evolution of active
              regions of  the sun.  ***
