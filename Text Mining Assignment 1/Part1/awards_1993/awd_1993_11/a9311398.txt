Abstract    :
              9311398  Gregor    The muscles, joints, tendons, and bones that form the joints
              of  weight-bearing vertebrate limbs comprise an exquisite biological  solution
              to a staggering difficult mechanical problem. Not only do  these joints perform
              essential functions such as locomotion,  climbing and leaping, they do it with
              grace and economy of motion.   No artifical system comes even close to solving
              these problems in  an elegant, functional and esthetically pleasing way. This
              new NSF  award to an expert in kinesthesiology (the science of biological  
              motion) will allow him to study an animal model system of  multijoint control
              using sophisticated force transducers and high  speed cinematography. The
              questions he will address include (1) the  contributions of each bi-articular
              muscle to the generalized muscle  moment at the knee and ankle joints; and (2)
              the power output of  each muscle-tendon unit and their contriubtion to the
              total joint  power.  The results will provide data that can be used to model 
              general solutions to these problems and will be of interest to  robotics
              designers, rehabilitation specialists and sports  scientists. ***
