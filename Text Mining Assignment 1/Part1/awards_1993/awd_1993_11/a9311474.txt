Abstract    :
              9311474  Akasofu  Substorm studies would significant by advance if we could
              identify  the directly driven component and the unloading component and how 
              they vary as a function of time during a substorm.  Unfortunately,  the present
              accuracy of substorm and storm indices, such as AE, Dst  and Ut, is not
              sufficient for such proposes; in particular in  advancing a study of the
              relationship between the energy dissipated  in the magnetosphere with solar
              wind and IMF parameters, such as V,  Bz,  , etc.  It is proposed to examine:
              (i) whether "void regions"  in DMSP particle data can be regarded as a "working
              definition" of  open field line regions in the polar cap and (ii) if so,
              changes of  the size of the void region during many substorms could indicate 
              changes of the open flux, on the basis of simultaneous DMSP  electron data
              together with the IMF Bz, AE, Dst,  , etc.  If the  "working definition" of the
              open field line region could be  confirmed, the size of the open field line
              region is a relatively  simple geometrical quantity, but yet a measure of the
              flux of the  open field lines and of magnetic energy in the tail lobe.  A 
              comparison of the flux with IMF and magnetospheric parameters is  expected to
              provide important insights into substorm processes.  ***
