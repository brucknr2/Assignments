Abstract    :
                                                 9311390  Joseph    This is a three-year
              cooperative research project proposed by  Dr. Babu Joseph, Washington
              University, and Professor Shi-Shang  Jang, National Tsing Hau University.  This
              proposal is to conduct  study on the quality control of batch chemical
              manufacturing  processing using artifical intelligence based model predictive 
              controllers.  This is an excellent international cooperative  project.  Dr.
              Jang in Taiwan will do the experimental work on the  batch reactor and generate
              data, and Dr. Joseph will use the data  generated to improve the model
              prediction for the quality control  of batch chemical manufacturing processing.
               This is a high  priority area for NSF.  This project is jointly suported by
              the  NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council (NSC), which provides 
              extensive support for laboratory operation and data collection.   The modest
              support from the NSF in this case is extensively  leveraged by the NSC.
