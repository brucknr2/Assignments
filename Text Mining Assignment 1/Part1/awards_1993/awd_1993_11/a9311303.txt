Abstract    :
              ATM-9311303  Miller  University of Colorado  Title:    Collaborative Research:
              Drought in the Australian  Outback: Milankovitch and Anthropogenic Forcing of
              the Australian  Monsoon    The Lake Eyre Basin, an interior basin covering one
              sixth of the  Australian continent, receives the vast majority of its 
              precipitation from cyclonic disturbances associated with the summer  monsoon. 
              The Australian summer monsoon is strongly influenced by  the Asian winter
              monsoon, the intensity of which is controlled by  changes in solar radiation
              caused by variations in the Earth's  orbit around the sun (Milankovitch
              effect).    This award supports research designed 10 to develop an improved 
              geochronology of lake-full events as a first-order test of the  proposition
              that January insolation over the Tibetan Plateau can be  as a proxy for the
              intensity of the Australian monsoon; 2) to  produce an independent
              reconstruction of aridity for the last 150  ka across the basin, and
              reconstruct vegetation during the last  lake-full interval (60-70 ka), using
              the isotopic composition of  organic and inorganic molecules preserved in
              ratite eggshells  (reflecting the proportion of C3 and C4 plants), and 3) to
              test the  potential impact of vegetation change on climate by modeling the 
              penetration of monsoonal precipitation into the Lake Eyre Basin  with a
              high-resolution (3o grid) Global Circulation Model  incorporating two different
              vegetation regimes.
