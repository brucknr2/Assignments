Abstract    :
              9311301  Doak    Unlike most plants which obtain water and nutrients from the
              soil and carbohydrates from photosynthesis, parasitic plant species obtain at
              least some of their water, nutrients, and carbohydrates by tapping into the
              vascular systems of other plant species.  Despite their widespread occurrence,
              the role of parasitic plants in structuring plant and herbivore communities has
              received little attention from researchers.  The proposed research will examine
              the role of nutrient, water, and secondary compound transfer from host plants
              to parasitic plants, and the effect of this transfer not only on the plant
              species, but also on the insect herbivores exploiting both the parasite and
              host plants.    A series of  field and greenhouse studies will 1) examine the
              effects of parasitic plants on their surrounding plant and herbivore
              communities and 2) compare the impacts and interactions of two types of plant
              predators, parasitic plants and herbivores,  on host plant performance and
              plant community structure.  This work will provide information on when and why
              parasitic plants exert significant effects in natural ecological communities
              and in agricultural settings, where several parasitic plants are economically
              important weeds.  %%%  More generally, this work will examine a complex
              parasite-host interaction from the viewpoint of its community-wide effects and
              its indirect interactions on other co-occurring species.  ***  INI            P
