Abstract    :
              Harry Atwater  Abstract    The acquistion of a quantitative high-resolution
              video imaging  system is proposed.  The system will be used in conjunction with
               existing transmission electron microscopes for (i) atomic-scale  imaging of
              thin films and nanoparticles, (ii) energy-filtered  imaging of thin films and
              nanoparticles, (iii) quantitative  electron diffraction nmeasurements,a nd (iv)
              facilitating the  teaching of electron microscopy and microanalyis of
              materials.  ***
