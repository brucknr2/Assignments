Abstract    :
              This study is the conduct and analysis of typical manufacturing                
              plants to determine their use or non-use of some 10-15 production              
              technologies.  It is a follow-up, extension, and improvement of a              
              pilot survey completed earlier.  The National Association of                   
              Manufacturers is cooperating and partially supporting this study.              
              Both "hard and soft" technologies are included.  The sample of                 
              plants is about 5,000 requests to complete the survey form and                 
              include firms or all sizes.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Respondents are asked to indicate their skill level with regard                
              to each technology, reasons for adoption or non-adoption, changes              
              over the recent past, and plans for the near future.  Measures of              
              output will be related to individual production technology used                
              by industry.  Aggregate results to be reported in a report,                    
              professional journals, trade press and the data and information                
              collected (without firm/plant identifiers) to be made available                
              to others
