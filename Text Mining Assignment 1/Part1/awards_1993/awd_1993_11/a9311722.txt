Abstract    :
              9311722  Tan    This project deals with the dynamic response of coupled
              guide/chain drive systems commonly employed for transmitting power to
              automobile accessories, and the feasibility of active and passive vibration
              control of chains operating at high speeds. A distributed transfer function
              approach is used in the analysis for prediction of system response. The passive
              impedance of the distributed guide is based upon an impact pair model. the
              coupled mechanical system, consisting of the guide and the chain, is modeled as
              an assembly of subsystems. An active control, strategy applied at the boundary
              of the guide system is used to suppress the vibration generated during high
              speed motion. The robustness of the active controller at different loading
              conditions is also investigated. The results of this research provide useful
              guidelines for optimization of high-speed axially moving mechanical systems in
              general, and guided chain systems in particular.  0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
