Abstract    :
              9311508  Holmes    Alarm calls are vocalizations elicited by predators that can
              alert other members of the species  to impending danger.  Alarm calls have
              functional value only if they are responded to  appropriately for the type of
              predator.  Ms. Jill M. Mateo's doctoral-dissertation research  seeks to
              determine when and how responses to alarm calls develop in young Belding's 
              ground squirrels, as her pilot data show that alarm-call responses are not
              fully developed  when young ground squirrels first emerge from the burrow where
              they were born.    Ms. Mateo will test three predictions about the relative
              importance of auditory experience  and social context for the development of
              alarm-call responses:  (1) experience with the  mother's vocalizations before
              weaning helps the young to discriminate alarm calls after  weaning; (2)
              development of alarm-call responses after weaning is socially facilitated by 
              observing adult alarm-call responses, and (3) the quality of juvenile
              alarm-call responses  improves rapidly if they repeatedly hear alarm calls in
              the presence of other responding  individuals.  These predictions will be
              tested by playing back tape-recordings of alarm calls  and recording the
              cardiac responses of unweaned pups and the behavioral responses of  juveniles
              housed in a semi-natural environment or living in the field.  Results will help
               explain how social influences contribute to the development of a critical
              survival skill, and  will advance our understanding of how behavior develops
              through tightly-woven interactions  between the organism and the series of
              environments it encounters throughout its life.
