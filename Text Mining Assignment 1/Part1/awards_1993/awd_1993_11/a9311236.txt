Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Polar Cap Observatory (PCO) is considered essential for               
              continued progress in understanding the Sun's influence on the                 
              structure and dynamics of our planet's atmosphere.  An essential               
              first step to the establishment of the PCO is the development of               
              infrastructure in Resolute Bay, Northwest Territories, Canada, and             
              to conduct preliminary scientific investigations in Resolute Bay.              
              The PIs propose to provide the necessary infrastructure to begin               
              the Early PCO (EPCO) phase.  This includes a building with                     
              laboratory space, optical domes and living quarters, along with                
              road construction and installation of power lines.  The PI will                
              also provide a spaced-receiver scintillation detector and                      
              ionospheric drift monitor and a frequency-agile radar for                      
              preliminary scientific investigations.  These investigations will              
              focus on polar cap E fields, plasma structure, polar cap auroral               
              arcs, and polar mesospheric echoes.  In addition, the proposed                 
              infrastructure would be capable of supporting instruments proposed             
              by other researchers that might include a spectrometer,                        
              interferometer, photometer, magnetometer, digisonde, riometer, MF              
              radar, ST radar, and others.
