Abstract    :
              9311335  Clarke    This is a proposal to investigate the conditions under which 
              politically significant charges can occur in the structure and  composition of
              party systems in contemporary democracies.  The  study is prompted by the
              observation that the party systems of  several of these countries have
              experienced substantial partisan  dealignment since the mid 1960's.  Such
              dealignments, together with  important social-structural and cultural changes
              and the emergence  of new issue agendas, seemingly create conditions propitious
              for  the development of new parties and associated party system  realignments. 
              To date, however, there have been only very limited  changes in the basic
              contours of existing party systems, and new  parties that have emerged have
              enjoyed only very limited and often,  short-lived success.  The project in
              study factors which facilitate  and inhibit the emergence of new parties and
              party system  realignment through a coordinated combination of cross-sectional 
              and panel surveys of the Canadian electorate and members, through  a
              coordinated combination of cross-sectional and panel surveys of  the Canadian
              electorate and members, activists and local officials  in Canada's new Reform
              Party.  The surveys will be conducted over  the 1993-1995 period, and a
              book-length manuscript on the research  is expected to be completed in 1996.
