Abstract    :
                   Fiber damage is a major problem in injection molding and                  
              extrusion.  The full benefit of fibers as a reinforcement is not               
              attained in these processes because the fibers are reduced to a                
              fraction of their original length.  Prior research have examined               
              the damage mechanisms with the aim of understanding how the process            
              can be changed to maintain longer fibers.  It is clear that it is              
              the exposure of the fibers to the melt, machinery and other fibers             
              that cause fiber damage, although the extent of each process has               
              not been investigated thoroughly.  Tailored experiments will be                
              performed to reveal the mechanisms of fiber damage.  Experiments               
              will be performed to examine addition of the initial material in               
              different forms, such as powder resin/fibers, encapsulated pellets             
              with different aspect ratios; addition of the fibers separate from             
              the resin in different zones and the processing conditions in the              
              resulting fiber degradation.                                                   
                   The potential impact if this research is large since it will              
              directly impact injection molding and extrusion which are high                 
              volume processes.  Reduced fiber damage implies that the strength,             
              stiffness and impact properties of components made with these                  
              processes will be considerably higher than the present state of the
