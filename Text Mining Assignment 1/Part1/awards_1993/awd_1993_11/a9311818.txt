Abstract    :
              9311818  Bringi    Description:  This project supports  participation by U.S.
              scientists in a U.S.-Indo  workshop and discussion on atmospheric  technology
              to be held in March 1994 at the  Indian Institute of Technology in Bangalore, 
              India.  The goals are: 1. to identify key  advances in atmospheric technology
              that can be  applied to the Indian context, 2. to explore  establishment of a
              modern rainfall ground-truth  site in India for a Tropical Rainfall 
              Measurement Mission (TRMM) validation program,  and 3. to identify areas of
              mutual interest for  possible collaboration in atmospheric research  and
              instrumentation.  The technical sessions  will include topics in: weather
              radars, wind  profilers, advanced instruments for atmospheric  and surface
              measurements, mesoscale meteorology  and cloud physics, and aviation
              meteorology,  and hazards.  a proceedings will be published.    Scope:  The
              project is expected to include  scientists from Colorado State University and 
              from NCAR.  Also, at least one other USG agency  is expected to support its
              staff's  participation.  The study of the monsoon over  India is crucial to
              that country, and is also  very important to other countries around the  world,
              because of the impact of the monsoon on  the weather in other regions.  This
              planned  meeting will follow a similar binational  meeting held in December
              1986.  It is receiving  strong support from the Government of India.   This
              project meets the objectives of the  Division of International Programs.  ***
