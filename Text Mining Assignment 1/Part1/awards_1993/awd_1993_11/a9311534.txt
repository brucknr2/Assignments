Abstract    :
              9311534   Crum       The Virginia Tidewater Consortium for Higher Education
              (VTC)  and public television station WHRO-TV request hardware, software,  and
              communications support to connect VTC LINK to SURAnet.  A  direct connection to
              SURAnet will provide researchers, faculty,  staff and students at VTC member
              institutions with improved  access to national and international networks such
              as NSFNET,  ESnet, NSI, and a whole host of other information resources 
              available via the Internet.       For some VTC member institutions,
              particularly the community  colleges, this connection represents the only
              method of accessing  the Internet.  By linking VTC LINK to SURAnet, the VTC and
              WHRO-  TV propose to set an example for other higher education consortia  of
              individual community colleges interested in working with their  local public
              television stations to establish similar  connections.       The connection,
              once in place, will greatly facilitate  collaborative research efforts
              involving community colleges, four  year institutions of their education and
              research organizations  such as CEBAF (the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator
              Facility)  and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.       In addition to VTC
              LINK, WHRO-TV operates two other  telecomputing systems, VA.PEN and Learning
              Link, serving the  kindergarten through 12th grade educational community.  A
              side  benefit of the SURAnet connection will be the inclusion of K-12  teacher
              and student, when appropriate, in the above mentioned  projects.  ***
