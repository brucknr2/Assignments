Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Several types of geophysical observations indicate that the                    
              lithosphere in the southcentral Pacific is undergoing diffuse                  
              north-south extension.  As a partial test of this hypothesis, the              
              Principle Investigator will survey a previously uncharted series of            
              en-echelon ridges that extend for 2500 km from the East Pacific                
              Rise to the northern edge of the Tuamotu archipelago.  A major                 
              implication of the stretching hypothesis is that some volcanic                 
              activity in the west Pacific may be related to tensional failure of            
              the lithosphere rather than numerous mantle plumes.  The goals of              
              the survey are to first establish that the ridges exist where they             
              have not been charted, and that they are continuous.  The ridges               
              will also be dredged for petrologic and age studies, and the                   
              magnetic signature of the ridges will be determined.
