Abstract    :
              9311436  Gower, S.  The Kemp Natural Resources Station, a research center
              operated by  the University of Wisconsin-Madison's College of Agricultural and 
              Life Sciences, is located in north-central Wisconsin.  The  station has several
              unique characteristics: (1) It is located  near some of the few remaining large
              tracts of old growth forests  int he easter United States, (2) It is located in
              a region that  contains diverse landforms that are juxtaposed in complex 
              patterns, (3) The proximal location of Keep to Trout Lake Station  offer an
              excellent opportunity to examine interactions between  terrestrial and research
              and undergraduate/graduate training  scale.  Keep has a long history as a
              center for community  ecology, wildlife ecology, plant pathology and
              entomology.   Current research programs include biological and physical 
              sciences such as terrestrial ecosystem ecology, ecophysiology,  restoration,
              and landscape ecology; and involve scientists from  UW-Madison and other UW
              campuses, USFS, USGS, and several  American and Canadian universities.  Despite
              recent and ongoing  improvements to both physical structure and research
              capabilities  at Keep Station, the laboratory facilities are not adequate to 
              meet current and future demands.  This project will support the  remodeling and
              expansion of the existing research laboratory and  the purchase an image
              analysis system.  The modernization of the  laboratory will re-establish Keep
              Natural Resources Station as a  center for terrestrial research and promote
              inter-disciplinary  research on terrestrial-aquatic interaction with scientists
              at  Trout Lake Station -- a center for aquatic research.  ***
