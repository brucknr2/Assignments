              Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester will purchase a pulsed laser
              system and an electron beam deposition unit that will be dedicated to support r
              esearch in engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including in particular: 1)the fabrication and investigation of
              circularly symmetric grating, surface emitting semiconductor lasers, 2) new
              materials and epitaxial structures for advanced semiconductor lasers, 3)
              epitaxial layer disordering in III V Heterostructures, and 4) avalanche
              processes in semiconductors and gain coupled semiconductor lasers for
              applications in optoelectronics. ***
