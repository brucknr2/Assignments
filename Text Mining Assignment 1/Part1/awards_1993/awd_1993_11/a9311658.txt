Abstract    :
              9311658  MacKnight    Recent preliminary results have demonstrated complex
              formation  between sulfonated polystyrene ionomers and oil-soluble surfactants 
              in non-polar media resulting in the formation of a new type of 
              nonstoichiometric polyelectrolyte-oppositely charged surfactant  complex which
              is soluble in some low-polarity solvents.  The  proposed research will be
              devoted to two subjects:  an  investigation of complexation between ionomers
              and oil-soluble  surfactants and the study of the structure and properties of
              such  complexes in non-polar media; and synthesis, investigation of  structure
              and properties of novel nonstoichiometric  polyelectrolyte-water soluble
              surfactant complexes with a  slight  excess of non-complexed polyelectrolyte
              ionic groups.    The study of the influence of the chemical structure of
              ionomer and  surfactant and their initial aggregation state on complexation and
               the structure of the aggregates will provide a basis for     quantitative
              modeling of ionomer-surfactant interactions in non-  polar media. The
              experimental approach to the characterization of  the aggregates will include
              viscometry, sedimentation velocity,  dynamic, and static light scattering as 
              well as x-ray scattering.   Differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic
              mechanical and  dielectric relaxation will be used to determine properties for 
              these complexes in non-polar solutions and in the bulk.  ***
