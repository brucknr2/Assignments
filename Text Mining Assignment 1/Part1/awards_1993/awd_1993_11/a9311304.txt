Abstract    :
              9311304  Herrnkind   The purpose of this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant
              is to   investigate a non-trophic indirect interaction between a predatory
              marine   gastropod and an assemblage of benthic fish that shelter and lay eggs
              in the   shells of the gastropod's main prey, the pen shell Atrina. As a major
              source of   Atrina mortality, the gastropod should influence shelter
              availability, and thus   indirectly affect species occupying the shells. Since
              the fish also use the shells   as a site for reproduction, the gastropod
              predator may influence both population   distribution and egg production. This
              study will assess the relationship between   Atrina and each fish species by
              experimentally varying pen shell mortality rates,   and separately measuring
              factors that should influence Atrina mortality, namely   abundance and
              individual feeding rates of the gastropod predator.  %%%  This information will
              allow a quantitative evaluation of the interaction between   the predator and
              the fish occupants in terms of local abundance and   reproductive output.
              Understanding how interspecific interactions influence   populations and
              communities has been a major goal of ecological research.   Direct
              predator-prey and competitive interactions are widely studied. Indirect  
              interactions have received less attention, but evidence for their importance is
                growing. This study will contribute important information towards a better  
              understanding of the role of indirect interactions in the abundance and  
              distribution of aquatic organisms.  ***
