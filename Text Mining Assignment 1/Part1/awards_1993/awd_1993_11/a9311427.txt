Abstract    :
              9311427  Koropchak  This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
              is for the development and characterization of an ultrasensitive, universal
              detector based on condensation nucleation light scattering.  The detector will
              be coupled with chromatographic separation techniques that provide molecular
              specificity.  The detection mechanism involves the creation of an aerosol from
              the chromatographic column effluent, removal of the mobile phase solvent,
              followed by condensation nucleation with argon which increases the analyte
              particle size to about 10 micrometers.  This produces very effective light
              scattering particles, and significantly enhances the sensitivity of the
              detector.  This device could be a universal detector for both HPLC and SFC. 
              %%%  Professor Koropchak and his students will investigate the potential
              applications of an aerosol-based, universal detector for liquid and
              supercritical fluid chromatography.  ***
