Abstract    :
              9311811  Pullin    An investigation will be carried out of the relation between 
              small scale vortex structures and the large scale energy  containing eddies
              typical of turbulence. A model of this  relationship has been developed and is
              to be extended and  applied. The approach is through small scale vortices which
              can  be re-oriented, stretched, or compressed driven by the  distortions of the
              large scale motion.  A Large Eddy Simulation  model results from this approach.
              It will be tested against  Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent channel
              flow.    This research is an attempt to use the known deterministic  governing
              equations as a basis for turbulence models, rather  than ad hoc closure
              assumptions. This can lead to a more  reliable turbulent flow modeling
              capability with greater range  of applicability.  ***
