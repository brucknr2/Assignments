Abstract    :
              This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                    
              Program of the Chemistry Division is involved with a study of                  
              electronic non-adiabatic effects in state-to-state chemical                    
              reaction dynamics.  Considerable use is being made of massively                
              parallel supercomputers.  Special attention is being played to                 
              the role of the "geometric phase" in influencing the reaction                  
              probabilities for such reactions as that between a hydrogen                    
              atom and a hydrogen molecule.

              The theoretical description of very simple gas-phase chemical                  
              reactions such as that between a hydrogen atom and a hydrogen                  
              molecule is being advanced in this computational study which                   
              makes use of the latest in supercomputers.
