Abstract    :
              9311834  Schmelz       The physical properties of the highly ionized plasma of
              the  solar corona will be investigated using soft X-ray spectral line  data
              previously acquired by the Solar Maximum Mission satellite.   The soft X-ray
              lines provides the redundancy to untangle various  observational and
              theoretical effects, and to test current ideas  about the properties of the
              coronal component of solar active  regions.  Current analysis methods assume
              that the observed plasma  is optically thin, that the elemental abundance
              values are  constant, than the theoretical behavior of the emissions lines is 
              a well known function of temperature, and that the plasma is  isothermal.  The
              analysis methods developed for this investigation  do not require these
              restrictions.  Several undergraduate students  will be involved in the projects
              to assist with the data analysis  and present the results.  ***
