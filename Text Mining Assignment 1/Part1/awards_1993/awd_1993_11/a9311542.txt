Abstract    :
                   PIs and collaborators will attempt to extract DNA from                    
              preserved cells in an exquisitely preserved skeleton of the Upper              
              Cretaceous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex, from the Hell Creek                     
              Formation of Montana.  Within vascular canals and in the marrow                
              cavities of leg bones, PIs have found spherical structures that                
              have the appearance of nucleated red blood cells.  Preliminary                 
              analyses of these structures indicate the presence of proteins and             
              nucleic acids.  An attempt will be made to extract DNA from these              
              apparent red blood cell remnants.  If successful, these results                
              could be of great significance to our understanding of dinosaur                
              phylogeny, and will also be of great interest to the growing                   
              community of scientists attempting to extract DNA from fossil                  
              material.
