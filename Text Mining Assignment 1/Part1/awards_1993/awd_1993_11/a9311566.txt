Abstract    :
              9311566  Shen  High energy resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements 
              will be carried out on high quality single crystal samples.  Doping  of the
              samples will allow to vary Tc.  The photoemission studies  are aimed at
              understanding the gap anisotropy in HTS materials  where an improved energy and
              angular resolution will be utilized.   The study of Bi2212 will be extended to
              YBCO, TI2212, TI2201, and  NCCO.  Studies of the normal state will correlate
              the results of  photoemission measurements with transport data aimed at 
              understanding the doping behavior of Mott insulators.  High  efficiency core
              level photoemission spectroscopy will be used to  investigate changes in the
              local electronic structure due to the  opening of the superconducting gap.  The
              proximity effect studied  near normal metal/superconductor interfaces and
              ferromagnetic  materials will be investigated with respect to the role of
              oxygen  in determining differences in the electronic structure of  transition
              metals and transition metal oxides.  %%%  Photoemission is a powerful
              experimental tool in which impinging  radiation leads to the ejection of
              electronic carriers from a  solid.  Measurement of the energy and angle of
              emission can yield  important information about the electronic structure of the
              solid.   The photoemission technique has proved to be an excellent technique 
              to study the electronic properties of high temperature  superconductors.  In
              the present study the technique is extended to  various different materials
              which are available as very high  quality single crystal samples.  A much
              improved spectrometer will  be employed in this work.  The technique will be
              extended to other  materials, notable ferromagnetic solids.  Of particular
              interest  will be to compare transition metals such as nickel and iron with 
              their respective oxides.  ***
