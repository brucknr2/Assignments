Abstract    :
              9311749  Marshall         The objective of this research is to see if the charge
              on  precipitation is primarily responsible for the electricity in 
              thunderstorms.  Toward this end, the investigators propose to  analyze data of
              the charge, size, and two-dimensional shape of  precipitation particles
              collected inside ten Florida thunderstorms  during the 1991 Convection and
              Precipitation/Electrification  Experiment (CaPE).  These data are especially
              important because of  the measurements in the temperature range from -5o to
              -20oC; this  region has not been well studied despite suggestions that much of 
              the charge in storms is generated there.  From the shape  measurements the
              proposers can determine the type of precipitation  particle:  raindrop,
              snowflake, hailstone, or graupel.  They can  then determine the polarity and
              amount of charge carried on  different types of particles.  The PIs will
              collaborate with  colleagues at the National Center of Atmospheric Research
              (NCAR) to  look for influences on particle charges by temperature, cloud 
              liquid water content, cloud particle types and numbers, updrafts  and
              downdrafts, position in the cloud, etc.  They will compare the  electric fields
              measured by the sailplane to the electric field  expected from the measured
              particle charges; comparable fields will  suggest the precipitation carries
              most of the charge in that part  of the storm.  The PIs will collaborate with
              NCAR colleagues and  other CaPE researchers using radar data to place the
              precipitation  measurements in their correct storm context by superimposing 
              sailplane tracks on reflectivity data and on wind fields from  multiple Doppler
              radar analyses.  ***
