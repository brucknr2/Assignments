Abstract    :
              9311643  El-Shall  In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, El-Shall will apply new techniques to study  cationic 
              polymerization in clusters and in the gas phase.  The  different reaction 
              pathways and mechanisms following ionic  initiation in van der Waals clusters
              of  olefins will be  characterized, and the resulting polymeric ions will be  
              identified.  Rate information on related gas-phase reactions  will be studied
              by  ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) and  high-pressure mass spectroscopy.  New 
              initiation mechanisms  involving transition metal ions and charge-transfer will
               also  be explored.  %%%  This project involves the study of chemical processes
               in which  reagent molecules (called monomers) react to continually add 
              together  to form what eventually becomes a very large molecule,  called a
              polymer.   Polymers have considerable commercial  application in such diverse
              areas as  plastics and textiles.  This work will investigate the reaction steps
              involved  in  selected polymerization processes and will attempt to find new 
              mechanisms  by which polymers with desirable properties, such  as electrical
              conductivity,  can be produced.  The results of  these studies may impact
              important commercial  processes.  ***
