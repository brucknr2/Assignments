Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT --- CTS-9311848  Controlled thermal combustion offers the potential as
              an effective treatment process for the disposal of organic hazardous chemical
              wastes.  Senkan and Gutman have developed an approach which they refer to as
              their integrated macroscopic-microscopic program and it is proposed to expand
              this work to the study of chlorinated C3 alkanes, alkenes and dichlorobenzene
              with particular attention given to isomer specific reactions.  Senkan will have
              cognizance over the macroscopic program in which CHC's are burned in a flat
              flame configuration or in heated flow reactors for the determination of
              concentration profiles of reactants, intermediates and products.  Specifically,
              concentration profiles of the major and minor intermediates in the combustion
              of 1-C3H7Cl, 2-C3H7Cl, CH2CHCH2Cl, CH2CClCH3, CHClCHCH3, and o-, p-, and
              m--C6H4Cl2 at one atmosphere will be determined.  These data will be used to
              develop Detailed Chemical Kinetic Mechanisms (DCKM) describing the combustion. 
              The microscopic portion of the program will be undertaken by Gutman, using
              laser photolysis and photoionization mass spectrometry to study individual
              elemental reactions of chlorine-containing free radicals and of atoms and free
              radicals with chlorine-containing stable reaction intermediates and products. 
              In addition computational studies of the rates of  individual elemental
              reactions using quantum mechanical and SAR techniques will be conducted. 
              Sensitivity analysis will be used to determine new rank-order of reactions.
