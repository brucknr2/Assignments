Abstract    :
              9311928  Hamilton    Darwin offered "sexual selection" as an explanation for a
              wide variety of traits having in  common the paradoxical quality of being
              apparently detrimental to survival.  He proposed  that such traits have evolved
              because they give an advantage to the bearer in competing for  or attracting
              mates.  Sexual selection is now widely regarded to be a major mechanism for 
              the evolution of differences between the sexes and a potentially important
              factor in the  evolution of new species.  Yet little is known about the
              mechanisms underlying sexual  selection, the factors constraining it, or the
              nature of variation in sexually selected traits.   Mr. Gregory F. Grether's
              doctoral-dissertation research will address several of these issues  in a model
              invertebrate system, the rubyspot damselfly.  Mr. Grether has obtained evidence
               that the red-pigmented spots at the base of the males' wings are sexually
              selected.  He now  will conduct a series of experiments to (1) determine the
              effect of wing-spot variation on  interactions between males, (2) test for
              female mate preferences, (3) measure ecological costs  of the wing spot in
              terms of conspicuousness to predators and prey, and (4) investigate the 
              relationship between wing-spot variation and male quality as assessed by
              deviations from  bilateral asymmetry.    Mr. Grether has demonstrated
              outstanding depth of understanding of sexual-selection theory  and has
              developed an experimental system with the potential to produce unequivocal
              results  for tests of the theory.
