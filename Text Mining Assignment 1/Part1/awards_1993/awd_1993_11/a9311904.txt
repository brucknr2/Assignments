Abstract    :
              9311904  Christou         This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
              and   Organometallic Chemistry Program, will continue studies of   polynuclear
              transition metal carboxylate complexes.  Three   areas will be emphasized:  1)
              characterization and synthetic   elaboration of a newly discovered cobalt
              cubane complex, 2)   high nuclearity manganese complexes with emphasis on  
              elucidation of the mechanism of magnetic interactions in high   spin state
              species, and 3) synthesis and spectroscopic   characterization of dinuclear
              rhodium and molybdenum   carboxylate complexes of guanine and adenine bases. 
              This work   is expected to impact several areas including biology and  
              materials science.  %%%  This project involves the design, synthesis, and
              physical and   chemical characterization of new transition metal complexes.   
              Information obtained in these fundamental studies is expected   to ultimately
              impact a wide range of other disciplines   including biology and materials
              science.  ***
