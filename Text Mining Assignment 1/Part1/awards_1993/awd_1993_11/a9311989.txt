Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is intended to be the second year of a previous two-year             
              continuing grant (PI: Robert Palmer, Institution: Clemson                      
              University); the grant has been transferred to the University of               
              Nebraska.                                                                      
                                                                                             
                   The objective of this work is the use of the MU radar (49.5               
              MHz) in Kyoto, Japan, configured as an interferometer, to                      
              investigate those processes which appear to cause a "tilting" of               
              refractive index structures.  Such tilted layers produce                       
              differences in the measured vertical velocity using Doppler                    
              techniques.  By using the MU radar as both a Doppler device and an             
              interferometer, these thin scattering layers can be observed                   
              simultaneously, thus producing independent measurements of the                 
              entire field of motion.
