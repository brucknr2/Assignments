                      9311705 Stanford Established in 1899, the Flathead Lake Biological
              Station (FLBS) has a long tradition of field based education and research, with
              emphasis in limnology.  FLBS has a 15 member staff and an annual budget of
              $700,000 (50% extramural).  Since 1983, over $2 million has been invested by
              the State in new housing, labs and equipment.  Two professorships and technical
              support positions (Data Manager and Assistant Director for Operations) were
              added in fiscal year 1992.  Recent research has addressed on groundwater
              ecology (1987 90) and food webs of oligotrophic lakes (1990 93) have been added
              to the stations array of facilities.  Collaborative studies involv e visiting
              investigators from around the world and encompass many aspects of limnology,
              from organism level work on the phenology and genetics of stream biota to
              ecosystem level examinations of materials flux in large lakes and river
              floodplains.  To enhance research capability, this project will retrofit and
              improve the lake and stream water delivery system to the Elrod Laboratory.  The
              present approach is to supply water from the epilimnion and hypolimnion of
              Flathead Lake, and from a springbrook on the Station grounds, in order to
              provide an array of sources, temperatures and food supplies to biota confined
              in laboratory microcosms within existing wet rooms.  Also requested is new
              instrumentation (CHNS analyzer, scintillation counter, 2 research microscopes,
              ion chromatograph, field fluorometer) to replace outdated units.  These items
              are required for continuation of long term limnological data bases and growth
              of multi investigator research. ***
