Abstract    :
              9311580  Machta  This proposal concerns the statistical physics of complex and 
              disordered systems. In particular it concentrates on three areas.  1) A theory
              of phase transitions in porous media with wide  distributions of pore sizes is
              being developed using Migdal-  Kadanoff approximations. The PI is particularly
              interested in  studying the 4helium superfluid transition in porous aerogel 
              glasses. 2) The PI proposes to study a clean example of self-  organized
              criticality - that of the lambda transition in 4helium in  the presence of heat
              flow. 3) The PI plans to study the application  of computational complexity
              theory (something which arose out of  theoretical computer science) to problems
              in statistical physics by  determining the time requirements (and therefore the
              algorithmic  choice) to solve various models on parallel machines.  %%%  The
              proposed work involves theoretical and computational approaches  to the
              understanding of phase transitions in disordered systems. Of  particular
              interest is the understanding of how helium undergoes  its superfuid transition
              in a porous medium - the long wavelength  fluctuations which are usually
              present in such transitions are  truncated by the presence of the pore cages.
              Another aspect of this  work concerns the study of a metastable system; that of
              the so-  called lambda-transition in helium in the presence of heat flow.  This
              produces a clean example for the study of self-organized  criticality - a
              concept which has been applied to phenomena as  varied as stock-market pricing
              and earth-quake prediction. Lastly,  the proposal attempts to classify various
              models for phase  transitions according ideas that came out of theoretical
              computer  science - ideas that concern how difficult, computationally, it is 
              to solve these models.  ***
