              Abstract  ATM-9311858  Cole, J.E.  Title:  The Record of ENSO in the Warm Pool
              of the Western Pacific:  Multi-century Reconstruction from the Geochemistry of
              Long-lived  Corals    The western Pacific warm pool provides a major source of
              water  vapor and energy to the global atmosphere and is a "center of  action"
              for the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system, whose  signal permeates the
              global record of interannual climate  variability.  ENSO warm extremes
              originate from the region, and the  western Pacific convection anomalies
              associated with ENSO propagate  climate variability throughout the tropics and
              the world.  This  award supports a project that will reconstruct multi-century 
              records of variability in the ocean/atmosphere of the western  equatorial
              Pacific, using geochemical records from the skeletons of  long-lived corals. 
              The study will extend the limited record to  ENSO to span the past few
              centuries along an equatorial transect  from the region of the date line into
              the heart of the western  Pacific warm pool.  The resulting records will
              provide a new  understanding of long-term temporal and spatial variability of
              ENSO  and its relation to variations in the western Pacific warm pool and  to
              external forcings, including the regional response to the Little  Ice Age.  The
              proposed paleoclimatic study will place the  TOGA/COARE observations in a
              long-term perspective and delineating  the range of natural variability that
              models must aim to simulate.
