              Academy of Sciences.  The researchers are                                      
              investigating the properties of electrons,                                     
              atoms, and molecules in radiation fields.  Over                                
              the past year, they have performed theoretical                                 
              studies of coherent optical pulse propagation,

              processes, the effects of laser fluctuations and                               
              noise on photo-absorption and emission, the                                    
              theory of atom-field interactions in the context                               
              of cavity QED and phase representations for                                    
              radiation fields.  They have also worked on                                    
              short-pulse studies of diatomic molecules,
