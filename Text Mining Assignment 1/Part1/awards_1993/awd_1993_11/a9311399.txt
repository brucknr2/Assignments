Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Division's Office of Special Projects makes this                 
              award to Purdue University to support a second Workshop for                    
              underrepresented minority undergraduate chemistry majors. The                  
              Workshop will be held on July 9-11,1993. The previous                          
              first-of-its-kind Workshop was extremely successful at elicting                
              the opportunities available to individuals who pursue advanced                 
              study in chemistry. The objective continues to be to bring                     
              minority students from throughout the USA together with                        
              high-achieving minority mentors from industry, academia and                    
              government in order to introduce the students to the                           
              opportunities created by obtaining a Ph.D degree in Chemistry.                 
              The Workshop will also include opportunities for the student                   
              participants to visit advanced research laboratories and to                    
              meet graduate students.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              This Workshop will provide underrepresented minority students                  
              with the opportunity to meet peer mentors who have shared the                  
              same obstacles in their lives and education. These contacts are                
              intended to continue throughout their academic careers and                     
              hopefully, well into their professional lives.
