Abstract    :
              9311496  Hutchins    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   Culture is a process that makes available to humans resources for  the
              organization of behavior.  This organization is accomplished  via both learned
              internal cognitive structures and created social  and material structures in
              the environment.  Until recently, the  cognitive sciences have not had very
              good conceptual tools for  describing the interaction of individual behavior
              and  culturalprocess.  The P.I. is engaged in a project which uses  computer
              simulations to complement theories of culture and  cognition via modelling the
              properties of groups of interacting  learning agents.  By taking the group as a
              unit of analysis-both  here and in the real-world study of cognition-the
              investigator has  made important progress toward a theory which reunites social
              and  material mediators of individual behavior with traditional  individual
              cognitive properties.  The P.I. proposes establishing a  dedicated research
              project centered on simulations of cultural  process for the purpose of
              elaborating this theory.
