Abstract    :
              9311215  Wickert    In this project a laser interferometry system is developed
              for  conducting experimental research in the areas of vibration,  acoustics and
              dynamics. Specific projects include the dynamics of  axially moving materials
              and devices such as high speed magnetic  and magneto-optical tapes, and power
              transmission chairs and  belts. Also, the dynamics of micromechanical
              structures is  investigated to identify the vibration issues that become 
              significant when mechanical structures are significantly down-  sized, for
              instance, through silicon micro-machining techniques.  Characterizing the
              dynamics of such systems is generally  challenging since the fundamental
              vibration frequencies can be  extremely high, with the vibration amplitudes
              being in the sub-  micron range. The interferometer used in the project has a
              laser  spot size between 10 and 100 pem, a bandwidth of a least 500 khz;  and a
              resolution that is variable between 0.008 pem and 20 pem  for displacement
              measurements, and between 0.5 pem/sec and 10  pem/sec for velocity
              measurements. The system provides a reliable  vehicle for obtaining fundamental
              understanding of micro-  mechanical structural dynamics.
