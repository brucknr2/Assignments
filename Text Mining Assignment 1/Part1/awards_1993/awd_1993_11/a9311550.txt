Abstract    :
              Theoretical and numerical studies of subgridscale processes like  topographic
              effects, lateral transport and diapycnal mixing will be  undertaken. The
              emphasis of the study is to develop practical  representation of these
              unresolved processes in global/climate  ocean general circulation models.
