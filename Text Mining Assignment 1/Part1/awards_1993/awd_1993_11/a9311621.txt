Abstract    :
              9311621  Tseng  This research comprises two parts.  The first part concerns  the
              study of certain error bounds for nonlinear programs,  complementarity and
              variational inequality problems, and the  solution of convex inclusions. 
              Roughly speaking, an error  bound is a bound on the distance from a point to
              the solution  set that depends only on some error function evaluated at that 
              point.  The investigation will focus on, though not restricted  to, error
              bounds in which the error function is related to the  solution set.  Such error
              bounds are of interest because they  are the key to analyzing, under minimal
              assumptions on  the problem, the rate of convergence of iterative methods 
              based on fixed point iterations.    The second part of the research concerns
              the design and the  convergence analysis of iterative methods using the above 
              error bounds.  The methods to be studied include the gradient  projection
              algorithm of Goldstein and of Levitin and Polyak,  coordinate descent methods,
              the proximal point algorithm,  operator-splitting methods, the affine-scaling
              algorithm for  semi-finite linear programming, and new methods motivated by 
              error bounds.  ***
