Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, a dilution refrigerator will be used to reach                 
              and maintain in large static magnetic fields temperatures less                 
              than 25 milliKelvin.  It will possess at least 300 microwatts of               
              cooling power at 0.1 Kelvin.  The refrigerator will be used in                 
              research  on "fine structure" phenomena in quasi-one dimensional               
              and quasi-two dimensional conductors.  In particular, several                  
              specific low temperature, high magnetic field, angular-dependent               
              phenomena will be investigated in the organic (super) conductors,              
              in the inorganic, charge-density-wave systems, and in novel                    
              ferromagnetically gated semiconductor heterostructures.                        
                                                                                             
              In the organic superconductor materials, we identify four related              
              electronic and magnetic phenomena unique to these low dimensional              
              materials, the study of which requires the low temperature                     
              environment provided by the dilution refrigerator.  The existence              
              of one of these phenomena has been experimentally verified but                 
              not theoretically explained, two remain in contention, and                     
              another is yet to be investigated.
