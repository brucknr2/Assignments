Abstract    :
                   This award is to support the activities of a Mathematical                 
              Sciences Research Group in Linear Analysis and Probability at                  
              Texas A & M.  The activities of this group (whose fields cover                 
              Banach space theory, probability, operator theory, and operator                
              algebras) are focused by a workshop where graduate students,                   
              postdoctoral students, invited researchers, and the faculty of                 
              the group meet to discuss their ongoing research.  Funds from the              
              grant would go towards the expenses of the workshop, and the                   
              graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in residence.
