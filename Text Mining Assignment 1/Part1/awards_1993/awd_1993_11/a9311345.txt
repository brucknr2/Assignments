Abstract    :
                   The project will investigate the possibility of identifying               
              or formulating a ceramic sol-gel system which will gel when                    
              irradiated by laser radiation.  The aim is to test the feasibility             
              of developing a system that can employ a modification of                       
              conventional stereo lithography equipment to produce rapid                     
              prototypes of ceramic materials utilizing the sol-gel process.                 
              Existing techniques for the rapid prototyping of ceramics, such as             
              Selective Laser Sintering and Three-Dimensional Printing yield                 
              porous and low strength ceramic bodies, whereas the sol-gel process            
              has the potential to produce ceramic bodies with good strength.                
                   The prototyping and testing process represents a major cost               
              of developing applications for ceramic components.  If high                    
              strength ceramic components can be rapidly produced and tested                 
              using the researched technique, the utilization of ceramics in                 
              industrial components may be greatly facilitated.
