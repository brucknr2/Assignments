Abstract    :
              Many research groups have started work on projects to aid in                   
              the use of complex software systems, and to guide non-                         
              specialists in the many choices that have to be made when they                 
              want to use computers for scientific applications.  This                       
              international conference is aimed at bringing together active                  
              researchers working in those areas, to allow for exchange of                   
              ideas, viewpoints and techniques for incorporating expert                      
              systems techniques in scientific computing.
