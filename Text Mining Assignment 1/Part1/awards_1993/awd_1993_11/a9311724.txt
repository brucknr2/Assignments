Abstract    :
              9311724  Perez    Fundamental studies of epitaxial growth of diamond films by 
              chemical vapor deposition (CVD) will be conducted using  scanning tunneling
              microscopy (STM) in ultrahigh vacuum  (UHV), and Raman spectroscopy to
              determine the quality of  the grown films.  It is planned to study, at atomic 
              resolution detail,  the growth of epitaxial diamond films on  natural diamond
              substrates, and the role that hydrogen plays  in growth.  Polycrystalline films
              on other substrates will  also be studied.  The overall objectives include the
              study  of both the nucleation and growth of diamond films, and the  role that
              hydrogen plays in these processes.  %%%  Diamond films have a large number of
              potential applications  due to the unique chemical and physical properties of 
              diamond.  Potential applications for diamond films include  protective
              coatings, heat sinks, optical windows, and  transistors capable of operation at
              high temperature, for  example, at the internal operating temperatures of 
              automobile or airplane engines.  This research is expected  to contribute
              significantly to our fundamental understanding  of the formation of diamond
              films at low temperature and  pressure, and thereby to aid in the development
              of practical  applications of this unique material.  ***
