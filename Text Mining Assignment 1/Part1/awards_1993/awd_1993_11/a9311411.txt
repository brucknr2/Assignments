Abstract    :
              9311411  Weathers  Growth in research activity at the Institute of Ecosystem
              Studies  during the past nine years has put increasing pressure on the 
              analytical laboratory to process rapidly samples from a wide  variety of
              ecosystems whose chemical concentrations vary by  several orders-of-magnitude. 
              This project will upgrade  analytical capabilities by purchasing a new ion
              chromatograph,  total organic carbon analyzer, and high performance liquid 
              chromatograph.  The laboratory currently analyzes samples for  major inorganic
              and organic ions for approximately 14 NSF-  supported projects.  These projects
              are done by scientists from  this institution, as well as outside
              collaborators.  In addition,  the laboratory serves as the primary analytical
              center for  projects funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Mary 
              Flagler Cary Charitable Trust, the USDA, the Hudson River  Foundation and
              others.  Extensive graduate and undergraduate  (through an NSF site and
              supplementary REU grant) student  research is also done in the laboratory.   
              The laboratory currently operates older models of the instruments  with
              severely limited sample capacity.  Some are operational but  incapable of
              meeting the demands of the scientists because they  are either slow, have
              limited sensitivity, or cannot give  accurate results for sample matrices. 
              Currently, one (the  inductively coupled plasma spectrometer) is only
              intermittently  operational.  The instruments to be acquired will make the 
              analytical laboratory more efficient and allow data to be  downloaded directly
              to a PC.  ***
