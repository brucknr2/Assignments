Abstract    :
              9311522  Price  There is non-linear response of the Earth's magnetospheric
              system  to the solar wind.  We propose to determine the degree of this non- 
              linearity as a function of the level of activity and to use the 11  station
              magnetometer records to quantify more completely the nature  of the solar wind
              driver and the nature of the magnetospheric  response.    The degree of
              non-linearity in the magnetospheric response to the  solar wind is controlled
              by the level of magnetospheric activity.   Our primary interest in
              predictability is for the identification of  deterministic non-linear response;
              our interest in predictability  qua prediction is secondary to that.  To
              continue our previous non-  linear analysis, we will analyse the response of
              the magnetosphere  (as given by the 11 auroral oval magnetometer station
              records) to  the solar wind input (given by the parameters v, n, B and 
              calculated from 1 minute resolution ISEE-3 data).  We should be  able to
              identify the solar wind parameters which have the most  effect on the
              magnetosphere and the prevailing pattern of response  of the magnetosphere, as
              observed by the ground station  magnetometers.  Physically, it is likely that
              the present auroral  electroject indices cannot reveal significant dynamical
              information  about electroject dynamics.  We will use the results of this non- 
              linear prediction study to propose a new index based on the data  from the 11
              stations which more accurately represents the solar  wind driven activity in
              the Earth's magnetosphere.  we will  generate the basis function whose
              projection leads to the least  prediction error.  ***
