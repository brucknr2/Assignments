Abstract    :
              9311694  Elliott  This project is in the general area of analytical and surface 
              chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  During the  tenure of this
              thirty-nine month continuing grant, Professor  Elliott and his students will
              investigate various fundamental  and applied chemical aspects of electroactive
              polymers.  Three  thrust areas will be pursued.  In the first, the efficacy of 
              Nafion membrane immobilized ruthenium functionalized porphyrins  on electrode
              surfaces as electrochemical detectors for olefins  will be explored.  In the
              second, poly N-methyl pyrrole  modified electrodes will be evaluated as
              detectors for one- and  two-carbon polychloroalkanes in aqueous solution.  In
              the third  thrust area, new bisbipyridylalkane-based polymers will be  prepared
              and evaluated as robust conducting films for preparing  polymer modified
              electrodes. These materials hold promise as  effective electrocatalytic agents.
               %%%  The successful attainment of the goals of this research could  enable the
              development of new classes of modified electrode  sensors which would be quite
              useful as monitors of  environmentally invasive species.  Additionally, new
              conducting  polymeric materials targeted for synthesis and evaluation in  this
              project are expected to have significant technological  applications.  ***
