Abstract    :
              9311289  Espinosa  The research to be performed in this investigation will
              explore  microcracking and inelasticity of ceramics and glasses; deformation 
              mechanisms occurring at the microlevel when such materials are  subjected to
              high stresses and strain rates; dynamic propagation of  bimaterial cracks;
              critical conditions for crack initiation and  propagation as a function of mode
              mixity; dynamic friction on films  at various temperatures; local inelasticity,
              mircoplasticity and  microcracking in the frictional behavior of interfaces as
              a  function of surface characteristics and lubrication;  thermomechanical
              characterization of smart materials;  identification of initiation sites for
              phase transformations,  incubation times and growth kinetics; and the
              derivation of  multidimensional constitutive models.
