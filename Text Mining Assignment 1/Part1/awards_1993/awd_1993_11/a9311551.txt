Abstract    :
              In this research project, supported by the Analytical and                      
              Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Jacobs will carry out                     
              studies of the dynamics of molecular ion scattering from well                  
              characterized surfaces.  The goal of this work is to explore                   
              the detailed dynamics of charge transfer, energy transfer,                     
              dissociation, and abstraction reactions of molecular ions at                   
              metal and semiconductor surfaces.  State selected molecular                    
              ions are made to collide wth a well characterized solid                        
              surface, and product yields and angle-resolved velocity                        
              distributions are measured in a novel experimental apparatus.                  
              Detailed information about the reaction coordinate for the ion                 
              surface collision can be extracted from these measurements.

              When a molecular ion collides with a surface, a number of                      
              possible processes can occur.  A detailed understanding of                     
              these processes is important to an understanding of electronic                 
              materials processing, space science, and thin film synthesis of                
              novel materials.  This research project explores the detailed                  
              dynamics of ion surface collisions, using state selected                       
              incident ions and state specific detection of scattered ions.                  
              A very complete picture of the ion collision process emerges                   
              from these studies.
