Abstract    :
              9311361   AYERS  This project will examine the objectives of the bail system and
               possible bias in bail by analyzing bail treatment, the likelihood  of flight
              and danger, and bondsmen's rates in Connecticut in the  late 1980's and 1990's.
               It has been difficult to determine whether  or not there is race
              discrimination in the bail system for the  reason that bail may be correlated
              with race because race may be  correlated with some legitimate bail
              determinant.  Research cannot  conclusively determine whether discrimination is
              occurring unless  the researcher can account for all factors that should affect
              bail.  The project avoids this problem by directly examining measures of 
              flight (and rearrest) risk, the outcome(s) that bail seeks to  control.  The
              investigators will then compare the determinants of  both flight and rearrest
              risk.  The project will also use data on  bondsmen's rates to perform a
              market-based evaluation of the bail  system.    The project requires data
              collection, data manipulation and data  analysis.  The data will be collected
              from the Connecticut Judicial  Department, the Connecticut Bail Commission and
              the Connecticut  State Police.  All of these data will require significant
              computer  programming to become machine readable.  The three data sets must 
              also be assembled into a single, coherent data base that will be  suitable for
              the purposes of the study.  Extensive statistical  analysis will then be
              required to answer the research questions.  ***
