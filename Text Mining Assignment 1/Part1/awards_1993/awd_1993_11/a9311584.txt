Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor Smith at the University of Notre Dame to study methods               
              to regulate the binding of small (amino acids, nucleosides,                    
              saccharides) and large (enzymes, glocoproteins) biomolecules to                
              abiotic, boronic acid-based receptors by two avenues. The first                
              involves the synthesis and study of a series of boronic acid                   
              crown ether molecules designed to heterotopically bind and                     
              cotransport water-soluble diol-ligands and metal cations across                
              lipophilic membranes. This approach is based on ionic strength                 
              controlled binding. The second approach involves photoswitchable               
              receptors and is based on the photochemically controlled binding               
              of the biomolecules. The synthetic receptors will be lipophilic,               
              photoswitchable boronic acid azobenzenediol carrier molecules                  
              which will also be explored as light-powered transmembrane proton              
              pumps.                                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project Professor Smith will investigate methods of                    
              regulating the binding of various types of biological ligands to               
              abiotic, boronic acid-based receptors. Both ionic strength                     
              controlled and light controlled binding methods will be                        
              investigated. In the ionic based method the binding to the                     
              heterotopic receptors is controlled by metal ions, while the                   
              light controlled method involves photoswitchable receptors. This               
              research may have technological applications such as                           
              (bio)chemical purification devices, carriers for transport                     
              through lipophilic membranes, and controlled release materials.
