Abstract    :
              9311388  Schwaber    This is a proposal to study the role of nucleus tractus
              solitarii  (NTS) neurons in the transformation and integration of  baroreceptor
              input as part of the system that controls blood  pressure.  The project is very
              important because it provides a  first step towards understanding the neural
              basis of blood  pressure control.  The work is motivated by the striking 
              observation that single baroreceptive NTS neurons do not  reproduce their
              baroreceptor input pattern, and appear to have  nonlinear responses to changes
              in arterial pressure.  These  findings suggest that NTS neuron responses are
              produced by active  membrane responses to baroreceptor inputs.    The plan of
              work follows a logical progression:  in vivo  recording of synaptic inputs and
              postsynaptic responses of NTS  neurons, followed by construction of neuronal
              and network models  of NTS neurons to test whether the experimental data can
              account  for the neurons' responses.  These computational models will be 
              implemented on a parallel computing platform.***
