Abstract    :
              9311241  Moon       The project will support the purchase of a filament-winding 
              machine which will be dedicated to research in engineering.  The  equipment
              will be used for a number of research projects, including  in particular:
              Eliminating Process-Induced Defects in Polymeric  Composite Cylinders,
              Radiation-Initiated Curing/Heating of  Polymeric Composites, Nonlinear Material
              Characterization and  Failure of Composites, Viscoelastic Behavior of Thick
              Laminates in  Compression, and Process-Induced Fiber/Ply-Waviness in Thick- 
              Section Composite Laminates.       An improved understanding of the behavior of
              polymer  composites during manufacturing may help to improve the quality and 
              reduce the cost of these advanced materials.
