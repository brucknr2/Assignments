              Electrical Engineering at the University of Virginia will purchase  Optical
              Instrumentation for Spectral Transmission and Reflection Measurements. The
              requested  optical equipment will be used in conjunction with a new and unique
              measurement technique  which accounts for optical interference in thin films
              and allows us to obtain much more accurate  values of optical constants. This
              equipment will be used together with field effect  characterization equipment
              which we already have. This will allow us, for the first time, to  perform
              field effect and optical studies on the same samples of amorphous silicon and
              establish  the nature and distribution of localized states in amorphous silicon
              as well as the changes in this  distribution under voltage stress and external
              conditions. Such a study is very important for  improving the stability of
              amorphous silicon Thin Film Transistors which determines the  stability and
              quality of Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays widely used in modern computer
               equipment and consumer electronics. It is also important for understanding
              both unique material  properties of amorphous silicon and the TFT device
              physics.
