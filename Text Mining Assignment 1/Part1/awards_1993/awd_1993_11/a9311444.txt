Abstract    :
              9311444  Cross  This proposal is concerned with the theoretical understanding of
               pattern forming systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The PI  is well
              known for his work here and has just finished coauthoring  a long "Reviews of
              Modern Physics" article on the subject. The  techniques used by the PI are
              multifold - varying from linear and  non-linear stability analyses of spatially
              homogeneous states - to  including the effects of defects and boundaries on the
              pattern  evolution - to the numerical investigation of model systems. 
              Specifically, the PI proposes to consider instabilities and paterns  in fluid
              and chemical systems - such as stripe phases, convective  phases and stationary
              periodic chemical patterns. Further, the PI  proposes to study the less
              well-characterized field of patterns in  materials systems - such as
              deformation bands and dislocation  patterns in strained crystals.  %%%  Many
              fluid systems exhibit patterns when they are kept under  conditions away from
              equilibrium. For example, a fluid between hot  (bottom) and cold (top) plates
              exhibits convective patterns.  Similarly, solid materials under applied stress
              (eg shearing) can  develop deformation bands. Such non-equilibrium conditions
              occur  all the time in everyday life (eg the formation of clouds) - and  form
              by far the majority of cases in the processing of materials  (milling, rolling,
              sintering etc). Their study is important in the  understanding of material and
              liquid behavior. This proposal  undertakes a theoretical study of these
              phenomena. The PI is one of  the leading lights in this field and the work is
              at the cutting-  edge of what is known and understood.  ***
