Abstract    :
              9311874  Lee  This project is on research to  develop a very small fermentor
              which  will have sensors for measuring  dissolved oxygen, pH, glucose, and 
              cell density.  In addition, the  glucose sensor would be  oxygen-independent
              and  self-calibrating.  The proposed  micro-scale fermentor will be  designed
              in a form similar to a  microprocessor chip.  This will  enable simple
              connections between  sensors and measurement units which  will reduce cost. 
              The small  fermentor volume and a design  suitable for mass production will 
              also minimize the cost.  This type  of bioreactor device has the  potential to
              significantly reduce  the time and effort involved with  the great number of
              fermentations  used in industrial screening  operations.  ***
