Abstract    :
              9311812  Dunbar  With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and 
              Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research on synthesis  of compounds
              containing heavier transition metals by Dr. Kim R.  Dunbar of the Chemistry
              Department, Michigan State University.  Solvated mononuclear and dinuclear
              complexes with new phosphine  ligands possessing unusual steric or electronic
              properties and  with cyanide or polynitrile will be used as starting materials 
              for the synthesis of unusual or unstable species.  Targeted for  synthesis are
              monomers of iridium, palladium, and platinum  which contain seven d-electrons
              and which might have activity  in radical coupling reactions.  In addition,
              some iron(II)  oligomers will be synthesized, using bulky ether-phosphines to 
              stabilize the structure.  Polynuclear metal nitriles of  molybdenum, rhenium,
              rhodium, manganese and vanadium which may  have unusual magnetic or electronic
              properties will be prepared.  %%%  Some metal ions associated only with solvent
              molecules are  readily available for reaction with other species in solution 
              which are able to substitute for the solvent molecule.  Dr.  Dunbar is able to
              prepare such species for a variety of second  and third row transition metals,
              starting from dinuclear  compounds.  In this project, she will synthesize new 
              solid-state inorganic compounds containing organophosphorus,  organonitrile,
              and cyanide ligands.  This research may result  in new routes to unusual
              materials having useful solid state  properties.  ***
