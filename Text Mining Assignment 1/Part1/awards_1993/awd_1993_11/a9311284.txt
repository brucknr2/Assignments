Abstract    :
              Daniel Joseph  Abstract    A high-speed, digital video system and image
              processing equipment  will be used to support engineering research in
              two-phase-fluid  flows, including:  the measurement of hold-up ratios and 
              eccentricities in water-lubricated flows of viscous materials  (crude oil,
              slurries, and capsules); the determination of an  empirical correlation between
              particle size and sedimentation  velocity in oil-in-water emulsions (which are
              also used for  transporting viscous materials); the study of the
              microstructural  properties of long particles in fluidized suspensions and
              shear  flows; the investigation of blockage effects of finite-size spheres  in
              a monodisperse fluidized bed; and the study of interaction of a  thin liquid
              film on a flat surface subjected to an air shear flow.   ***
