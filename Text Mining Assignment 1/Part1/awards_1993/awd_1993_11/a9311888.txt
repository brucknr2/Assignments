Abstract    :
              9311888  Petrosian       The primary goal of this project is to understand the
              energy  release and particle acceleration mechanisms in solar flares.  It  is
              believed that the source of energy of flares is the current  carrying magnetic
              field and that the bulk of this energy goes into  the acceleration of
              particles.  Most direct information on these  processes comes from microwave,
              hard X-ray and gamma-ray  observations of the impulsive phase of flares, and it
              is through  comparison of these observations with theoretical results that 
              insight can be gained into this important problem.  In the  theoretical aspect
              of this project the goal is to improve the  treatment of the acceleration
              process and unify it with the  transport and radiative aspects.  The model
              results will be  compared with spectral data from solar flares obtained by
              several  spacecraft.  The results from this project will not only be  important
              in the understanding of the flare problem, but will be  useful in other areas
              of high energy astrophysics, such as  magnetospheric phenomena around planets
              and compact stars and in  the nuclei of active galaxies.  ***
