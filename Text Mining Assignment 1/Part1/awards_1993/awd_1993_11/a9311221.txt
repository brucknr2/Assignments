Abstract    :
              The objective of this workshop is to bring together experts                    
              from a broad range of disciplines to carry out an integrated                   
              overview of the excavation industry and its complex                            
              organizational structure, to identify barriers to the adoption                 
              of new technologies as well as opportunities for the adoption                  
              of new concepts and technologies.  One tangible product from                   
              the workshop will be the proceedings which will provide                        
              insights to the policy makers, on achievable technological                     
              and environmental innovations for automated excavation                         
              technology and material handling.
