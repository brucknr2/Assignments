Abstract    :
              During the last few years, major scientific progress has been                  
              achieved in fields related to computer aided analysis of multibody             
              systems.  In view of this progress and recent developments of                  
              computer hardware and general purpose software, there is a need to             
              access the current state of art and results from different schools             
              of thought, with the objective of focusing trends in future                    
              research.  This Advanced Study Institute (ASI) will bring together             
              developers of different segments of these schools of thought as                
              lecturers, with advanced design engineers and researchers as                   
              students, for the purpose of presentation, refinement, and                     
              publication of a comprehensive work on different methodologies in              
              Computer Aided Analysis of Rigid and Flexible Mechanical Systems.
