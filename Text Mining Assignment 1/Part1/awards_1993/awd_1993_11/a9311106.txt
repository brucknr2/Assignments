Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hydrogen will be used in dry and wet medium milling processes in               
              order to embrittle metal surface layer, and consequently                       
              accelerateproduction of granular monocrystals.  A secondary                    
              effect sought in some wet medium processes is the oxidation of                 
              fine grain size, which would stabilize the particle dimension.                 
              The particulate system will be characterized before an after                   
              milling by X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron                         
              microscopy, and compression tests.  The P. I. will explore also                
              the use of other inert gases instead of hydrogen, and different                
              milling geometries including planar milling.                                   
                                                                                             
              The Proposal embrittlement approach, if successful, will reduce                
              the time of milling and increase the uniformity of the granular                
              nanocrystalline materials used in manufacturing and advanced                   
              materials processing.
