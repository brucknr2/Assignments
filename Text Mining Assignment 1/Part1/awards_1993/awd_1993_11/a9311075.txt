Abstract    :
              9311075  Orme       The award is for a high-speed x-y positioning system that
              will  be incorporated in an existing facility which is used in ongoing  work
              supported by NSF to demonstrate the ability to enhance the  microstructure of
              net-formed materials by using the new materials  synthesis technique.  The
              technique involves the generation of  streams of molten metal droplets that are
              directed onto a  temperature controlled substrate where they undergo rapid 
              solidification.  Control of the solidification phenomena leads to  control and
              manipulation of the materials's microstructure.  With  the incorporation of the
              proposed high speed positioning system  the microstructure can be refined to
              exhibit grain sizes on a  nanoscale (with grains < 100nm in at least one
              dimension).       Significant scientific interest is recently directed towards 
              nanophase materials synthesis.  Properties which are associated  with nanophase
              materials such as increased thermal expansion,  reduced density, increased
              strength and specific heat as well as  a supermodulus effect, have given these
              materials numerous new  engineering applications.  The proposed high-speed
              positioning  system will allow the demonstration of the fabrication of
              nanophase  materials with the new materials synthesis technique.
