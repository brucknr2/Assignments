Abstract    :
              The wood rot fungus Dactylium dendroides excretes large amounts of             
              the enzyme galactose oxidase (GOase) into the extracellular                    
              medium1.  GOase has been classified as an alcohol oxidase, using O2            
              to convert primary alcohols (RCH2OH) into aldehydes (RCHO) and                 
              H202. GOase can react with a wide variety of primary alcohols,                 
              includingmany carbohydrates, such as glucose, cellobiose, maltose,             
              lactose, sucrose, and polymeric carbohydrates, including cellulose.            
              Although the oxidase reaction of GOase has been known for decades,             
              the main biological purpose of GOase has always been a puzzle.                 
              Recent work in the Branchaud laboratory indicates that GOase                   
              possesses multiple activities, including an iron reductase                     
              activity.  Fe(II) produced by the iron reductase activity and H202             
              from the oxidase activity could combine to produce hydroxyl                    
              radicals via the Fenton reaction.  The PI proposes that the                    
              principle activity of GOase in nature is to generate hydroxyl                  
              radicals for the purpose of breaking down wood cellulose and other             
              complex polymers.  The research examines and characterizes the                 
              multiple activities of this enzyme.

              Galactose oxidase produces hydroxyl radical, one of the reactive,              
              broad specificity oxidants known.  Such a biocatalyst has potential            
              application in oxidatively degrading complex biomolecules in toxic             
              wastes and in developing more environmentally friendly bleaching               
              technologies.
