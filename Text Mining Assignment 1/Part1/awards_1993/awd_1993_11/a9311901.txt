Abstract    :
              9311901  Locke  This project is on research to  develop a new material for use
              in  electrophoresis and other  bioseparation techniques.  The new  material
              consists of a  polyacrylamide gel with controlled  channels that are formed by
              inducing  gelation around liquid crystalline  DNA solutions.  Once formed, the 
              gels will be characterized  experimentally by measuring rates of  diffusion and
              electrophoretic  migration.  Also, modeling and  computer simulation of the
              transport  processes will be performed.  ***
