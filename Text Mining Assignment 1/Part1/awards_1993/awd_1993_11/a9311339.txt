Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This US-Russia Cooperative Research project on                                 
              the "Use of Soviet Light Modulators in                                         
              Morphological Image Processing" will be carried                                
              out by Dr. David P. Casasent, Carnegie Mellon                                  
              University, and Dr. Anatoliy Vasiliev, Lebedev                                 
              Physical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences.                               
              This proposal concerns new image processing basic                              
              research algorithms and their optical                                          
              implementation on an optical correlator                                        
              architecture fabricated using Russian Spatial                                  
              Light Modulators (SLMs).  Russia has long been a                               
              leader in SLMs.  They are the key devices needed                               
              in optical processors.  The proposal involves the                              
              Russians furnishing the SLM devices and the U.S.                               
              furnishing the algorithms to use these SLMs.                                   
                                                                                             
              This project in morphological image processing                                 
              fulfills the program objectives of advancing                                   
              science by enabling leading experts in the U.S.                                
              and Russia to combine complementary talents and                                
              pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                              
              interest and competence.
