Abstract    :
              9311824  Alexander       The objective of this research are to: (1) develop a
              procedure  for determining optimum process settings for this and other related 
              fill problems; (2) to design and implement an effective automatic  process
              regulation and monitoring scheme for effectively minimizing  the variation in
              this filling process; (3) to recommend basic  filling system design changes
              that will improve the overall filling  operation; and (4) to investigate the
              effect of measurement error  on automatically controlled processes.       The
              research will address two important problem areas with  regard to the pouch
              filling process.  The first involves finding  the optimal values for the
              process mean fill setting and the upper  specification limit such that overall
              profit is maximized.  The  second involves the identification, control, and
              possible  elimination of the sources of variation within the filling process.  
              Since these problems exist in a variety of industries, the success  of the
              research should have wide applications.
