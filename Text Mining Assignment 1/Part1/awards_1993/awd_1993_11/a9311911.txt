Abstract    :
              9311911  Straka       Research tasks that are crucial for advancements in short
              term  weather forecasting are improvements in model initialization and 
              assimilation of data.  An important first step is to develop  methods for
              determining cloud hydrometeor types within storms  through remote sensing.     
               The Principal Investigators will use a variety of information  from advanced
              weather research radars to determine hydrometeor  distribution within
              convective storms.  Using this information, the  Principal Investigators will
              make a first attempt to initialize  moisture fields in a cloud/mesoscale
              numerical weather prediction  model.        Specific objectives include: (1)
              Refine and test an algorithm  designed to deduce precipitating hydrometeor
              types and amounts from  reflectivity, dual-wavelength, polarimetric and Doppler
              radar  measurements; (2) Use precipitation information from radar  measurements
              with combined velocity/thermodynamic/microphysical  retrieval and dynamic
              initialization schemes to initialize  cloud/mesoscale numerical prediction
              model; (3) Test the  sensitivity of numerical model to initialization with
              observed and  retrieved wind, thermodynamic, cloud and precipitation
              information;  (4) examine popular theories on the formation and growth of hail 
              using information from radar analyses.  ***
