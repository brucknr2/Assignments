Abstract    :
              9311029  Wali  Description:  This is a group travel proposal for five U.S. 
              scientists to participate in the S.N. Bose International  Centenary Meeting: 
              Bose and 20th Century Physics, Calcutta, Dec.  30 - Jan. 5, 1994.  The meeting
              will gather together some two  dozen leading physicists from the U.S. and
              Europe to honor one of  India's legendary scientists and one of the most
              prominent  scientists of this century.  The organizers are K.C. Wali,  Syracuse
              University and C.K. Majumdar, the National Bose Centre  for Basic Sciences. 
              Financial supporters include the Indian  Department of Science and Technology,
              the Royal Society of  London, the International Centre for Theoretical
              Physics,Trieste.   Bose made outstanding contributions in the development of
              quantum  theory, in low and high energy nuclear physics, statistical 
              mechanics, superconductivity/ superfluidity, quantum optics,  statistics, and
              organic chemistry.  The program is of very high  quality.  An eminent array of
              speakers will lecture on topics in  particle physics, quantum optics and
              quantum mechanics, general  relativity, statistics, condensed matter physics,
              chemistry.   Scope:  This meeting is an important international event that has 
              attracted scientists from diverse disciplines from all parts of  the world.  A
              large contingent of scientists from Europe, Japan  and the developing countries
              will be present, plus leading Indian  physicists, science policy makers and
              students.  Considering the  international standing of the invited speakers,
              this is an  exceptional opportunity for the exchange of ideas on topics of 
              current interest.  The event will be beneficial for Indian and  non-Indian
              participants.   ***
