Abstract    :
              This project is a travel grant for two researchers to                          
              attend/participate in a planning meeting to establish the                      
              analytical and experimental procedures and data to be obtained                 
              for a full scale experiment of a masonry infilled reinforced                   
              concrete frame building.  The research results will be very                    
              beneficial to the engineering professionals and researchers.
