Abstract    :
              9311950  Shortliffe       This research addresses the problem of modeling time
              in  dynamic domains given incomplete and uncertain information about  the
              domain.  The dynamic network model (DNM) is a time-series model  built on the
              belief-network paradigm that employs classical time-  series methodologies to
              provide a mechanism for making unbiased  forecasts.  Domains exhibiting complex
              cyclical behavior abound in  all fields of science and engineering.  The
              success of dynamic  models in these application domains is contingent on their
              ability  to predict the future cyclical behavior.  Typically, these domains 
              contain uncertainty in the form of noise from perturbations by  unmodeled
              exogenous forces.  An integrated framework will be  provided for modeling
              cyclical behavior an uncertainty.  The  methodology combines Fourier analysis,
              a powerful technique for  modeling periodic functions, and belief networks, an
              expressive  knowledge representation for modeling uncertainty.
