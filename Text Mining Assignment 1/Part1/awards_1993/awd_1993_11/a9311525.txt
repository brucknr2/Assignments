Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a numerical                  
              calculation will be carried out to test the validity of a                      
              scheme for rapidly and efficiently obtaining optimized flows.                  
              The test case will be turbulent flow in a two-dimensional                      
              diffuser. The optimization is to attain the maximum pressure                   
              rise for given inlet conditions and diffuser length. A                         
              conventional engineering turbulence model will be incorporated                 
              into the calculation. The optimized configuration will be                      
              tested with the same model in a continuous validation  as the                  
              optimization scheme proceeds.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Fast optimization methods to maximize or minimize some                         
              performance parameter (pressure, drag), without recourse to                    
              time consuming trial and error, would be of great utility in a                 
              variety of engineering flow systems.
