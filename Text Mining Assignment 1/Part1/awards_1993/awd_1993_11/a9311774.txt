Abstract    :
              9311774  Ibrahim  This award supports Professor Raouf Ibrahim and a graduate 
              student of  Wayne State University to collaborate in mechanical engineering 
              research with Professor Karl Popp and his group at the University  of 
              Hannover, Germany.  They share an interest in the influence of  friction on the
              dynamic behavior of nonlinear systems.  Utilizing  the  expertise of the German
              group, they will conduct experiments to  measure the friction characteristics
              of metallic friction  interfaces  under stationary and non-stationary relative
              rotational motion in  rotating machinery.  This will enable the collaborating
              research  groups to develop friction models with nonlinear and random 
              characteristics.  Then the group at Wayne State will test these  models by
              carrying out analytical and numerical studies of  stick-slip  motions in
              discrete rotating systems.    This research addresses an important group of
              problems related to  vibration and wear in sliding surfaces.  Undesirable
              effects of  instability and friction are common in virtually all machinery  and
               mechanical systems.  The results of this research will enable  these 
              investigators to develop design guidelines for sliding surfaces  free  of
              friction-induced noise. This would be relevant, for example,  to  the design of
              improved rotating bearings for high speed  machinery.  ***
