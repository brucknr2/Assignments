Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a request for a Minority Research Planning Grant by Dr.                
              Ogunwole. He  has designed a set of experiments to collect pilot               
              data that he will subsequently use in  preparation of future                   
              research proposals.  He will focus on the effect of age and diet               
              on insulin regulation of a key enzyme. That key enzyme is                      
              lipoprotein lipase (LPL) whose activity is important in lipid                  
              metabolism. In addition to dietary fat, he will also look at                   
              dietary carbohydrate and influences of both on LPL activities in               
              fed and fasted rats. These studies may help shed light on the                  
              regulatory role of insulin.
