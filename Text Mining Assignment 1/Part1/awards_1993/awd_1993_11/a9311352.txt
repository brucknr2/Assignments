Abstract    :
              Circadian rhythms are an adaptation of organisms to the regular                
              daily change of their environment.  Although much is known about               
              the formal properties of circadian rhythms which allow them to                 
              synchronize to the daily light/dark cycles, almost nothing is known            
              about how these rhythms work on a biochemical level.  This project             
              is two-fold.  First, the simplest organism now known to express                
              circadian rhythms will be used namely, prokaryotic cyanobacteria.              
              Second, genetic tools will be used to analyze its mechanism.  A                
              reporter gene encoding a bioluminescence enzyme has been attached              
              to an endogenous promoter.  Not only does this construct make these            
              cyanobacteria bioluminescent, the glow meets all of the salient                
              criteria of circadian rhythmicity.  This is the first "artificial"             
              overt rhythm of a circadian clock yet described.  This unique case             
              of circadian gene expression is being exploited to: (1) identify by            
              action spectroscopy the photoreceptor involved in the clock's                  
              entrainment; (2) analyze the control pathway by which the circadian            
              clock regulates this " artificial" rhythm; and (3) search for genes            
              which are involved in the clock's central mechanism.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Using a simple bacterial system should accelerate the                          
              identification of cellular mechanisms by which daily rhythms.  Dr.
