Abstract    :
                            9311080  Able, K.  The Rutgers University Marine Field Station is
              located near  Tuckerton, New Jersey, at the mouth of the Mullica River - Great 
              Bay Estuary.  The entire watershed of this estuary is protected  within the New
              Jersey National Pinelands Reserve.  The station  provides easy access to
              extensive salt marsh and estuarine  habitats in the cleanest estuary on the
              northeast coast, and to a  site at 15 m depth on the continental shelf where
              studies on  hydrodynamic processes, sediment resuspension and transport, 
              larval and juvenile settlement and recruitment of commercial  species of fish
              and invertebrates, and bottom boundary layer  prosses affecting benthic
              communities are being conducted.  A  Long-Term Ecosystem Observatory has been
              established at this site  to track episodic and long-term changes in important 
              environmental parameters.    This project will 1) enhance the ability to
              transport and  maintain invertebrates and fishes from the estray and
              continental  shelf under controlled temperatures, and 2) improve data 
              collection at the site on environmental factors fundamental to a  number of the
              studies there, e.g., additional components for an  existing meteorological
              station, a salinometer and a fluorometer.  ***
