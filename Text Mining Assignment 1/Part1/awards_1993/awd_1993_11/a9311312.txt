Abstract    :
              9311312  BIDIGARE      The northern Arabian Sea exhibits regular, predictable
              oscillations  in phytoplankton biomass and production driven by monsoonal 
              atmospheric forcing.  In this project, the principal investigator  will
              characterize phytoplankton pigment distributions during the  Arabian Sea
              Process Study (ASPS) using state-of-the-art high-  performance liquid
              chromatography (HLPC) methods.  There are four  major research objectives. 
              Seasonal and spatial pigment data will  be used (1) to document phytoplankton
              biomass (as chlorophyll-a)  and species composition of pigments and other
              variables and (4) use  the model to estimate time-and-depth-dependent rates of
              primary  production.  This work will complement the efforts of other ASPS 
              investigators studying phytoplankton dynamics both by water column  sampling
              and via satellite imagery.
