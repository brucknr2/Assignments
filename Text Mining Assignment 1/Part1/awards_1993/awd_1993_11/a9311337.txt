Abstract    :
              9311337  Scherer  In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research Project in the 
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry  Division, Scherer
              will interface a scanning tunneling  microscope (STM) with a femtosecond-pulse
              laser system in order  to investigate the temporal and spatial properties of
              atomic  structures on surfaces and at interfaces.  Coherence properties  of
              single molecules and particles adsorbed or chemisorbed to  conducting subtrates
              will be measured.  Pump-probe methods will  be used to obtain tens of
              femtoseconds time resolution of the  photophysical dynamics of the adsorbate
              while the STM serves as  the molecule and site-specific detector of the
              optically  induced changes in conductivity.  %%%  Through the results of
              experiments conducted under this  research program Scherer will obtain a better
              understanding on  a microscopic level of the fundamental properties of
              molecules  confined on surfaces.  The information and broader perspective 
              obtained from these studies have the potential for directly  observing and
              controlling chemical processes at the atomic  level.  This in turn has
              implications for nanoscale fabrication  of materials and other processes which
              occur at the interface  between, for example, a gas and a solid.  ***
