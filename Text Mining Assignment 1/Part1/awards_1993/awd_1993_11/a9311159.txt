Abstract    :
              CTS-9311159  Purdue University  Hilary H. Lackritz    ABSTRACT    The
              spectroellipsometer to be acquired with this equipment award will be used for
              the investigation of local microstructure and optical properties of polymeric
              films in conjunction with other spectroscopic methods.  Different techniques
              for the preparation of the films (Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, spin-coating,
              and dip-coating) will be compared on the basis of film characteristics.    Thin
              polymer films and their optical properties are important to the economic
              competitiveness of the Nation in production of new generations of computers and
              audiovisual equipment.  wa
