Abstract    :
              9311269  Orin  The Department of Electrical Engineering at  The Ohio State
              University will purchase a  High Performance Graphics Platform which will  be
              dedicated to support research in  engineering.  The equipment will be used for 
              several research projects; each project  addresses a critical problem
              associated with  unmanned underwater robotic systems.   Interest in underwater
              robotics is growing  because of its potential  for use in a range  of
              applications, including ecological  studies, salvage operations, geophysical 
              exploration, rescue and recovery operations,  and maintenance and repair of
              man-made  underwater structures.    In particular the supported projects focus
              on  issues related to the simulation, control and  monitoring of underwater
              robotics in  hazardous and unstructured environments.  The  primary projects
              are: 1) real-time dynamic  simulation of an unmanned underwater vehicle  and
              manipulator system and its associated  controller, 2) real-time dynamic
              simulation  of an underwater walking vehicle, 3) dynamic  simulation and neural
              control of enveloping  power grasps, and 4) real-time display of  video data
              compressed using a technique which  employs artificial neural networks.
