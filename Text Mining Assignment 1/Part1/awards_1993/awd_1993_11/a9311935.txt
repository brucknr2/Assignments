Abstract    :
              311935  Walker    A joint research program between the Lamont-Doherty Earth 
              Observatory at Columbia University and the International Business  Machine
              Thomas J. Watson Research Center is proposed.  The project  combines
              Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory's unique capabilities in  high-pressure
              petrology with International Business Machine's  expertise in solid state
              chemistry and physics for the purpose of  investigating the synthesis of new
              copper oxide and sulfide phases.  This proposal represents an
              academic-industrial collaboration.   National Science Foundation support is
              sought for the Lamont-  Doherty Earth Observatory part of the program only. 
              Exploratory  synthesis work will be performed to create a homologous series of 
              ordered copper oxide phases based on the infinite layer-type  structure.  High
              pressures will be used to produce perovskite-  related precursors, and phase
              equilibrium studies conducted to  determine the conditions for ordering of
              various combinations of A-  site cations and oxygen vacancies into specific
              derivative  structural forms.  The goal is to create new materials and at the 
              same time learn how high-temperature superconductivity arises in  these various
              structure types.  Also proposed is a high-pressure  investigation of possible
              copper sulfide analogs of the  superconducting cuprates.  Since tetrahedral
              copper coordination  predominates in the crystal chemistry of the copper
              sulfides,  pressure is expected to be a major factor in the stabilization of 
              ternary copper sulfides into desired perovskite or intergrowth-type  lattices. 
              Preliminary work focuses on transforming copper sulfide  into a rock-salt type
              structure, and proceeds to exploratory  studies on sulfide analogs of the
              high-temperature cuprates.  The  routes to such new materials are unexplored
              and the synthetic  challenge promises unexpected and exciting developments.
