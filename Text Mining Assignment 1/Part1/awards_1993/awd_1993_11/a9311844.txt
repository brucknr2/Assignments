Abstract    :
              The International Union for Circumpolar Health has sought support              
              to establish an international working group on fetal alcohol                   
              syndrome in conjunction with the IX International Congress on                  
              Circumpolar Health scheduled for June 20-25, 1993 in Reykjavik,                
              Iceland. FAS is an entirely preventable problem which has reached              
              epidemic proportions in the Arctic. The FAS problem requires                   
              social, educational and health solutions. International                        
              collaboration allows for the study of the epidemiology of FAS and              
              the planning and development of evaluation and prevention                      
              strategies in the Arctic.
