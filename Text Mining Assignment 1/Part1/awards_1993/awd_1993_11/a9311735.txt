Abstract    :
              9311735  Raymond       The premise underlying this research is that the
              essential  dynamics of convective systems in the tropical atmosphere can be 
              represented by a combination of a nonlinear balance model and 
              parameterizations for cumulus convection, solar and thermal  radiation, and
              surfaces fluxes.  The principal investigator argues  that conceptual framework
              of the balanced model can be used to  study a variety of scales of atmospheric
              motion related to  convection in tropical regimes, and has the potential for
              providing  new insights into the dynamics.  Predictions of a nonlinear balance 
              model will be compared with some of the observations from three  different
              tropical field programs, each of which focused on a  different tropical
              phenomena:  the Hawaiian Rainband Project  (orographically forced rainbands),
              the Tropical Experiment in  Mexico (tropical cyclogenesis), and the Coupled
              Ocean-Atmosphere  Response Experiment (Madden-Julian oscillation, westerly wind
               bursts, and equatorial troughs).       The support for this project will be
              shared by the Large-scale  Dynamic Meteorology, Mesoscale Dynamic Meteorology,
              and Climate  Dynamics Programs.  ***
