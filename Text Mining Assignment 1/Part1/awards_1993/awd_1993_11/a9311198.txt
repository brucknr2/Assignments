Abstract    :
              9311198  Sakaguchi    This project will investigate the biological significance
              of certain specific molecules during the development of the brain .  This
              project will test the hypothesis that the growing tips of nerve cell processes,
              or growth cones, use receptors for extracellular matrix molecules and specific
              cell adhesion molecules to navigate through the brain to their appropriate
              targets.  The role of these molecules will be characterized using
              function-blocking reagents in the developing visual system.  In addition, a
              combination of biochemical , immunological and molecular techniques will be
              used to examine the spatial and temporal distribution of these molecules during
              development.  The results of these studies will provide important new
              information  on the cellular and molecular basis of growth cone guidance and
              pathway selection.  The longer term goal is to better understand the cellular
              and molecular mechanisms that regulate the formation of specific nerve
              connections during development.  ***      9311198  Sakaguchi    This project
