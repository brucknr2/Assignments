Abstract    :
              9311776  Cassandras  This proposal is in response to the Engineering Faculty 
              Internship Initiative.  The objective of the proposed project is  to provide
              the opportunity for the Principal Investigator and two  graduate students to
              closely work with the OTIS Elevator Company,  in order to develop and test
              several dynamic dispatching schemes  for elevator systems.  These are novel
              schemes based on research  carried out by the PI and his students in the
              broader context of  Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS).  In particular, the 
              solution to some dispatching control problems is of a form which  ultimately
              depends on a set of discrete "threshold" parameters.   Some of the proposed
              schemes are based on "learning" the optimal  values of these parameters, based
              on readily observed data from  an elevator system and by applying techniques
              recently developed  for the on-line control of stochastic DEDS.  Thus, this is
              an  opportunity to put some theory developed for DEDS control and  performance
              optimization to the test, as well as to gain a better  understanding of a class
              of DEDS and related problems of design,  analysis, control, and performance
              optimization.  In accordance  with the guidelines of this Initiative, the OTIS
              Elevator Company  has already made a commitment of $30,000 (non-federal funds)
              to  support this effort and has assigned a co-investigator for the  project.
