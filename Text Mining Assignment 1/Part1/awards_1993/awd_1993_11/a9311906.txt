Abstract    :
              9311906  Pitt                                  This one year exploratory project
              is  on research to determine the effect  of strong electric fields on the 
              permeation of water and  cryoprotectants (CPAs) across cell  membranes. 
              Membrane permeabilities,  as affected by electroporation, will  be determined
              for a model cell  system and a single CPA (glycerol)  to explore the basic
              concepts and  elucidate mechanisms.  This project,  which is to provide
              preliminary  data, will involve: (1) the assembly  and testing of equipment;
              (2) a  study of the effect of  electroporation conditions on cell  viability;
              and (3) experiments to  quantify the penetration rate of  glycerol into cells
              at different  electroporation conditions.  The  results of this research may
              provide  important information for the long -  term storage of viable cells at 
              cryogenic temperatures.  This has  applications in biotechnology,  agriculture
              and medicine.  ***
