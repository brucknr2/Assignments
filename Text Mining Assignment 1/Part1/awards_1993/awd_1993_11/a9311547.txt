Abstract    :
              This grant is for partial support for travel to the Eighth                     
              International Conference on Fracture, ICF8, to be held in Kiev,                
              Ukraine, 8-14 June 1993 by a group of seventeen U.S. engineers                 
              and scientists who will participate in the Conference as plenary               
              and keynote speakers.  The Conference will provide a forum for                 
              the presentation of state-of-the-art research findings in the                  
              area of fracture to an audience of leading workers.  It is the                 
              eight in a series of such Conferences that started in 1965.  They              
              are held once every four years at different locations in the                   
              world, and are attended by eminent researchers.  The gathering of              
              these individuals at the Conference will allow for personal                    
              interactions that will provide exchange of information and ideas,              
              and the possible formation of new research groups.  Proceedings                
              of the Conference will be published and will thus be available as              
              an important archival resource for future use by the engineering,              
              science and technology communities.
