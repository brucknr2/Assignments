Abstract    :
                9311730  Wright    This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              Program   will assist the Department of Chemistry at Utah State    University
              in the purchase of a high resolution 400 MHz,   multinuclear, nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer.   This upgrade will enhance greatly research in a
              number of  areas   including the following:    1)  Novel approaches to
              nonlinear optical polymers and new   catalytic reactions,  2)  Rhodium
              catalyzed silaformylation of carbonyl compounds,  3) Reactivity of complexes
              containing the   nitrosylcyclopentadienylruthenium core,  4)  Synthesis of
              cyclic peptides containing diaryl ether alpha-  amino acids via Diehls-Alder
              methods,  5)  New methods for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds,  6)  NMR
              investigations into the function of Aeromonas   aminopeptidase,  7) 
              Characterization of new zinc and cadmium complexes using   NMR,  8)  Reactions
              of organic ion radicals and doubly charged ions.    %%%       A nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to   obtain information about
              molecular structure (what types of   carbon and/or hydrogen atoms and/or
              hetero-atoms are present,   what are the relative number of each type of atoms
              and how are   they connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular  
              dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the molecule   moving).  This
              instrument is essential for any meaningful,   modern synthetic chemistry
              research program.  ***
