Abstract    :
              9311545  Aref    Research is to be conducted on the interaction between multiple
               vortices. These interactions are relevant to the dynamics of  turbulence. The
              approach is primarily numerical and partly  theoretical, based on tools from
              dynamical systems theory,  physical kinetics, and renormalization group theory.
              Numerical  modeling will be from Direct Numerical Simulations.     Results will
              have relevance to various aspects of turbulent  flow, particularly the
              fragmentation and merging or reconnection  of embedded vortex structures.
              Clarification of such mechanisms  will impact the development of more rational
              models for  predicting turbulent flows in various areas of engineering.  ***
