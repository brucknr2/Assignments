Abstract    :
              Support for continued activities of the Committee on Atomic,  Molecular and
              Optical Sciences of the National Academy of  Sciences is provided  The funds
              are used to carry out  surveys and to prepare reports on atomic, molecular and 
              optical activities which are used as information sources by  federal agencies
              and to set priorities for the subfield.  in  carrying out these activities it
              is necessary to provide  funds for travel of the committee members and for the
