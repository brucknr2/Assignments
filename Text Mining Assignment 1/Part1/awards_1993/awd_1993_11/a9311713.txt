Abstract    :
              This award is made to the Universiy of California at Irvine in                 
              support of the career advancement activities of Professor                      
              Fillmore Freeman. Professor Freeman, whose research has been                   
              largely experimental, will spend the Fall Quarter at UCLA                      
              acquiring expertise in molecular modeling and computational                    
              chemistry under the tutelage of Professor Kendall Houk. The PI                 
              will learn the fundamental principles of modeling programs                     
              including ALCHEMY III, AM-1, INSIGHT/DISCOVER, MACCS-3D, MM3,                  
              PCMODEL, SPARTAN and GAUSSIAN92. Upon his return to UCI, he                    
              will apply these computational programs to his current research                
              interests on vicinal-disulfoxides, Diels-Alder reactions of                    
              azadienes, C-nucleosides as antivirals, and 1,3-dipolar                        
              cycloadditions.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              This career advancement award will enable the PI to learn the                  
              scope and limitations of molecular and quantum mechanics and                   
              allow him to apply them to current research areas as well as                   
              broaden his interests into biotechnology, peptide chemistry and                
              computer-aided drug design. His knowledge of computational                     
              chemistry will also be of benefit to his undergraduate and                     
              graduate students.
