Abstract    :
              9311357          The purpose of this project is to address the lack of
              instructional resources as the undergraduate level and to support the ongoing
              research and teaching efforts at the graduate level in the area of queueing
              network theory and applications.  Another major objective is to be better
              prepare students in the area of performance modeling using queueing networks,
              so that they can help industry to make effective use of performance analysis
              tools and packages in managing their operations.          The work will make a
              significant contribution to the preparation of students in the systems analysis
              and design area.  It will do so by bridging the gap between research and
              instruction in the area of performance modeling using queueing networks.  With
              exposure to recent developments in the performance analysis area, students will
              be able to help industry in making effective use of this technology.  Using
              currently available commercial software tools they can then help industry to
              remain competitive in the global environment.  With regard to engineering
              education, this effort will contribute to the attainment of a much needed
              science base for production or manufacturing systems design.  It also has the
              potential for greatly increasing the use of queueing theory in practice.
