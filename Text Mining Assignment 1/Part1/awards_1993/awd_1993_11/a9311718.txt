Abstract    :
                   The project is designed to conduct studies at a manufacturing             
              facility dealing with surface mount technology and the development             
              of the processes required to monitor the placement of surface mount            
              components, before and after the reflow process.                               
                   The intent of the research effort is to develop in line                   
              process monitors and to verify if such monitors are useful in                  
              controlling the placement of fine pitch surface mount components               
              on printed circuit boards after the reflow process is complete.
