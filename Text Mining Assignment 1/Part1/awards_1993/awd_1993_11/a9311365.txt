Abstract    :
              9311365  Lane    This award provides travel costs for an Assistant  Professor at
              the University of Alabama to visit  China and work with the Qingdao Institute
              of  Chemical Technology on modelling jet loop  reactors for carbonyl synthesis.
               This is an  important issue in chemical technology which the  Chinese have
              been working on, and for which they  have developed a reactor.  During the
              three-month  visit by Dr. Lane, a computer simulation will be  constructed of a
              jet loop reactor used to  synthesize butyraldehydes from propene, carbon 
              monoxide and hydrogen over a homogenous cobalt  catalyst.  This cooperative
              work on a challenging  technical problem will also open up opportunities  for
              future scientific cooperation with China.  ***
