Abstract    :
              9311742  Garcia                                Abstract    Previous approaches
              to the study of change in ethnic languages in  situations of language contact
              have attributed change solely to  the combination of linguistic systems in
              contact and/or the  language dominance of individual speakers.  Recent research
               suggests that a constriction in the domains of ethnic language  use must be
              considered in addition to external factors such as  age, sex, social class,
              etc.    This research will explore the idea that change is also due to  the
              restriction in domains (socially defined settings) in which  bilingual speakers
              use the ethnic language in the community.  The  Spanish spoken by
              Mexican-Americans in the United States,  Southwest Spanish, is characterized by
              phenomena typical to  language situations, for example, phonological transfer,
              loan  translations, and lexical borrowings.  This study will be  conducted in a
              Spanish-English community (San Antonio) and in a  home/family domain rather
              than a school domain, as in previous  research.  Sociolinguistic sampling and
              data collection will be  conducted with young adults and adults.  Data will be
              deposited  in the University of Texas-San Antonio, Hispanic Research Center.   
              Results of this research will add to our knowledge of Spanish  sociolinguistics
              and will have potential application in bilingual  education, language
              acquisition, and language policy and  planning.  ***
