Abstract    :
              9311494  Kellert  The field of nonlinear dynamics has enjoyed tremendous growth
              in  recent years.  Researchers in the physical, biological, and social 
              sciences have found the methods and techniques to be useful for  investigating
              linear models when they break down because of effects  such as friction or
              feedback that introduce strong nonlinear terms  into their idealized systems. 
              The study of strongly nonlinear  systems often reveals highly complex and
              unpredictable behavior  even in very simple mathematical models, and this
              phenomenon has  been called "chaos."      The scientific investigation of
              chaotic behavior is popularly known  as "chaos theory."  The popularization of
              chaos theory has also  invited some misunderstandings.  Here the philosophy of
              science can  be of some public and professional help in removing confusion and 
              critically evaluating the claims made.  Further, as a field of  investigation
              which is even now enjoying dramatic growth and  change, nonlinear dynamics
              provides an excellent situation for  philosophy of science to make contact with
              scientific knowledge in  the very process of its construction.  Under this
              grant, Dr.  Kellert is continuing his efforts to improve our understanding of 
              the structure of non-linear dynamics, the new techniques associated  with it,
              and the general impact it will have on our conception of  science.  In
              particular, he is applying an examination of the  modeling techniques used in
              the study of chaotic systems to the  questions of the structure of scientific
              theories and the nature of  the relationship between different sciences.  ***
