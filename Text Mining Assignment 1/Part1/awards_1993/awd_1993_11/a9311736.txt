Abstract    :
                   This Engineering Faculty Internship is a collaborative effort             
              between the University and an industrial partner.  It will result              
              in a computer system that will provide human-machine integration               
              within the production environment.  The system, will use standard              
              statistical process control methods for quality assurance plus                 
              Bayesian Analysis and will integrate the entire manufacturing                  
              facility under a user-friendly, multi-user, custom-made, data-                 
              base.  This project has the potential to greatly enhance the                   
              quality assurance effort of the corporation. //
