Abstract    :
              9311507  Dominguez  The purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of
              central  bank policies on the behavior of foreign exchange rates.  Central 
              banks have at their disposal two instruments that can influence  exchange
              rates; monetary policy and sterilized foreign exchange  rate intervention
              policy.  Monetary policy can directly affect  exchange rates, but central banks
              appear to use monetary policy  primarily with domestic objectives in mind. 
              Sterilized  intervention operations, which change the composition rather than 
              the number of outstanding assets, affect exchange rates in a  somewhat less
              direct fashion than monetary operations do.   Nevertheless, central banks
              apparently rely heavily on sterilized  intervention policy.  The G-5 central
              banks have undertaken an  unprecedented number of both coordinated and
              unilateral  intervention operations in the last seven years.  The empirical 
              evidence presented in the literature on the effectiveness of  intervention is
              quite mixed.  This project will bring together  the this literature to examine
              the effects of U.S. and German  monetary intervention policies on the
              dollar-mark exchange rate.   The research will cover the period since the
              abandonment of the  Bretton Woods system.  This research is important because
              it will  determine the effectiveness of recent central bank intervention  as
              compared to past interventions, and whether intervention has  its greatest
              effect on the level or the variance of exchange  rates.  ***
