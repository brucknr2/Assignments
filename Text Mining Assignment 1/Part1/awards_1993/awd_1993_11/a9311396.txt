Abstract    :
              9311396  CURRY      Besides their importance in the zooplankton and as links in
              the  marine food web, foraminifera and radiolaria also produce hard  parts that
              contribute to the flux, respectively, of calcium  carbonate and opaline silica
              from the upper ocean to the sea floor.   As part of the Arabian Sea Process
              Study, scientists from the Woods  Hole Oceanographic Institution and Brown
              University will quantify  the effects of the monsoon winds upon the production
              of  foraminifera and radiolaria and upon the flux of their hard parts  to the
              seafloor cores from the seafloor.  Such studies should help  us to understand
              both present-day and historical patterns of  oceanic biological production and
              particle flux associated with the  monsoons.
