Abstract    :
                   Ratner's project will 10 extend Raghunathan's conjectures to              
              p-adic Lie groups, 2) study the dynamical properties of the                    
              geodesics and the horocycle flows on homogeneous spaces of                     
              SL(2,Q_p), 3) apply previous results on orbit closures of                      
              unipotent flows to find asymptotic growth rate of integral                     
              solutions of quadratic inequalities, and 4) study Principal                    
              Congruence groups and the Ramanujan-Selberg Conjecture.                        
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics can               
              be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                          
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
