Abstract    :
              9311876   Oyama    This is a study  of the reactions of ozone on
              transition-metal  oxides.  Ozone decomposition on oxide catalysts is observed
              to  determine the effects of oxide-support and oxide-oxide  interactions;
              kinetics measurements are made for the most active  systems. 
              Adsorption/desorption properties of the oxides are  studied using
              temperature-programmed techniques; the mode of ozone  adsorption is studied
              using isotope scrambling.  Dispersion, phase  composition, and surface
              intermediates in single-component and  binary catalytic systems are determined
              using X-ray diffraction and  laser Raman spectroscopy.  In situ techniques such
              as the Hall  effect, quartz-crystal microbalance, and surface charge 
              measurements are employed to show  whether p-type oxides are more  active
              catalysts and whether the superoxide ion (02-) is a possible  reaction
              intermediate.  Finally, the reactivities of ozmne/oxygen  mixtures with ethanol
              or propylene are observed.    It is "common knowledge" that transition-metal
              oxides can catalyze  reactions and decomposition of ozone, but these systems
              have never  been studied systematically.  This study has not only fundamental 
              significance, but also practical importance both in issues about  the
              environmental fate of ozone and in the development of  technology to control
              ozone levels in environmental or occupational  settings.  ***
