Abstract    :
                  MARRA  9311255      This proposal is a continuing  effort of to collect and 
              process data on optics and pigment distribution by combining  the efforts of
              JGOFS and the Word Ocean Circulation  Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program
              (WHP).  The program  will operate a bio-optical profiler to collect data  on
              the  biological and optical properties of the upper water column.  Data to
              collected include spectral irradiance (7 channels  each of upwelling and
              downwelling ), broad-band visible  irradiance (PAR), fluorescence, and beam
              transmission.  This  is perhaps the first undertaking of a systematic and 
              consistent data collection on the oceans pigment and optical  properties, and
              would be invaluable in improving algorithms  for satellite imaging of ocean
              pigments and in estimating  primary production.    ***
