Abstract    :
              Morgan         This project is constructing a computer optimized toward  speech
              recognition algorithms, and is evaluating speech  algorithms on the machine.  A
              fundamental goal of the project is  to explore the architectural changes needed
              for speech processing  in future production systems.  The new computer is a
              low-degree  multiprocessor, each node of which contains a high-speed general- 
              purpose processor, a multiple-accumulate processor, memory, and a 
              communications interface for the multiprocessor interconnect.   The computer
              will also be capable of being extended to include  analog processing or smart
              sensors.  This new machine will  provide the performance of supercomputers at a
              small fraction of  their cost on the speech recognition problem, and will
              contribute  to the development of speech recognition systems for everyday use 
              in commodity computers.
