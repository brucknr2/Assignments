Abstract    :
                  9311701  Willows  The Friday Harbor (FHL) is the marine biological facility
              of the  University of Washington.  It offers biological resources and 
              scientific facilities in support of the work of marine scientists  from
              national and international institutions.  FHL is located in  the San Juan
              Islands in the State of Washington at the junction  between Puget Sound, Juan
              de Fuca Strait and Georgia Strait where  an unusual diversity and richness of
              marine life occurs.  Topics  of research range from cell biology to community
              ecology and  engage zoologists, fisheries biologists, Oceanographers, 
              botanists, paleobiolgists, and researchers from various  biomedical fields. 
              Some organisms are studied because of their  ecological importance, others
              because they are useful models for  the study of ecological, developmental, or
              physiological  processes.  At FHL, a high priority is placed upon providing a 
              suitable environment (instrumentation, field biological  resources, logistical
              support) for research that requires marine  organisms.  Although over 90% of
              the FHL operating budget comes  from State of Washington, over 65% of the
              scientific people whose  work is supported by FHL are from institutions outside
              the State  of Washington.    The University of Washington has recently
              completed an extensive  review of physical facilities, and academic programs of
              the FHL.   Recommendations include extensive replacement and modernization  of
              facilities over 10 years.  The University has committed  significant resources
              to the first component of this  modernization program.  This project will
              provide for replacement  of one microscope, as a part of that renewal.    ***
