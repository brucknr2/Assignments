Abstract    :
                9311877  Allen    This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. 
              The  research focuses on strategies for automatically determining sensor 
              parameter values for planning of sensor tasks.  This will enable  value
              selection and tailoring to match task requirements, thereby  supporting more
              flexible and reliable autonomous operation of  sensor systems.  Building on a
              Machine Vision Planning system (MVP)  already implemented at Columbia
              University, the new research will  extend this framework, and support
              experiments with the system in  static and dynamic environments.  Three main
              thrusts of the  research are: 1) improving the performance of the optimization 
              approach to finding admissible viewpoints; 2) extending static  sensor planning
              results to dynamic environments;and 3) extending  MVP to sensor systems other
              than vision (tactile, range, and  proximity).
