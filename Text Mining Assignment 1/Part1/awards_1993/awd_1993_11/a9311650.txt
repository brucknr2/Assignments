              l993, on the campus of the University of Hildesheim,  Germany.  The proceedings
              of CONCUR '93 will be published as a  volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer
              Science series by  Springer-Verlag.  The conference's purview spans all areas
              of  semantics, logics and verification techniques for concurrent  systems. 
              Particular topics include, but are not limited to,  process algebras, Petri
              nets, true concurrency, shared-memory and  message-passing formalisms,
              operational and denotational models,  programming language semantics,
              concurrent logic and constraint  programming, fairness, temporal logics,
              compositional analysis  techniques, and verification tools.  ***
