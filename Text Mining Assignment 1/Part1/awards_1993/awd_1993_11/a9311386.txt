Abstract    :
              9311386  Katz       This grant supports the research of Professor S. Katz to 
              work in algebraic geometry. He will work on the mirror symmetry  conjecture
              that arose from superstring theory. He will also  continue to develop a
              computer algebra package for doing  intersection computations.       The
              research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of  the oldest parts of
              modern mathematics, but one which blossomed  to the point where it has, in the
              past 10 years, solved problems  that have stood for centuries. Originally, it
              treated figures  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely 
              polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra,  but also
              from analysis and topology, and conversely it is  extensively used in those
              fields.  Moreover it has proved itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics,
              theoretical computer  science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.  ***
