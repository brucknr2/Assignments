Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a workshop on the role of the                     
              Laurentide Ice Sheet in the climate system.  The interaction and               
              relative importance of the ocean, atmosphere, and ice in the                   
              climate system during the last glacial cycle will be the focus of              
              the workshop.  A number of new and significant developments in                 
              research of ice-age climates, ice-sheet dynamics, and the geologic             
              record of climate change indicate that ice sheets played a                     
              dynamically significant role in climate change of potentially                  
              global significance.  The primary objective of the workshop is to              
              coordinate multidisciplinary studies of the climate system in order            
              to initiate data-model integration and model development.
