Abstract    :
              9311416  Gary       The grant supplies major funding for the analysis of radio 
              data from the Owens Valley Solar Array, a solar-dedicated array  capable of
              two-dimensional mapping of solar flares and active  regions at a wide range of
              microwave frequencies.  The array has  recently been upgraded to 5 antennas,
              giving 10 baselines at each  observing frequency.  By combining UV coverage in
              closely spaced  frequencies, we obtain snapshot maps at a number of frequency 
              bands, or for steady emission the project obtains rotational  synthesis maps at
              up to 45 frequencies.  The combination of  spectral and imaging capabilities
              makes the array a unique,  powerful instrument for studying the physical
              conditions in active  regions, and the spatial and temporal development of
              mildly  relativistic electrons accelerated in flares.  During the period 
              covered by this proposal, observations made jointly with currently  operating
              spacecraft (Yohkoh and CGRO) will be of added importance.  Early results prove
              that the instrument fulfills its design goals.  ***
