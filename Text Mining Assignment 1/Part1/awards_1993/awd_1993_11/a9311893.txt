Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9311893  Williams     The application of a transverse magnetic
              field to Czochralski crystal growth of semiconductors has been found to improve
              the distribution of dopants and the crystal quality itself. However, optimal
              results are impossible to obtain without an understanding of the melt flow,
              which has proved elusive. The PI proposes to formulate the initial development
              of a three-dimensional spectral method numerical model to examine the melt
              growth for moderate to high magnetic field strengths. The planning activities
              will consist of an in-depth literature review, and a close examination of the
              governing equations, boundary conditions, and simplifications. Care will be
              taken to fully explore the aims and motivations of the larger numerical study,
              and to initiate and maintain contact with experimentalist in the field. Initial
              numerical studies will be performed to promote familiarity with the
              computational and graphical techniques.
