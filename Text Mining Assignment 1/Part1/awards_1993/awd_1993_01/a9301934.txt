Abstract    :
              The University of Hawaii will continue development of the Hawaii               
              Undersea Geophysical Observatory (HUGO).  HUGO is envisioned as a              
              long-term, deep-ocean system of sensors, monitors and inter-                   
              connecting electro-optic cables located 1,000 meters deep, atop                
              Loihi Volcano, 35 km southeast of the Island of Hawaii.  Design                
              criteria accommodate a suite of acoustic, seismic, and other                   
              sensors that will be connected to the fiber-optic backbone system              
              and data transmitted ashore and recorded in real time.  With a full            
              suite of sensors, HUGO will be able to continuously monitor seismi-            
              city, tilt, chemical emissions, ocean currents, hydrothermal                   
              activity, and other parameters over long time periods.  The project            
              will provide useful engineering information that will benefit                  
              subsequent seafloor observatories and NSF-sponsored research                   
              projects in the future.  Scientific data will also be obtained                 
              about the Loihi Volcano itself.  AT&T is donating a 35-km electro-             
              optic cable and will lay the cable for the University.  The                    
              University of Hawaii is also providing cost-sharing.
