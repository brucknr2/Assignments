Abstract    :
              This is an award under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research                
              program.  The immediate objective of the project is to isolate and             
              characterize genes encoding two enzymes (ATP sulfurylase and APS               
              kinase) that are involved in the first step in the sulfur                      
              assimilation pathway using Arabidopsis thaliana as an experimental             
              system.  The long-term objective is to understand the biology of               
              sulfur in higher plants.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Sulfur is an essential nutrient required by all organisms.  Plants             
              and microorganisms reduce inorganic sulfate to a variety of organic            
              compounds, and they provide animals with a source of organic                   
              sulfur.  Animals including humans require sulfur, yet do not have              
              the ability to convert inorganic sulfur to organic compounds.  The             
              role of sulfur is diverse, including an essential component of                 
              amino acids, some regulatory molecules and lipids.  In addition,               
              plants' ability to metabolize sulfur is potentially significant in             
              ameliorating sulfur toxicity in the environment.                               
                                                                                             
              Despite its obvious significance, very little is known about the               
              sulfur pathway in higher plants, or the mechanisms by which sulfur             
              mediates important cellular functions.  This research may help open            
              up a new field of research in biology.
