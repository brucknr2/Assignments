Abstract    :
              9301940  Owen  This Americas Program award will support a  research
              collaboration between Prof. Guillermo  Owen of Texas Tech University, and Prof.
              Cornelio  Sanchez-Hernandez of the Universidad Nacional  Autonoma de Mexico
              (UNAM) and Prof. Ricardo Lopez  Wilchis of the Universidad Autonoma
              Metropolitana  in Iztapalapa, Mexico.  The purpose of the  research is to
              conduct biodiversity studies in  Michoacan, the western end of the transverse 
              volcanic belt of southern Mexico.     The principal investigator and his
              collaborators  will conduct a survey of mammals, and their  ectoparasitic
              arthropods, focusing on questions of  regional biodiversity and biogeography. 
              Combined  genetic, morphological, karyotypic, and  ectoparasitic data from each
              specimen will provide  a powerful tool for evaluating systematic and 
              biogeographic phenomena from an evolutionary  perspective.  ***
