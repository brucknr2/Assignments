Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project entails the developement of a unified mixed layer                 
              model which includes all of the subinertial processes in the mixed             
              layer.  This is a subinertial mixed layer (SML) model aiming                   
              towards the improvement of current three-dimensional mixed layer               
              models.  The project has two major components: (1) to further the              
              theoretical development of the SML approximation to include                    
              diabatic forcing, mechanical forcing and interaction with deeper               
              interior layer through both entrainment and pressure forcing; and              
              (2) to apply the SML approximation to specific problems.
