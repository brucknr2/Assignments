Abstract    :
                   The investigators will continue their investigation in crack              
              propagation phenomena in solids.  They will construct analytical               
              solutions to canonical initial/boundary value problems relevant                
              to the modeling of dynamically accelerating cracks in                          
              viscoelastic composites.  Various crack-tip failure zone                       
              constitutive models, both linear and nonlinear, will be                        
              investigated.  For nonlinear models, numerical simulations will                
              be performed of the dynamically growing cracks.  The transition                
              from quasi-static to dynamic crack propagation will be                         
              investigated.                                                                  
                   Cracks from a common mode of failure in structural members                
              of most engineering structures.  The analytical study                          
              and numerical simulations of this project will help the engineers              
              to better understand such failure mechanisms.
