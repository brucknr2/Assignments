Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS)                   
              requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support              
              of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the               
              research vessels ISELIN, a 170 foot vessel, and CALANUS, a 64 foot             
              vessel.  Both vessels are owned and operated by RSMAS.  All of the             
              instruments are for shared-use by a wide variety of scientists.                
              The PI will purchase computer upgrades, improvements to the MOCNESS            
              system, a new rosette pylon, a CTD altimeter, and a piston corer.
