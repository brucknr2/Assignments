Abstract    :
              9301610  Thatte  Static and dynamic typing are often seen as opposing choices in
               the design of high-level programming languages.  In recent years,  there has
              been growing interest in overcoming this dichotomy.  Much existing work in this
              area has been focused on static type  analysis of dynamically typed languages
              where flexibility is  emphasized over static type safety.  The goal of this
              project is  emphasized over static type safety.  The goal of this project is 
              to continue research on an approach suitable for extending  statically
              type-safe languages with limited dynamic typing to  support important features
              such as persistent objects.  The  project is investigating the use of
              techniques such as set  constraint resolution, partial evaluation and abstract 
              interpretation to design type systems that support maximal static  detection of
              dynamic type errors with minimal dynamic tagging and  checking.  ***
