Abstract    :
                   McCarthy will study various spaces of holomorphic functions               
              and the natural operators acting on these spaces.  He will                     
              investigate the existence of radial or non-tangential boundary                 
              values for every function in an infinite dimensional Hilbert or                
              Banach holomorphic space, and the connection between this                      
              phenomenon and the geometry of the space.  He will also                        
              investigate how elements of holomorphic spaces can be decomposed               
              into products of special functions, analogous to the inner-outer               
              factoring in the classical Hardy spaces.                                       
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
