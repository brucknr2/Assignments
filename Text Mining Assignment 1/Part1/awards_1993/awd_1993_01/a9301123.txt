Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Study compares rates of decomposition of phytoplanktonic                  
              lipids in oxic and anoxic sediments.  The importance of various                
              factors which control the preservation of organic matter in marine             
              sediments is at present controversial, with both rain rate of                  
              organic carbon to the sea floor and variable rates of competing                
              issues.  This study will specifically determine the rates of lipid             
              decomposition in oxic and anoxic sediments.  Laboratory incubations            
              using 14C-labelled algae and labelled individual lipids will be                
              conducted with the objective of estimating degradation rates for               
              aerobic and anaerobic decomposition processes.  The decomposition              
              rates obtained from the laboratory experiments will then be                    
              compared with rates calculated from modelling of lipid                         
              distributions in coastal sediments.  The results will lead to a                
              better understanding of the importance of oxic vs anoxic                       
              environments in the degradation or preservation of organic matter              
              in sediments.
