Abstract    :
              This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project  will                
              provide The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON)                  
              emergency funding for the reestablishment of research capabilities             
              that were lost or damaged during the passage of Hurricane ANDREW in            
              August 1992.  NSF funds will be used to permit the acquisition of              
              shared-use equipment and rebuild the nutrient analysis laboratory.             
              This facility supports several ongoing NSF-funded research                     
              projects.  Funds will also be used to design a new marine                      
              operations building that will better protect the equipment,                    
              supplies, and electronics activities from storm damage.  The NSF               
              funds are aimed at assisting the basic research programs that                  
              LUMCON conducts.
