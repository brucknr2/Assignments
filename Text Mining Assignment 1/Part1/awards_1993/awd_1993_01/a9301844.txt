Abstract    :
              9301844  White         Laboratory experiments will be undertaken to investigate
              the  formation of ice under controlled thermodynamic conditions  characteristic
              of atmospheric clouds.  Attention will be focussed  on the evaporation of
              supercooled cloud that takes place in eroding  turrets or at cloud edges. 
              Experiments are proposed to evaluate  the ice nucleating capability of the
              evaporated residues of cloud  drops and deduce their role in the production of
              large numbers of  ice crystals at moderate (-5 to -15C) supercoolings.        
              The simulation chamber will be used to subject both  laboratory-produced
              ammonium sulfate aerosol and natural aerosol to  a systematic succession of
              expansion-compression cycles that will  isolate the heterogeneous deposition
              portion of ice nucleation on  the residues of evaporated cloud drops.  ***
