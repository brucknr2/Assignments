Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Phytoplankton pigments have been used extensively to monitor                   
              standing stocks and rates of production and loss within algal                  
              communities.  Chlorophyll-derived pigments that are formed during              
              zooplankton grazing have also been used as tracers for the fate of             
              phytoplankton.  Recent advances in chromatography technology have              
              revealed that phytoplankton pigments actually comprise a suite of              
              related pigments and that some of these compounds appear to be                 
              uniquely associated with grazing by protozoa.  This project with               
              its simple, well-controlled experiments will evaluate pigment                  
              transformation and degradation by marine protozoa.  It's been                  
              hypothesized that kinds and amount of pigments produced are related            
              to grazer species and phytoplankton species, and that post-                    
              elimination processes such as detrital ingestion and photo-                    
              oxidation are important modifiers of pigments.  A critical issue in            
              the use of pigments as biomarkers is the degree to which pigment               
              transformations mirror transformation of organic carbon.  The                  
              ultimate goal of the project will be to develop a tracer which can             
              be used to address several important ecological questions of upper             
              food web dynamics.
