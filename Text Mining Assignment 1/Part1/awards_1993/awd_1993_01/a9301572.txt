Abstract    :
              9301572  Boyer    A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted in a
              rotating tank to study the interaction  between tidal currents and the
              bathymetry in the vicinity of continental shelf breaks.  The full  range of
              parameters influencing the rectification of the coastal currents will be
              explored by  changing the shelf break geometry, the rotation rate and the
              amplitude and angle of the time-  dependent currents impinging on the shelf
              break. Both laminar and turbulent flow regimes will  be investigated.    ***
