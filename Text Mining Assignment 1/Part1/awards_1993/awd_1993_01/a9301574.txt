Abstract    :
              9301574 Ramu The application of the variable structure and sliding mode control
              techniques to reduce the vibratory effects in civil structures due to wind and
              earthquake forces, will be investigated.  Algorithms for synthesizing the
              control forces for both linear and nonlinear models of the structures will be
              developed.  For physical application of control forces, an electric actuator
              with regenerative capability is proposed.  Energy regeneration concept 
              utilized for braking trains and other moving systems will be used both for
              controlling the vibratory effects and for recovering the energy from the
              structures for subsequent cycles in the active control of structures.  The
              proposed regeneration capability is expected to reduce the energy storage
              requirement and will lead to an efficient utilization of the power for the
              application of control forces.  The time delays inherent in the control system
              and the issues concerning real time implementation of the controller using
              single chip micro controller will be analyzed.  This is a collaborative
              research effort involving an electrical engineering team and a structural
              engineering team.  The outcome is expected to be an integration of research
              ideas in the field of control and structural engineering to develop a practical
              approach to mitigate the hazardous vibratory effects in civil structures.
