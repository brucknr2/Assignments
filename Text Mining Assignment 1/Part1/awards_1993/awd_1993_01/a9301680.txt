Abstract    :
              The Deep Submergence Laboratory at the Woods Hole Oceanographic                
              Institution will develop a prototype sampling device for an                    
              opportunistic test in early CY 1993.                                           
                                                                                             
              In February and March 1993, the Jason Project will sponsor a major             
              expedition to the Guaymas Basin in the Pacific.  An advanced ROV               
              system will be used to take high quality video images from the                 
              seafloor and relay them to the surface support ship, thence via                
              satellite to select sites across the U.S. where scientists and                 
              students will be able to operate certain functions of the ROV while            
              it's on the bottom.  Two NSF-funded investigators will participate.            
              The high quality video capabilities will augment the collection of             
              data for their NSF research, but the collection of discrete                    
              biological samples in addition to the video will greatly enhance               
              it.  A conceptual design for a new deep-sea suction sampler for use            
              on the Jason ROV has been completed and preliminary tests have been            
              made.  This SGER funding will allow the construction and testing of            
              a full prototype sampler in time for use during the Jason Project              
              expedition.  If scientifically successful during the Jason                     
              expedition, the sampler will be useful on upcoming NSF-sponsored               
              cruises.
