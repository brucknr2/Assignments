Abstract    :
              9301318  Meachan      This proposal is for a modeling study of the Black Sea.
              The main  goal is to study the general circulation and synoptic scale eddy 
              field of the basin.  The selected area is relative small enclosed  basin which
              facilitates good resolution at eddy- resolving length  scales and minimizes the
              use of open boundary conditions. At the  same time, the Black sea is considered
              large enough to exhibit many  of the circulation features found in larger
              basins. There is a  reasonable data base against which the model performance
              may be  checked and, several of the oceanographic research centers located  on
              the shores of the Black sea have already indicated their  interest in
              collaborate in the project.  This presents a good  opportunity for scientific
              international cooperation.
