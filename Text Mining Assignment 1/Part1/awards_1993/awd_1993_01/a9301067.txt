Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will pursue research in                        
              commutative algebra on graded rings and local rings and their                  
              singularities. Topics include Hilbert functions, Hilbert                       
              polynomials, birational extensions and formal fibers.  The work                
              has specific applications to algebraic geometry, particularly to               
              the problem of resolution of singularities.                                    
                   This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of              
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
