Abstract    :
              Dr. Phillip W. Kash has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                   
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Kash's doctoral degree was from                   
              the University of Chicago under the supervision of Professor                   
              Laurie Butler. Dr. Kash will continue research at Columbia                     
              University under the sponsorship of Professors Brian Bent and                  
              George Flynn. Dr. Kash's postdoctoral training will provide him                
              with surface science skills as he studies the dissociation and                 
              reaction dynamics of alkyl halides adsorbed on copper surfaces                 
              using scanning tunneling microscopy. Longer term, Dr. Kash                     
              plans to investigate how intramolecular nonadiabatic electron                  
              excitation transfer influences the branching between competing                 
              bond fission channels in the photodissociation of molecules                    
              adsorbed on surfaces.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
