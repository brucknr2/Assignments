Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will                                
              support the collaboration of John Eyler of the                                 
              University of Florida and Jose Riveros of the                                  
              University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.  The project                                
              will focus on determining the infrared spectra                                 
              and binding energies of negative ions with one                                 
              or two solvent molecules attached to them.                                     
                                                                                             
              Both laboratories involved are equipped with                                   
              mass spectrometric (Fourier transform ion                                      
              cyclotron resonance) and laser instrumentation.                                
               The U.S. group, which includes two students,                                  
              has an electrospray ionization source that will                                
              provide an alternative method of forming singly                                
              solvated anions, and probably the only means of                                
              forming doubly solvated anions.  The US group                                  
              is also equipped for two-laser infrared                                        
              multiple photon dissociation experiments, which                                
              permit infrared spectra of ions to be obtained                                 
              in previously inaccessible wavelength regions.                                 
              The Brazilian side will contribute expertise in                                
              forming the anion solvates by ion/molecule                                     
              reactions.  The collaboration will likely                                      
              increase understanding of the effects that the                                 
              first and second solvent molecule have on                                      
              isolated ions, and thus of the transition from                                 
              "naked" ions in the gas phase to fully solvated                                
              ions in solution.
