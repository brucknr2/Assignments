Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A 3D model capable of efficiently simulating nonlinear gravity            
              wave dynamics has been developed and has shown that the dynamics of            
              wave breaking in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere, or               
              mesopause region, is inherently three-dimensional in nature.  The              
              PIs propose to modify this model to more accurately simulate                   
              conditions in the mesopause region, and then couple the dynamical              
              model to a chemical airglow model for the purpose of studying the              
              effects of nonlinear gravity wave motions on mesopause region                  
              airglow.  The coupled gravity wave and airglow model will have the             
              ability to treat the case of time-dependent chemistry and will be              
              able to simulate the effects of gravity waves on several different             
              mesopause region emissions.  The model can then be used to                     
              strengthen the role of airglow observations in understanding the               
              dynamics of the mesopause region.  A comparison will be made                   
              between the model results and the results of observations and                  
              linear theories.
