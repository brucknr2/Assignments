Abstract    :
              Benjamin J. Schwartz has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Schwartz's doctoral degree was                    
              from the University of California/Berkeley under the                           
              supervision of Professor Charles Harris. Dr. Schwartz intends                  
              to continue research at the University of Texas/Austin under                   
              the sponsorship of Professor Peter Rossky. Dr. Schwartz's                      
              postdoctoral training will provide him with experience in                      
              theoretical techniques such as high quality molecular dynamics                 
              simulations which will allow him to simulate the observables in                
              femtosecond laser experiments. Longer term he plans to employ                  
              new theoretical algorithms and emerging femtosecond                            
              technologies to probe details of the microscopic physics                       
              underlying condensed phase reactivity of polyatomic molecules.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
