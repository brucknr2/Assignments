Abstract    :
              9301584  Spencer  The objective of this project is the development of highly 
              reliable and safe control strategies for structural protection  using
              stability-based hybrid controls.  More specifically, the  research project will
              (1) develop a probabilistic framework for  stability-based, uncertainty
              tolerant control design for  maximizing the reliability of structures operating
              in their  linear range; (2) develop stability-based, nonlinear, hybrid  control
              strategies for application to systems including, but not  limited to, active
              base isolation systems and variable parameter  control device; (3) integrate
              the developments of (1)  and (2)  into a combined design strategy for both
              structure and controller  so as to achieve the maximum overall reliability
              inherent in the  controlled structure; and (4) conduct proof of concept tests
              of  control strategies so that the most promising control  architectures can be
              thoroughly evaluated and verified before  being tested at national laboratories
              such as NCEER.    By means of the reliability approach delineated in this
              proposal,  efforts can be directed toward facets of the hybrid control  problem
              which will yield the most reliable and cost effective  solutions.  The
              successful completion of this research is  expected to enhance the possibility
              of economic and practical  implementation of hybrid control of linear and
              nonlinear  structures for earthquake hazard mitigation.    ***
