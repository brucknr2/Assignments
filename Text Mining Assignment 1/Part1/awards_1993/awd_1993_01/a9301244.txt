Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in the general area of                       
              noncommutative ring theory.  The principal investigator will                   
              investigate the structure of skew polynomial rings, quantum                    
              coordinate algebras, noetherian rings, and related rings.                      
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring              
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplication            
              defined on it.  Although the additive operation satisfies the                  
              commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to do            
              so.  An example of a ring for which multiplication is not                      
              commutative is the collection of nxn matrices over the integers.               
              The study of noncommutative rings has become an important part of              
              algebra because of its increasing significance to other branches of            
              mathematics and physics.
