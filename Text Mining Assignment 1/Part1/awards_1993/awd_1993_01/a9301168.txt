Abstract    :
              9301168  Mohler  This research is on "intelligent control systems" with electric
               power applications.  Model-based nonlinear adaptive and optimal  control
              methodologies are to be used.  Linear, bilinear, and  higher-order nonlinear
              approximations may be used.  The potential  role of artificial neural networks
              as a means to adapt to state  space changes resulting from switching events or
              faults will be  studied.  Fast adaptation to structural changes of the system
              being  controlled is a key objective of the research.  The investigator 
              proposes a hierarchial configuration in which an upper level  consists of a
              statistical detector and an artificial neural network  classifier.  The
              combination would act to select the optimal  control configuration to respond
              to changing power system  conditions.  ***
