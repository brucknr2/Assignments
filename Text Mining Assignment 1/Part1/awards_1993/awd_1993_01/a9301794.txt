Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent observations pointed out that there is a strong biennial                
              component in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which is                  
              closely related to the mean seasonal cycle.  The major objective of            
              this program is to design and test a hierarchy of simple coupled               
              air-sea models to address the presumption that the biennial                    
              oscillation needs to be accounted for, in order to better predict              
              the ENSO phenomena.  The plan is to develop a hierarchy of models              
              that will end with an intermediate ENSO coupled atmosphere-ocean               
              model which will have interannual variability related to seasonal              
              variability as observed.  The models will be validated against                 
              available observations.  Two processes will be examined to                     
              determine the validity of the models:  the effect of evaporation on            
              SST and the influence of monsoonal cycle of convection and winds on            
              interannual variability.
