Abstract    :
                    A Conference session on Domains in Ferroelectrics will be                
              held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on                   
              Ferroelectrics during the Summer, 1993 at NIST to address current              
              research topics such as systems of domain walls and their                      
              interactions with each other, the thermodynamics and kinetics of               
              domain wall configurations and domain walls that are both fer-                 
              roelectric as well as ferroelastic.  There are many materials, such            
              as relaxors, and devices, such as integrated ferroelectric thin                
              film memories, in which these aspects are of central importance.               
              Since these topics are usually not taught as such in graduate                  
              programs the conference organization is making a special effort to             
              have a large student participation.  Arrangements were made to                 
              expand the Conference session into an evening Workshop session to              
              allow for in-depth discussions on critical subject areas.  It is               
              expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the            
              Conference and Workshop sessions will provide an effective forum to            
              discuss and delineate critical scientific issues, and to consider              
              and define the approaches and techniques needed to address them.

                   An evaluation of the status of domains in ferroelectrics, and             
              recommendations by the session participants for the emphasis of                
              future work, and their assessment of the most important contem-                
              porary research issues will be of great value to the understanding             
              and development of ferroelectric and related materials, and for                
              their subsequent utilization in fields such as microelectronics.
