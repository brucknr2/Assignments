Abstract    :
                   This research involves applications of interacting particle               
              systems to biology.  In particular, the investigator will                      
              construct models to explain biological phenomena such as the                   
              temporal oscillations of measles and the patchiness of plankton                
              in the sea.  Another area of interest is the connection with                   
              nonlinear partial differential equations.  By mixing the                       
              particles at a fast rate and scaling space, the system converges               
              to a nonlinear partial differential equation.  This makes it                   
              possible to derive partial differential equations that more                    
              accurately model the biological systems and also to prove results              
              about the particle systems with fast mixing.                                   
                   Interacting particle systems have a structure that makes                  
              them appropriate for use in a variety of contexts in physics,                  
              chemistry, and biology.  There is a grid of sites, each of which               
              can have a fixed set of values.  For example, a city of                        
              individuals can be susceptible to, infected with, or immune to                 
              measles.  Each site changes its value at a rate that depends on                
              the values of its neighbors, and this research is interested in                
              determining what happens to the system over time.  These models                
              should eventually provide a better understanding of global                     
              ecological problems.
