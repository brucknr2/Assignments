Abstract    :
              9301494   Michalowski   The objectives of this research are: 1. to improve
              understanding of soil-reinforcement interaction, and 2. develop an analysis and
              design method for reinforced earth structures, applicable to traditional
              reinforcement (long metal bars, large blankets of synthetic fabric or geogrid),
              short fiber reinforcement, continuous filament reinforcement, and reinforcement
              resisting bending and shear (such as soil nails). The admissible failure modes
              of the reinforced soil mass will be considered within an energy-based approach,
              and the presence of reinforcement will be included as additional terms in the
              energy balance equation due to the energy dissipation within the reinforcing
              elements. Tensile failure of reinforcement, collapse associated with bending or
              shear, and reinforcement slip, and yield criteria for randomly reinforced soil
              will be derived.   ***       ~     ~ME143D TMP            }        ~ME143D TXT
