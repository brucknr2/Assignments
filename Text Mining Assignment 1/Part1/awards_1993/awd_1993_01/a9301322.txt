Abstract    :
              9301322  PREZELIN    This Accomplishment Based Project builds on prior studies
              which  sought to 1) identify the sources and magnitude of variability in 
              phytoplankton spectral properties which determine photosynthetic  quantum
              yield, and 2) provide insights into how phytoplankton  utilize radiant energy,
              influence the spectral characteristics of  water-column optical properties and
              regulate rates of  photosynthesis and photoinhibition. The major objectives of
              this  accomplishment based renewal project are to: 1) further define the 
              spectral linkages between quantum yield for photosynthetic charge  separation,
              oxygen evolution and carbon fixation in different  phytoplankters exposed to
              altered nutrient status, dynamic light  fields and enhanced ultraviolet
              radiation; 2) to identify the  mechanisms by which different spectral groups of
              phytoplankton  respond photosynthetically to environmental change; and 3) to 
              incorporate the findings into bio-optical models being developed in  three
              independently funded field programs. The three field programs  are: a) a study
              of algal pond mesocosm experiments in the  Netherlands, b) along the coastal
              waters of the Palmer Peninsula,  Antarctica on the time scale of years (the
              Antarctic LTER program),   and c) during the austral spring in diverse
              phytoplankton biomes  under the influence of the Antarctic ozone hole
              (Icecolors 93).  ***
