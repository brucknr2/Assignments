Abstract    :
              9301375  Chun       The purpose of this investigation is to determine the  
              process-structure relationships and the extent of structural    control that
              can be achieved in spray forming with uniform    droplets.  Unlike 
              gas-atomized spray forming in which structural  control is limited by the use
              of non-uniform droplet sprays and the  coupling among the spray process
              parameters, this research is based  on the ability to produce uniform metal
              droplet sprays with    precisely controlled droplet size, thermal state and
              mass flux.   A combination of controlled experiments and analysis may lead o an
               understanding of how processing variables affect material    structure, and
              may provide knowledge that can be applied to design  and control the spray
              forming process.  The experiment include    spray forming with controlled
              droplet solidification, undercooling,  mass and enthalpy flux, and with reduced
              ambient pressure.             These experiments are designed to permit studies
              of the      limiting conditions for producing bulk materials with rapidly    
              solidified, novel microstructure directly from the melt.  The     targeted
              novel structures are those with fine, uniform, equiaxed  grains, controlled
              texturing and amorphous phases.  The uniform   droplet spray forming process,
              including the droplets generation,  fluid-thermal state at impact and mass flux
              as well as the        substrate condition, will be characterized and modeled. 
              These    results will be compared with the experimental observations on the 
              microstructure evolution to establish process-structure        relationships in
              the spray forming process.
