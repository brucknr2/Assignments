Abstract    :
              9301833  Siver  This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science award will support the 
              collaboration of Peter Siver of Connecticut College and Maria  Vigna of the
              University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The project  aims to examine the
              biodiversity and ecological requirements of  the algal flora Chrysophyta in the
              Parana River system.    The Chrysophyta, especially the scale-bearing species,
              represent  one of the most important bioindicator groups of aquatic  organisms.
               Their biodiversity in subtropical waters is poorly  understood.  This project,
              an initial phase of a large-scale  study, will describe the composition and
              distribution of species  along environmental gradients for the river's deltaic
              region.   The flora will be compared to other subtropical, tropical, 
              temperate, and arctic regions in order to understand the spatial  distribution
              of this algal group.  Organisms not known to science  will be identified and
              described.  Both the U.S. and the  Argentine sides will benefit from
              development of a database for  use in paleolimnological inference work aimed at
              understanding  the effects of human disturbances on aquatic resources.  ***
