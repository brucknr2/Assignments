Abstract    :
              9301019  Gould   Curriculum materials and software will be developed to make it
              easier and more meaningful for faculty to incorporate computer applications
              into the upper level undergraduate physics curriculum.  These materials would
              give students more opportunities to develop their conceptual understanding of
              the principles of physics, learn about new developments in research, study
              areas of physics not usually taught at the undergraduate level, and apply the
              principles of physics to the other sciences and engineering.  The proposed
              materials would emphasize the unity of physics, its intellectual excitement,
              and its wide applicability.  The principal investigators have extensive
              experience in incorporating computers into the physics curriculum, and the
              proposed work will have national and international impact.  ***   v       s  t
