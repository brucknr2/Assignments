Abstract    :
              Lohmann     9301722    Funds are provided to support the continuation of the
              work on the  chemistry and bathymetry of calcification in planktonic 
              foraminifera. The new emphasis will be on the chemistry and growth  of
              secondary calcite.  This will improve the paleoceanographic  utility of the
              foraminiferal shell chemistry and will allow a test  of the isotopic
              fractionation during calcification. The new work  will build on the techniques
              developed by the PIs for  differentiating chemistries of primary and secondary
              shell  calcites. Morphology of the secondary calcite will be examined to 
              better understand their part in shell formation during the sinking  of the
              shell to the sea floor.
