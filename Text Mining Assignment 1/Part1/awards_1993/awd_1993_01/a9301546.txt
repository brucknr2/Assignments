Abstract    :
                   Central Washington University is establishing a connection to             
              NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line.  The connection enables              
              the faculties and students to communicate and collaborate with the             
              international scientific and educational community, and to access              
              network resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers.             
              This award funds part of the costs for two years.
