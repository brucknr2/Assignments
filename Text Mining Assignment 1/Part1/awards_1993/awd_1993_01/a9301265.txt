Abstract    :
                    9301265  Kokini  The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental
               understanding of crack initiation and crack propagation in  multilayer ceramic
              coatings subjected to thermal loads.  This will  be accomplished by controlled
              experiments where a beam specimen  will be subjected to a laser beam and
              analyzing the stresses and  fracture behavior of the specimen.  The effect of
              material  properties, layer architecture, microstructure and manufacturing 
              temperature will be studied in order to design ceramic coatings  most resistant
              to failure.  ***
