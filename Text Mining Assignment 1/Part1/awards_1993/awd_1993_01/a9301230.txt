Abstract    :
                   Jackson Community College request support from NSF for                    
              connection of their campuses to NSFNET.  MERIT is the midlevel                 
              network located in the state of Michigan that will provide                     
              operations and network information services.  It will give the                 
              colleges a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a             
              high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone                
              network.                                                                       
                   The colleges needs greater functionality and network speed to             
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
