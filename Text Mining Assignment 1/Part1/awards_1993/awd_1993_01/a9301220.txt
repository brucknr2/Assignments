Abstract    :
              9301220  Hoyt    The technique of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is used to
               investigate the kinetics of subcritical nuclei formation in the  aluminum-zinc
              binary alloy system.  In-situ SAXS experiments are  conducted at the 10 meter
              facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory  (ORNL).  The unique feature of the
              ORNL area detector and the  inherent anisotropic scattering in aluminum-zinc is
              used to define  temperatures at which only nuclei of near critical size are 
              forming.  The change in intensity with time is compared to the  recently
              formulated Shi-Seinfeld analytic solution to the problem  of transient
              nucleation rates.  In addition a study of the order-  disorder reaction in
              AgAuCd2 is planned.  The experiment represents  a novel application of the
              technique of neutron resonant scattering  and will measure for the first time
              partial ordering in a ternary  alloy.  This study is performed using the Glass,
              Liquid and  Amorphous Diffractometer (GLAD) at the Intense Pulsed Neutron 
              Source.  %%%  This project examines the formation of structure in metallic 
              materials and leads to an improved understanding of materials  processing to
              develop the appropriate properties in materials.  ***
