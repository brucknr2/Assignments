Abstract    :
                   The research entails investigations of 2-dimensional                      
              discrete dynamical systems using methods of topology and complex               
              function theory.  The dynamics of smooth fractal curves, Julia                 
              sets and dynamics will also be investigated. Such research has                 
              potential applications to a variety of physical models where two               
              dimensional dynamics and fractals are relevant.
