Abstract    :
              9301227  Chen       The interactions of atmospheric flows with mountains is an 
              important issue in atmospheric sciences.  Orography plays a role in  both local
              weather as well as influencing the larger scale flow.   The isolation of the
              mountainous Island of Hawaii provides a  natural laboratory for these studies. 
                   In 1990 a cooperative project among several researchers, the  Hawaiian
              Rainband Project (HaRP), was executed to study the  influence of the island on
              local weather and fundamental  mountain/atmospheric flow interactions.      
              The Principal Investigator will continue and extend his  previous research on
              the relationship between rainbands and the  mesoscale environment using data
              collected during the HaRP.  Using  results from prior observational studies and
              extensive numerical  simulations, he will examine the diurnal evolution of the 
              rainbands, which are a consistent atmospheric feature on the  windward side of
              the island of Hawaii.  The Principal Investigator  will focus on the larger
              scale forcing that controls the location  and strength of the convergence zone
              responsible for the rainbands.   Specifically, the researcher will attempt to
              verify previous  numerical model results pertaining to dynamic forcing of
              rainbands  and will reexamine the role of thermal forcing.  ***
