Abstract    :
                   This award supports the study of equations (both differential             
              and difference) on affine Hecke algebras introduced by the                     
              principal investigator which leads to a new approach to the theory             
              of special functions and combinatorics via the representation                  
              theory of Hecke algebras.  These equations are a generalization of             
              the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation from conformal field theory and            
              its difference counterpart.                                                    
                   Conformal field theory is an important physical theory                    
              describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed                
              matter physics and classical motions of strings in string theory.              
              Besides its importance in physics, the beautiful and rich                      
              mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has                      
              interested many mathematicians.  New relations between different               
              branches of mathematics, such as representations of                            
              infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces and             
              algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular functions and            
              modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is revealed in the            
              study of conformal field theory.  It is believed that the study of             
              the mathematics involved in conformal field theory will lead to new            
              mathematical structures which will be important both in mathematics            
              and theoretical physics.
