Abstract    :
              9301886   Fishkin       Brookings Institution has installed a TCP/IP network
              that  links the equipment in the major academic and administrative  buildings
              together.  It requests support from NSF for connection  of this campus network
              to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel  network located in the southeastern
              United States.  It will  provide operations management and information services
              and it  will give Brookings Institution a 56 thousand bits per second 
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second)
              National Backbone network.       The Institution needs greater functionality
              and network  speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make 
              file transfers along with being able to collaborate with peers at  other
              schools on common projects.  Students and faculty research  will benefit from
              the link.  This is also a unique opportunity  for the school to explore
              innovative educational resources.  ***
