Abstract    :
              9301828  SWIFT    Recent field studies have shown that atmospheric aerosol
              samples  can stimulate the growth of natural phytoplankton populations, just 
              as iron can, in locations that are depleted in iron but contain  major
              nutrients at measurable levels. Computations indicated that  atmospheric
              sources supply a significant amount of iron to the  euphotic zone. Aerosol
              studies have shown that the composition of  marine aerosols (remote from
              continents) includes many trace metals  besides iron with biological
              significance, even though aerosols are  not uniform in their composition. This
              career advancement for women  project will undertake a pilot study examining
              laboratory growth of  phytoplankton exposed to aerosol as an iron or trace
              metal source.  Unique features of this project include: 1. the design of the 
              growth medium and treatment of the sea water so that it can be  chemically
              modeled for metal speciation, and 2. the use of algal  growth (known cultures
              of phytoplankton) as a measure or assay of  a particular metal content. The
              immediate goal is to quantify an  aerosol as a source of biologically
              significant trace metals,  particularly iron, for growth of phytoplankton.  ***
