                  DEB 9321021 Tim          This support will allow preparation, incorporation
              and computerization of an important orphaned collection of Caribbean mammals by
              the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, which holds one of the
              premiere research collections of living mammals in the U.S..  The project also
              entails improving and making accessible to researchers and students the
              sizeable spirit collection of mammals, which hitherto has been housed under
              crowded and poor curatorial conditions.  This award is opportunistic, in that
              it occurs in concert with a planned expansion of the museum into a new wing to
              house all spirit collections.  The systematic collections improved through this
              award are critical research and educational resources for studies in
              biodiversity. %%% The collection of Recent mammals at the University of Kansas
              Museum of Natural History is one of the finest resources for research and
              education, being the fourth largest in North America and the second largest
              collection in a university museum.  It's activity has produced crowed
              conditions which this collection improvement award will help alleviate through
              the provision of additional storage cases and curatorial material. 
              Additionally, the collection is absorbing an orphaned collection of Caribbean
              mammals, which is extremely important to research and education on U.S. and
              Central American mammalian biodiversity.
