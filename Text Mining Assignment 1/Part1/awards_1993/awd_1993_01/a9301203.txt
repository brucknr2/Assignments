Abstract    :
              9301203  Glander III  This project will support research at an undergraduate
              institution  that will involve the collection and analysis of low energy 
              electron diffraction (LEED) data.  The surfaces to be studied are  copper (001)
              and Si(111).  The LEED data will be analyzed using a  holographic technique
              that shows great promise, but which has thus  far only been applied to
              simulated LEED patterns.  If successful,  the technique could lead to
              substantial reductions in the time  required for LEED analysis.  The principal
              investigator will  collaborate with the theorist responsible for developing the
               holographic analysis method.   %%%  This project will support research at an
