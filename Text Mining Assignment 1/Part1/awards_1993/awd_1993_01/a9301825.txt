Abstract    :
              9301825  Mende         The Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory has supported
              the  radar at Sondrestromfjord with a monochromatic all sky imager and 
              meridian scanning photometer for many years.  Joint studies between  the imager
              and the radar are powerful in explaining the  relationship between the
              electrodynamics of the upper atmosphere  and the auroral precipitation patterns
              and their associated  magnetospheric regions.  In this proposal, funds are
              being  requested to refurbish and modify the Sondrestrom all sky  monochromatic
              imager software to incorporate digital data  compression techniques.  The
              instrument will be interfaced to the  Sondrestromfjord local area network.  ***
