Abstract    :
              9301666  Sanchez    This Americas Program award will support a workshop on 
              magnetism, magnetic alloys, and their applications.  The workshop,  organized
              by Prof. Juan M. Sanchez of the University of Texas at  Austin, and Prof. Jose
              L. Moran-Lopez of the Universidad  Autonoma de San Luis de Potosi, Mexico, has
              as primary  objectives to provide an up-to-date and in-depth review of the 
              subject; foster the direct interaction between U.S., European, and  Latin
              American scientists; and explore areas of common interest in  magnetic
              materials between the common interest in magnetic  materials between the Latin
              American and U.S. communities.  The  workshop will involve the participation of
              approximately 30 leading  authorities in magnetic materials and magnetism from
              the U.S.,  Europe and Latin America.    The workshop addresses an area of
              significant current interest in  terms of fundamental aspects and technological
              issues.  The advent  of new materials, advanced processing and synthesis
              techniques,  and new characterization methodologies have set a brisk pace of 
              development in this area.  All participants are likely to benefit from  the
              interaction with researchers having a broad range in the subject  of magnetism
              and magnetic materials.  ***
