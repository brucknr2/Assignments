Abstract    :
                   The Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics of the               
              University of Stony Brook will purchase a 56-node Intel Paragon                
              parallel computer with 32 Mbyte memory per node to support the                 
              following research:                                                            
                   1.  Hyperbolic Waves and Applications to Industrial                       
                       Processes.                                                            
                   2.  Bio-Mathematics and Statistics.                                       
                   3.  Robotic Motion for Efficient Manufacturing.                           
                   This equipment will also provide advanced training to                     
              students learning efficient techniques for parallel computing.
