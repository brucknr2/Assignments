Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Determining the Stable Isotope Signatures of N2O In The Coastal                
              Environments                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This Study will investigate the marine nitrous oxide (N2O) regime              
              by taking advantage of the logistic opportunities provided by a                
              funded experiment that will investigate nitrogen cycling in the                
              suboxic waters of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.                          
              Specifically, the dual stable isotopic composition of N2O will be              
              added to the suite of measurements that will be undertaken by Drs.             
              A. Devol and P. Quay under a project entitled "Benthic carbon                  
              oxidation, denitrification and nitrogen isotope fractionation in               
              continental margin sediments (OCE 9116275).  The additional work               
              will take advantage of a recently developed technique that permits             
              the dual isotope composition of N2O to be determined from small                
              samples. Measurements of the concentration of N2O in the suboxic               
              water column of the eastern tropic Pacific Ocean will also be done.
