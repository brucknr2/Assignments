Abstract    :
              9301788  Berman  We propose to design and develop a tool for visualizing, 
              displaying and optimizing the data and function partitioning of  large programs
              coded in parallel languages with explicit  decomposition constructs.  This tool
              will assist in ensuring that  the decomposition of processes and data will
              promote the most  efficient use of parallelism for a given program and target 
              multicomputer.  Coordinated with this tool will be a parallel  debugger
              (Panorama), which is built on the resident debugger of a  commercial
              multicomputer,  and which will provide a number of  program views that will
              illuminate data movement and message  traffic from the program execution.
