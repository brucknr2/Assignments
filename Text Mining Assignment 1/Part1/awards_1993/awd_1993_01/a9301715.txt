Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This study continues research on the decomposition of organic             
              matter, which comprises a major fraction of carbon in the ocean.               
              The study is directed toward further defining pathways and rates of            
              organic matter decomposition in the oceanic water column, from                 
              production in surface waters, through the zones of remineralization            
              in the water column, to preservation in the underlying sediments.              
              The decomposition of organic matter is one of the major processes              
              controlling the chemical composition of seawater and sediments. On             
              a global scale, oxic decomposition is the major pathway of                     
              degradation in marine sediments, with anaerobic processes consuming            
              much less organic matter.  However, the majority of carbon                     
              preservation occurs in anoxic systems, typically coastal marine                
              sediments where organic matter sedimentation rates are highest.                
              Understanding the controls on organic matter decomposition and                 
              carbon preservation is a key to interpreting changes in sedimentary            
              carbon content, and thus paleoproductivity of the oceans.                      
                                                                                             
                   The major goals of this research are to investigate the                   
              formation of methane from, methylamines in particulate matter, to              
              measure the effects of adsorption and desorption of organic                    
              compounds on their decomposition rates and mechanisms, to determine            
              the influence of oxic vs anoxic conditions on decomposition, and to            
              explore the use of cell-surface enzymes in the decomposition of                
              amino acids and amines by phytoplankton and bacteria.
