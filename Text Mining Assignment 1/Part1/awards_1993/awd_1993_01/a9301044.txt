Abstract    :
              9301044  Jackiewicz    This two-year award supports US-Italy cooperative
              research in  waveform relaxation methods between Zdzislaw Jackiewicz, Arizona 
              State University, and Alfredo Bellen, University of Trieste,  Italy.  The
              objective of their research is to investigate  convergence, order, stability,
              and contractivity properties of  time-point relaxation and waveform relaxation
              Runge-Kutta methods  for ordinary differential equations.  Such methods are 
              appropriate in a parallel computing environment and have been  successfully
              used for time domain analysis of large dynamical  systems.      Jackiewicz and
              Bellen are specialists in waveform relaxation  methods, which aim to develop
              effective numerical methods for  systems of ordinary differential equations. 
              The topic area is  important because systems of ordinary differential equations
               arise naturally in modeling a variety of important physical,  biological, and
              geological phenomena and in many industrial  applications.  This collaboration
              allows the Italian expertise in  parallel methods for differential equations to
              be complemented by  Jackiewicz's experience in general linear methods for 
              differential equations.  This should lead to a better  understanding of
              numerical solution of ordinary differential  equations in a parallel computing
              environment.  * * *
