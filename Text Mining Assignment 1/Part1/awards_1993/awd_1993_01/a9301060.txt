Abstract    :
                   The research involves studying a number of questions in                   
              minimal surface theory and harmonic maps.  These mainly concern                
              moduli studies relative to the intrinsic analytic and topological              
              properties of the surfaces:  their conformal structure and genus               
              in particular.  Rigidity questions are also proposed as well as                
              constructions of classes of minimal tori in the complex                        
              projective plane using methods of soliton theory and algebraic                 
              geometry.
