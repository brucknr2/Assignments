Abstract    :
                Combinatorial pattern matching encompasses a large class of  problems that are
              now emerging in several application areas.  The most important  application
              areas are molecular biology  where a myriad of pattern-matching  problems
              occur, and test  processing in the larger context of storing,  manipulating, 
              searching, and information gathering from large collections  of  texts.  For
              example, the need for approximate pattern  matching is expected to  grow as
              more and more text is being  read by OCR (Optical Character Recognition) 
              devices which  often make errors.  This project studies  fundamental issues in
              combinatorial pattern matching that are   motivated by these two application
              areas.  Theory and practice are interleaved   in this project with practical
              problems motivating most of the  theoretical questions and, in at least two
              cases, the other way around.    The potential contributions of this work
              include the identification,   abstraction, and unification of important
              problems in this area,   and the development of algorithms and software tools
              for their solutions.
