Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project is a two-year effort to initiate the development             
              of vapor filters for lidar measurements in the mesopause region.               
              It proposes two different types of vapor filters whose use will add            
              new measurement capabilities to the narrowband Na fluorescence                 
              lidar.  First is a narrow band-pass filter based on Faraday                    
              dispersion in Na vapor near resonance.  This filter has an                     
              effective bandwidth of approximately 2 GHz, 85% peak transmission,             
              and wide field-of-view.  When used at a Fraunhofer line, it can                
              reject sky background light more effectively than a Fabry-Perot                
              system by more than a factor of 50, making the daytime operation of            
              the Na temperature lidar practical.  Second is a temperature                   
              stabilized iodine vapor cell to be used as a transmission filter.              
              The transmittance of the I2 vapor cell as a function of frequency              
              varies considerably within a few GHz.  Since elastically scattered             
              and Na fluorescence signals occur at different frequencies, a                  
              comparison of lidar returns at the two operating frequencies, v2               
              and vc, with and without passing through the I2 vapor cell will                
              provide enough information for the determination of temperature and            
              quantification of elastic scattering.  Therefore, the use of a well            
              characterized iodine vapor filter with a Na temperature lidar in               
              the polar cap region will allow simultaneous monitoring of                     
              temperature profiles and noctilucent clouds.
