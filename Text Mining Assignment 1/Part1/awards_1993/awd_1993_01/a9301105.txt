Abstract    :
              9301105  O'Sullivan       Under this award the Principal Investigator will
              investigate  various aspects of middle atmospheric dynamics using two global 
              circulation models.  The first topic involves the secondary  circulations which
              result from the cross-equatorial flow that  results from inertial instabilities
              in the stratospheric flows.   Better definition of these circulations is
              essential to understand  vertical diffusion of atmospheric constituents.  The
              second  investigation will be into inertia-gravity wave generation and 
              subsequent effects on the polar vortex and transports in and out of  the
              vortex.  Results are important to understanding the chemistry  that occurs
              within the vortex, including ozone depletion.  The  third task is to explore
              the relationship between the quasi-  biennial oscillation and interannual
              variability of stratospheric  ozone at high latitudes.  Finally, Dr. O'Sullivan
              will attempt to  model the tropospheric-stratospheric response to large-scale 
              localized tropical heating, that is, deep convection such as that  found over
              the western tropical Pacific.    ***
