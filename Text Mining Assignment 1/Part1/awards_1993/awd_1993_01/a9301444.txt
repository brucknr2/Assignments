Abstract    :
              9357463  Scully        Factors controlling the passivity and corrosion of 
              intermetallic compounds in aqueous solutions are examined using  nickel
              aluminides and titanium aluminides as model systems.  A  parallel investigation
              is pursued on intergranular separation in  polycrystalline metallic materials
              using bond percolation theory.   Model materials are available from industry
              and also can be  prepared by rapid solidification, co-sputter deposition, or
              ion  implantation.  Structure and composition are characterized by  scanning
              electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction and  electrochemical properties
              characterized by several techniques,  including AC and DC electrochemistry and
              solution analysis.  %%%       Corrosion and passivity mechanisms are
              unclarified for  emerging structural intermetallic materials proposed for
              structural  applications as well as those formed in microelectronic processing.
                This research should clarify these mechanisms and lead to  procedures for
              predicting electrochemical properties.  ***
