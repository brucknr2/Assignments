Abstract    :
              Higher, thicker landfills with steeper side slopes raise                       
              legitimate concerns about slope stability and liner integrity,                 
              particularly during earthquakes. The most important landfill                   
              properties for seismic safety are moduli and shear strength. The               
              objective of this research is: a. to investigate techniques for                
              characterization of landfills and other highly nonhomogeneous                  
              materials containing large aggregate; b. develop correlations                  
              between seismic velocity measurements and landfill shear strength              
              measurements, and use these correlations to develop three-                     
              dimensional profile of shear strength variation within a landfill              
              section; c. apply the methodology to one existing landfill.
