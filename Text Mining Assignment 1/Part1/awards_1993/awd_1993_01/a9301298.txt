Abstract    :
              \9301298  Wong    Iodine can be found in seawater as IO3- and I- although I- is 
              thermodynamically unstable relative to IO3.  Although iodine is the  most
              abundant  biophilic minor element in the ocean and the  distribution of IO3-
              and I- in the open oceans are relatively well  known, direct evidence on the
              processes that may control its  speciation is largely incomplete.  Preliminary
              data from the South  Atlantic Bight and East China Sea suggest that IO3- may be
              reduced  to I- preferentially in the shelf-seas.  Within the shelf, the 
              reduction may be especially efficient in the inner shelf and the  adjoining
              marshes and lagoons.  Thus, during the exchanges between  the marginal seas and
              the ocean interior, IO3- rich water may be  added to the shelf while I- rich
              water may be exported to the ocean  interior. This model will be tested with
              additional field  observations to assess the relative importance of biological
              and  non-biological processes in controlling the reduction of IO3-.
