Abstract    :
              9301199  Safinya  Synchrotron based small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering
              methods  will be used to characterize the structure, phase-behavior, and 
              interlayer (in lamellar preparations) and inter-macromolecular  interactions,
              and the protein shape stability of (1) native and  reconstituted self-assembled
              membrane proteins, (2) functionalized  biomolecular interfaces, and (3) a new
              material which will be based  on membrane proteins complexed with associating
              polymers.  The  project is an interdisciplinary effort involving experiment and
               theory.  The theory will use statistical mechanics techniques to  address the
              phase bahavior and mechanics of membranes with internal  degrees of freedom, as
              well as to examine fundamental issues  underlying self association in complex
              fluids.  %%%  X-ray techniques employing radiation from synchrotron light
              sources  will be used to investigate the structure and dynamics of complexes 
              involving proteins (separated from native membranes) which are  associated with
              polymers or other molecules, or surfaces.  The  objective is to develop a new
              environment, such as a nest of  polymer molecules, with which the membrane
              protein will associate.   If such an association structure is developed, it
              would represent  a new "biomolecular" material which could trap photoactive and
               other membrane molecules in a three-dimensional network.  Such a   structure
              may be useful as a memory storage element, biosensor or  other system.  The
              project is interdisciplinary and involves both  a theory and an experimental
              component.  ***
