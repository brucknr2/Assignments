Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For marine animals with the capacity of producing large number of              
              offsprings and high average mortalities of early life stages, there            
              exists the potential for a large variance in the success with which            
              individual contribute offspring to the next generation of                      
              reproducing adults.  For these animals, an assumption of  binomial             
              variance in offspring numbers is likely wrong, and that a small                
              minority of offsprings may replace an entire population in each                
              generation when there is a mismatch between reproductive activity              
              and permissive oceanographic conditions.  To examine this                      
              hypothesis, a model oyster population Crassostrea gigas in Dabob               
              Bay, WA, for which a 30-year record exists on reproductive activity            
              and recruitment success, will be tested rigorously by comparison of            
              genetic diversity among larvae, juveniles, and adults.  Genetic                
              diversity studies of larval populations are now made possible by               
              advances in molecular biology.  Large variance in reproductive                 
              success may be a major factor in the population biology, adaptation            
              and speciation of most marine animals.
