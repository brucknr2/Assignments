Abstract    :
              We seek to develop reliable automatic structural nonparametric  estimators of
              densities and hazards on multidimensional domains.   The structure, ANOVA
              decomposition of functions, can be built in  via tensor product splines.  For
              density estimation, the  structure allows conditional independence to be built
              into  multivariate densities; for hazard estimation, it yields survival  models
              more general than, but reducible to, proportional hazard  models.  The targeted
              results are asymptotic theory and automatic  algorithms implemented in portable
              public domain code.  Our  research is on the estimation (reconstruction) of
              curves/surfaces  based on imperfect data collected in designed experiments or 
              other scientific studies.  The curves/surfaces to be  reconstructed may
              represent geographical distribution of acid  rain deposition as is useful for
              environmental monitoring, or may  characterize the effectiveness of medical
              treatments in clinical  trials, etc.  Prior results of the research have found 
              applications in modeling weather data, environmental data, and  AIDS data.
