Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides partial support for the 1993 Gordon Research               
              Conference on Temperature Stress in Plants, which will be held at              
              the Casa Sirena MarinaHotel, Oxnard, California on February 1-5,               
              1993.  Funds will be used to partially defray the travel expenses              
              of invited speakers, session chairs, and junior scientists                     
              (graduate students and postdoctoral researchers).                              
                                                                                             
              This is the fifth meeting of the Gordon Research Conference on                 
              Temperature Stress in Plants, which began in 1984 and has met                  
              biennially since 1989. Sessions are scheduled in the areas of                  
              freezing, chilling and high temperature stress and will include                
              presentations ranging from whole plant responses to gene                       
              regulation.  In addition, a session on global climate change will              
              be featured at the 1993 Conference.  A goal of these sessions will             
              be to delineate the crucial interations of temperature stress and              
              other environmental variables that are needed to predict likely                
              responses of natural ecosystems and crop species at regional/global            
              scales and to identify realistic goals that can be achieved in                 
              modifying plant species to improve their tolerance to temperature              
              stresses.  Such assessments, which require input of scientists                 
              working at all levels within thecontinuum of research on                       
              temperature stress, are crucial to policy-makers who seek                      
              information about the future of natural ecosystems and agricultural            
              productivity.
