Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professors Goss and Shu to            
              work in the area of function fields.  Professor Goss will continue             
              his research on L-series of Drinfeld modules over more general                 
              Dedekind rings of characteristic p and on Mellin and Fourier                   
              transforms.  Professor Shu will work on the arithmetic of Drinfeld             
              modules and associated eta values.                                             
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
