Abstract    :
                Electroplating of fasteners generates large amounts of solid and             
              liquid waste.  A unique dry plating method has been developed to               
              address this concern.  This method eliminates liquid chemicals and             
              minimizes solid waste.  A process model has been successfully                  
              developed that predicts the cumulative effect of independent                   
              process variables on the deposition rate and the grain size.  The              
              data generated has indicated that the dry plating is a promising               
              and safe alternative to electrochemical plating.                               
                   A cadmium dry plating apparatus suitable for plating fasteners            
              will be developed and the environmental and occupational safety                
              standards of this process will be investigated.  The dry plating               
              process will be developed and modeled to study the quality of the              
              coatings which are needed in the fastener industry.  If this                   
              quality can be obtained in an environmentally safe manner, the dry             
              plating has a substantial potential for plating large quantities               
              of fasteners.
