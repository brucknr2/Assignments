Abstract    :
                   This proposal intends to study the recently found important               
              role of hole trapping in perovskite structure titanates.    As a               
              result of hole trapping and its consequences, insulating material              
              may be obtained after equilibrium at lower partial oxygen pressure             
              than previously considered possible.    This proposed program will             
              focaus on undoped and acceptor-doped BaTiO3  and SrTiO3, and will              
              conduct experiments to further the understanding of the equilibrium            
              defect chemistry of the perovskite titanates and its rel;ationship             
              to properties of technological interest.  Second part of the                   
              proposed program will be focussed on the defect chemistry and                  
              charge transport of perovskite-related oxides, specifically of the             
              brownmillerite A2B2O5 structure and based on indium, gallium, and              
              related elements.                                                              
              %%%                                                                            
                   This proposed study pursues the recently found important role             
              of hole trapping in perovskite related oxides.  It has significant             
              implications with respect to the multilayer ceramic capacitor                  
              market.  This study aims to pursue the investigation into to the               
              defect chemistry and its relationship to properties of                         
              technological interest.  Second part of this study will investigate            
              the origin of the high levels of ionic conductivity in oxygen-                 
              deficient variants of the perovskite structure such as the                     
              brownmillerite structure of A2B2O5.  This study will have important            
              contributions to the understanding of materials used in devices of             
              technological importance.
