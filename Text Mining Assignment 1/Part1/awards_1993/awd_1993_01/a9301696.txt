Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research project include the reprocessing of            
              a high-quality 3-D multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection data set              
              collected across the Costa Rica margin accretionary prism, and                 
              subsequent reinterpretation of the prism's structure,                          
              geomorphology, and geohydrology.  Advances in MCS data processing              
              techniques, and increasing interest in the internal structure of               
              accretionary prisms make this project of timely importance.  In                
              addition to answering fundamental questions concerning the nature              
              of structures within the Costa Rica accretionary prism, the                    
              reprocessed seismic data will be used as background information for            
              future Ocean Drilling Project activities in the Costa Rica margin              
              area.
