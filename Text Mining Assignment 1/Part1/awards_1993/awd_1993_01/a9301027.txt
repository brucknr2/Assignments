Abstract    :
              Dr. Sandra Greer is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                  
              and Computational Chemistry Program to continue her research                   
              involving structure, thermodynamics, kinetics and dynamics of                  
              organic molecules undergoing equilibrium polymerization.  In                   
              equilibrium polymerization, the monomers begin to polymerize as                
              the temperature is lowered through the polymerization                          
              temperature and then grow in length as the temperature is                      
              lowered further.  If the temperature is raised, the polymers                   
              shorten and eventually revert to monomers on passing back                      
              through the polymerization temperature.  Systems undergoing                    
              equilibrium polymerization are referred to as "living                          
              polymers".  Microscopic studies will employ neutron scattering                 
              as well as light scattering to investigate the structure of                    
              solutions and the motion of polymer molecules in them.                         
              Macroscopic studies will include characterization of                           
              thermodynamic properties such as density, heat capacity, phase                 
              diagrams as well as transport properties such as viscosity and                 
              stress relaxation.                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Equilibrium polymerization is a major avenue for the synthesis                 
              of novel polymers with unique material properties.  These                      
              systems also provide a wonderful means for studying the                        
              microscopic structure of polymer solutions as a function of                    
              polymer molecular weight since the polymer size can be                         
              regulated by adjusting the temperature.  Dr. Greer's research                  
              will provide significant insights into the molecular level                     
              explanation for the dynamics and thermodynamics of living                      
              polymer systems.
