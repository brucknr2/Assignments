Abstract    :
                   The projects seeks to investigate the combined use of robust              
              feedback control based on estimation of disturbances such as                   
              cutting forces, low-velocity friction compensation, and feedforward            
              control based on inverse dynamics of machine feed drive systems,               
              and the integration of these control schemes with standard Computer            
              Numerical Control (CNC) functions on a laboratory personal                     
              computer.  A machining center will be used as a test bed for                   
              demonstrating the control schemes and their integration.                       
                   The resulting system will be a prototype turnkey system, which            
              makes it possible for machine tool developers, programmers and                 
              operators to receive the full benefit of advanced controls without             
              specialized knowledge of machine tool dynamics and control theory.             
              It is expected that this project will have a significant impact in             
              the highly competitive area of high-speed machining.
