Abstract    :
                   Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests support from               
              NSF for connection of the Vermont State Colleges which includes:               
              Castleton State College, Johnson State College, Lyndon State                   
              College, Vermont Technical College, and the Community College of               
              Vermont; the University of New Haven; New Hampshire College and                
              the Graduate School of Business; University of New England, and                
              Salve Regina University to the New England Academic Research                   
              Network (Nearnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that serves               
              the New England area.  A primary goal of NEARnet is to facilitate              
              collaborative projects and sharing of resources between                        
              institution, including those outside the state.                                
                   NEARnet will provide operations management and information                
              services and it will give the universities and colleges a                      
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per              
              second) National Backbone network.                                             
                   The each of the universities has written a description of                 
              its organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet                   
              access that it expects including: greater functionality and                    
              network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and              
              make file transfers along with being able to implement a more                  
              reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit               
              from the links.  This is also a unique opportunity for the                     
              schools to explore innovative educational resources.  Their                    
              diversity will expose NEARnet to a broader range of user                       
              requirements.  Nearnet will use the information obtained by                    
              serving this diverse group for the benefit of New England's                    
              academic and research community.
