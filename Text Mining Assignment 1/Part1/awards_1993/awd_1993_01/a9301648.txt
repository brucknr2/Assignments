Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the               
              fundamental nature of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) displayed in               
              periodic multilayers and single layer alloy thin films.  The main              
              effort is on optimizing GMR in cobalt-silver multilayers and co-               
              sputtered alloy films.  The multilayer variables include layer                 
              thickness, layer number, buffer layer materials, and annealing heat            
              treatment.  Co-sputtered film variables include the cobalt/silver              
              concentrations and sputtering pressure.  Effects of third elemental            
              additions are to be determined.  Structure, magnetoresistance, and             
              general magnetic properties are measured using a variety of                    
              techniques.  Also emphasized is computer simulation of the GMR                 
              behavior using a Monte Carlo approach to microstructural evolution.

              This research on magnetoresistance in thin films and multilayers is            
              pertinent to the development of magnetic field sensors, such as                
              read heads in magnetic recording technology.
