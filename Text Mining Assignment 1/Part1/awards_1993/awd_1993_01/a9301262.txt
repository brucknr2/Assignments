Abstract    :
                   Theoretical work in a varied set of mathematical problems in              
              continuum mechanics will be carried out.  These include: a)                    
              nonlinear wave propagation in viscoelastic media; b) sheets with               
              bending stiffness, and c) quasiconvexification stored energy                   
              function in membrane structures.  The aim is to provide a                      
              coherent general theory of large deformation of membranes and                  
              networks (such as cloth and cable networks) and to develop                     
              approximate methods for the solution of boundary-value problems                
              within this theory.                                                            
                   This research has impact on the new technologies in civil                 
              and mechanical engineering.
