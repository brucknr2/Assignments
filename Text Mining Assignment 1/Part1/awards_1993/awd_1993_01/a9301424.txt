Abstract    :
                   King's College requests support from NSF for connection of its            
              campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network located            
              in the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide operations                 
              management and information services and it will give operations                
              management and information services and it will give King's College            
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per              
              second) National Backbone network.                                             
                   The university needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
