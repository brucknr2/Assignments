Abstract    :
                   The overall objectives of this research program are to                    
              synthesize novel precursors containing metal-sulfur linkages; to               
              develop a fundamental understanding of the molecular processes                 
              involved in the formation of precursors and structural evolution of            
              the sulfide ceramics; and, to correlate the precursor chemistry                
              with the microstructure and optical properties of the dense                    
              ceramic.  Cubic lanthanum sulfide is selected as the representative            
              system in the studies.  Other sulfides, such as titanium sulfide,              
              zinc sulfide, and gallium sulfide, can also be selected for this               
              study.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
                   This proposed research aims to use modified metal alkoxide and            
              metal thioalkoxide to synthesize sulfide ceramics of reactive                  
              metals which have strong affinity for oxygen.  These metals include            
              lanthanum, titanium, zinc, and gallium.  This studies will seek                
              fundamental understandings of the molecular processes involved in              
              the formation of precursors and the subsequent evolution of sulfide            
              ceramics.  This study shall enhance our knowledge in the area of               
              controlled chemical synthesis of non-oxide sulfide ceramics.
