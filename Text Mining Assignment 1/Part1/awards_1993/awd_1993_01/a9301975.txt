Abstract    :
              The kinematic properties and synthesis of single and multiple                  
              degrees-of-freedom pencil trajectories are investigated in this                
              research project. Whereas a line trajectory is one in which the                
              tracing element follows a line, in the case of a pencil                        
              trajectory, both the line and the position of a point on the line              
              are included. It is therefore feasible to control the movement of              
              the tip of the pencil and the orientation of the pencil. For a                 
              single degree-of-motion a pencil trajectory may be regarded as a               
              point trajectory on a ruled surface. Typical applications of such              
              motions requiring control of a pencil include drilling, screwing,              
              welding, cutting, drawing, and laser or water jet positioning. In              
              the area of design and manufacturing, results from this research               
              provide an integrated treatment of both the direction and                      
              position of a line segment, there by eliminating the unnecessary               
              constraint of a rigid body motion. This leads to a considerable                
              simplification for the pencil trajectory synthesis and planning.               
              The simplification is especially valuable when the number of                   
              degrees of freedom is limited to achieve high speed, high                      
              precision, easy of operation, and low cost.***//
