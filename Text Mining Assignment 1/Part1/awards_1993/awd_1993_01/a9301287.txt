Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9301287  Robert H. Page    A new concept to utilize the non-steady
              impinging jet from a self oscillating nozzle is proposed.  Enhancing the
              surface heat transfer due to a submerged jet impingement is to be studied
              theoretically and experimentally.  The concept centers around the potential of
              modifying standard in-line jet nozzles such that they become self oscillating
              and have the ability to force an oscillating boundary layer development on the
              impingement surface.  It is believed that this agitated surface boundary layer
              occurrence can be exploited to increase the heat transfer from an impinging
              jet.  The Infrared Heat Transfer Jet Impingement Facility (HJIF) at Texas A&M
              University will be used for the experimental studies of the impingement.  The
              objective will be to obtain a better understanding of this non-steady phenomena
              in order that it can be applied to this physical situation to improve the heat
              transfer as well as to gain the necessary enlightenment about self oscillating
              or resonant flows, such that the knowledge may have future use for additional
              surface boundary layer interaction conditions involving mass transfer and
              chemical reactions.
