Abstract    :
                   This project will study a diverse set of questions in games               
              theory: a) Do Nash equilibria exist for single controller and                  
              switching controller games in arbitrary state spaces? b) Do ARAT               
              games and switching control games admit stationary Nash                        
              equilibrium for undiscounted games?  c) Characterize multi-choice              
              nucleolus by suitably defining Sobolev's reduced subgames; d)                  
              Find an efficient algorithm to solve for the nucleolus of flow                 
              games, linearly constrained games, and homogeneous games.

                   Methods, techniques and ideas of games theory have                        
              applications to economics, operations research, queuing theory,                
              and control theory.
