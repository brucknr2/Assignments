Abstract    :
                  9301504   Mullen        The theory of finite fields can be traced back to 
              Gauss and Galois and it currently plays an important role in  several branches
              of mathematics.  In recent years there has  been a resurgence of research in
              finite fields due to the  wide variety of applications of the theoretical
              aspects of  finite fields.  Many exciting new theoretical results have  been
              obtained by a growing number of mathematicians world  wide.  Many new
              applications and algorithms of finite fields  have been discovered.  Even
              though there have been special  conferences devoted exclusively to applications
              or  algorithms of finite fields, there are no conferences  devoted to the
              combination of the theory, algorithms and  applications.  It is clear that
              there is an increasing  interaction among the three different groups of people.
               The  proposed conference encourages this interaction.  It is  anticipated that
              the conference will result in many more  fruitful applications of finite fields
              and at the same time  provide new problems and motivation for fintie field
              theory.
