Abstract    :
              9301962 Bertero The Landers EQ of June 28 was the largest EQ in California since
              1952, with a magnitude of 7.4 and a significant set of strong motion recordings
              both in the free field and in buildings.  It was preceded by the Joshua Tree
              and Big Bear earthquakes in April.  The data recorded from these earthquakes
              present an excellent opportunity to study the effect of long duration multiple
              occurrence of strong ground motions on structural response.  More specifically
              the objectives of this study is to:  (1) evaluate the damage potential of these
              recently recorded recent Southern California earthquakes, (2) evaluate the
              effects of multiple EQs on the mechanical characteristics of different
              instrumented structures whose responses were recorded, (3) evaluate the effects
              of long duration strong ground motion on various structural systems and to
              correlate this with the response to long duration ground motions recorded
              outside of the U.S., (4) assess the implications of the results obtained with
              respect to the present state of the practice regarding the seismic design
              coefficient, Cd, and the structural system coefficient, Rw, as currently used
              by building codes, (5) attempt to formulate a better procedure for establishing
              the design EQ than is currently being used, (6) compare the analytically
              predicted building characteristics and performance to both the recorded and the
              observed behavior in order to calibrate:  the actual stiffness, the strength
              (particularly the resulting overstrength to that required by present codes),
              the torsional effects, the soil structure interaction effects, the
              deformational response parameters, the probable energy dissipation capacity of
              these  structures and their damage indices, (7) evaluate      h)         
              0*0*0*         further the application of inelastic response spectra and energy
              considerations for earthquake resistant design of building structures, and to
              quantify the concepts of yield resistance, seismic coefficient and design
              ductility for application to building code requirements, (8) evaluate the
              reliability and practical application of a nonlinear static loading procedure
              to earthquake resistance design, (9) formulate an equivalent SDOF model of the
              actual multi degree of freedom system that can be used to analyze the
              performance of the structure under earthquake motions at all levels, (10)
              attempt to formulate guidelines for the selection of efficient strategies and
              techniques for the seismic upgrading of buildings that the conducted studies
              have shown to be potentially hazardous in case of future severe EQGMs. ***
