Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              129I: A New Tracer For Carbon Cycling                                          
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Since the beginning of the nuclear age (circa 1945) human                      
              activities have greatly increased the environmental levels of the              
              radio-iosotope of iodine (129I). Much of this radioactivity has                
              collected in the surface layers of the ocean, where levels have                
              been raised by at least a factor of 200 above the pre-nuclear                  
              activity levels.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Iodine is incorporated into organic matter as it forms, so this                
              increased 129I activity will accompany freshly formed organics and             
              distinguish them from pre-nuclear. Except during primary                       
              production, the great majority of iodine in the biota is derived               
              through the food chain, and not by direct uptake from seawater.                
              Therefore past values of the ongoing build-up should be recorded in            
                                                                                             
              archived biological specimens.  If, in a particular region, we can             
              document the history of 129I concentration in the surface ocean                
              waters, and in surface ocean biota that are the source of carbon               
              (and iodine) for almost the entire food web below, then we may be              
              able to identify the year-class of iodine present in all post-bomb             
              marine  organic matter in that region, and thereby iodine date the             
              organic matter. This approach could then be extended to any other              
              region where suitable archives exist.                                          
                                                                                             
              This work will establish past and present 129I values within the               
              waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  These levels are below detection by             
              all commonly employed measurement techniques but are approximately             
              100,000 times the sensitivity limits when Accelerator Mass                     
              Spectrometry (AMS) is employed. The AMS group of the University of             
              Rochester will make these measurements.
