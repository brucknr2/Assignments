Abstract    :
                9301719  O'Day    This U.S.-Chile award will support Dr. Peter O'Day,  of the
              University of Oregon, Eugene, in a research  collaboration with Dr. Juan
              Bacigalupo, of the  University of Chile.  The researchers will  investigate the
              gating of light-activated channels  in Drosophila photoreceptors and test the
              concept  that there is more than one biochemical pathway  involved in
              transduction.        The mechanism by which light is transduced to an 
              electrical signal is still unclear.  The overall  goal of the research is to
              enhance our understanding  of visual transduction in Drosophila photoreceptors 
              and the activation and modulation of transduction  pathways.  Because of its
              similarities to other  biological systems, and because it can be  genetically
              manipulated as well as electro-  physiologically studied, the use of Drosophila
              as a  model system will provide important clues to similar  issues in cellular
              signalling in general.  ***
