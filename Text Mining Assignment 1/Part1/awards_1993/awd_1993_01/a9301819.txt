Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Laboratory and numerical investigations of the dynamics of ocean               
              circulation will be conducted.  The central focus is the combined              
              effect of different external forcing mechanisms, such as sea                   
              surface buoyancy flux and stresses, and stresses at the sea floor.             
              Several poorly understood physical mechanisms of importance to                 
              ocean general circulation models like the subduction of mixed layer            
              fluid, the recirculation between the mixed layer and the interior,             
              and the effect of sloping boundary layer on deep western boundary              
              currents will be studied.
