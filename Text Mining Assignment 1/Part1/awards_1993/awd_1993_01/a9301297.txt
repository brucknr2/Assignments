Abstract    :
                   Graceland College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via              
              a 56,000 bits per second line.  The connection enables the school's            
              faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with the                   
              international scientific and educational community, and to access              
              network resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers.             
              This award funds part of the costs for two years.
