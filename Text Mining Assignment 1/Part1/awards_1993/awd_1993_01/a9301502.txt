Abstract    :
                   The investigator will proceed with his research on iterated               
              quadratic polynomials relative to hyperbolic dynamical systems                 
              and analysis of components of the Mandelbrot set.  Dynamical                   
              systems on algebraic surfaces (K-3 type) and structural studies                
              of Teichmueller space-Bers boundary-using complex analytic                     
              techniques will also be investigated.
