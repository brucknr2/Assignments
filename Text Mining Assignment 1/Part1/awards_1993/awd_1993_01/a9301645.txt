Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The University of Delaware will operate the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN             
              during 1993 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-               
              supported research projects. The HENLOPEN is a 120' general                    
              research vessel owned by the University.  The vessel is scheduled              
              for a total of 164 operational days during 1993, of which 130 are              
              in support of NSF-supported investigators. The remaining cruises               
              will support Navy projects. The projects scheduled  on the HENLOPEN            
              span all oceanographic disciplines and will utilize the                        
              capabilities of the vessel. All operations are along the U.S. mid-             
              Atlantic coast, including Delaware and Chesapeake Bays and coastal             
              water of New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland.//
