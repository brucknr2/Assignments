Abstract    :
              This award will support U.S. participants in a                                 
              multilateral workshop on the representation theory of                          
              algebraic groups, to be held in Santiago and                                   
              Valparaiso, Chile from July 24 to August 6, 1993. The                          
              workshop, which is being organized by Dr. Philip                               
              Kutzko, University of Iowa and Drs. J. Soto-Andrade,                           
              University of Chile and J.R. Baeza, University of                              
              Valparaiso, involves many different fields of                                  
              mathematics and is of great interest, both for its                             
              connections with number theory via the Langlands                               
              program and for its relevance to general                                       
              representation theoretic investigations of topological                         
              groups.  The lectures delivered in this workshop will                          
              be edited into a comprehensive basic graduate text,                            
              which will provide an overview of concepts and                                 
              techniques of the field.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The representation theory is an area which has                                 
              attracted considerable attention in recent years.                              
              This workshop will provide a forum for the exchange of                         
              recent research among mathematicians from several                              
              nations working in this very important area. It will                           
              also serve to encourage further research collaboration                         
              between Chilean and U.S. mathematicians.
