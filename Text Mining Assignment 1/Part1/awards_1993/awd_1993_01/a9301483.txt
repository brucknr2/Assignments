Abstract    :
              Nick Pugliano has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                         
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Pugliano's doctoral degree was                    
              from the University of California-Berkeley under the                           
              supervision of Professor Richard Saykally. Dr. Pugliano will                   
              continue research at the University of Pennsylvania under the                  
              sponsorship of Professor Robin Hochstrasser. Dr. Pugliano's                    
              postdoctoral training will provide him with skills and                         
              experience in studying condensed phase reaction dynamics using                 
              ultrafast pump/probe techniques. Longer term he plans to                       
              investigate the reaction dynamics of ?2+2! photocycloadditions                 
              of ketones with olefins by ultrafast transient infrared                        
              absorption spectroscopy.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
