Abstract    :
              Johnson         Rice University is establishing a two-part database composed  of
              sampled signals and signal processing software with the Signal  Processing
              Society serving as the gatekeeper. This database will  be accessible through
              the InterNet at no charge to users. Data  and programs are being solicited from
              university, industrial, and  military sources. The data will provide a needed
              testbed for  evaluation of signal processing algorithms; the software will 
              provide the signal processing community with state-of-the-art  algorithms and
              simulation systems.
