Abstract    :
              9301447  Carta  This research project is to investigate  chemical syntheses
              using immobilized enzymes  in organic media.  A major goal is to develop  a
              bioreactor system which can be used  efficiently for large-volume production. 
              The  proposed bioreactor is an integrated system in  which enzymatic conversion
              and separation  occur simultaneously.  As a result, the  conversion can have
              values greater than the  limits imposed by thermodynamic equilibrium in 
              conventional reactors.  Also, the nearly  continuous and simultaneous removal
              of water,  which occurs with the proposed reactor system,  should reduce the
              inhibitory and denaturing  effects that water has on these enzyme-  catalyzed
              condensation reactions.  In  addition, mathematical models will be used to 
              extend the reactor system to other reactions.
