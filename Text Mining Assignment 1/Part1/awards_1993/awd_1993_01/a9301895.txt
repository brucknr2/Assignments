Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will establish a visiting scientist program at the                  
              Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar facility for atmospheric               
              scientists from the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  The purpose of this            
              program is to further the aims of US researchers involved with the             
              Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR)               
              program, an element of Global Change.  The visiting scientist                  
              program will facilitate the interaction of CEDAR researchers with              
              the resources and talents that exist in related research areas in              
              the FSU.  Over the course of three years a total of nine FSU                   
              scientists will visit the Millstone Hill facility with each visit              
              lasting about three months.  Research topics to be addressed                   
              include radiowave probing of the coupled ionosphere/thermosphere               
              systems which is the primary focus of CEDAR related activities at              
              Millstone Hill.
