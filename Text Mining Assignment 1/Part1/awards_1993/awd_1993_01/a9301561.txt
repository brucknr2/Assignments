Abstract    :
                   The Massachusetts public higher education system requests                 
              support from NSF for connection of Greenfield Community College,               
              Massachusetts Bay Community College, Massasoit Community College,              
              Springfield Technical Community College, Massachusetts Maritime                
              Academy, and Westfield State College through MassNet and the New               
              England Academic Research Network (NEARnet) which is the NSF mid-              
              level network that serves the New England area.  A primary goal                
              of NEARnet is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of              
              resources between institution, including those outside the state.              
                   NEARnet will provide operations management and information                
              services and it will give the universities and colleges a                      
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per              
              second) National Backbone network.                                             
                   The each of the universities has written a description of                 
              its organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet                   
              access that it expects including: greater functionality and                    
              network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and              
              make file transfers along with being able to implement a more                  
              reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit               
              from the links.  This is also a unique opportunity for the                     
              schools to explore innovative educational resources.  Their                    
              diversity will expose NEARnet to a broader range of user                       
              requirements.  Nearnet will use the information obtained by                    
              serving this diverse group for the benefit of New England's                    
              academic and research community.
