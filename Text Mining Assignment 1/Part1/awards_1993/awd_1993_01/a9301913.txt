Abstract    :
              Laptop and notebook computers are two examples of the many                     
              applications that require low-power, low-volume mass storage.  A               
              prior SBIR Phase I research grant examined the feasibility of                  
              replacing hard disk drives with 3D packaged solid state memory.                
              Specifically, this effort verified that a two inch by three inch               
              by one-fifth inch PCMCIA type 2 memory card can provide 256                    
              megabytes of memory with less than one microsecond access time and             
              negligible power consumption.  This capability can be provided cost            
              effectively both as a standard hard drive and as main memory.  This            
              Phase II project develops and demonstrates a laboratory prototype              
              of a 256 megabyte memory card that includes the active components              
              required for data formatting, input-output drivers, and control                
              logic, such that the memory card can be interfaced directly to                 
              existing laptop and notebook computers.
