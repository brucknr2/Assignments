Abstract    :
              9301100  Tsen  This experimental program will study the dynamics of carriers in 
              semiconductors under extreme non-equilibrium conditions.  A second  sub-project
              will investigate energy transfer processes in ionic  crystals.  Sub-picosecond
              time-resolved Raman spectroscopy will be  used to examine carrier transport
              under electic fields.  The  technique provides a direct, simple interpretation
              of the  experimental results, which will provide conclusive fundamental 
              information on ballistic transport as well as velocity overshoot  phenomena
              predicted theoretically in nanostructured semiconductors.   Study of various
              energy transfer processes in ionic crystals by  time-resolved Raman
              spectroscopy should provide direct information  about
              vibrational-to-vibrational energy transfer processes in a  model solid state
              system.  %%%  This experimental program will study the dynamics of
              semiconductor  electrons moving under the influence of high electric fields.  A
               second project will investigate how energy is transferred among the  various
              modes of vibration in an ionic crystal when it absorbs  light.  The information
              is of fundamental significance and is also  of technological significance.  It
              will aid in the design of better  and faster semiconductor devices of micron
              and submicron  dimensions.  The energy transfer processes are immediately
              relevant  to the design and utility of far infrared lasers used in photonics 
              and telecommunications applications.  ***
