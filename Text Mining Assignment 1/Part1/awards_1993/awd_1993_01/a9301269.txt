Abstract    :
                   The MOSAIC-PM (Machine-Tool, Open-System, Advanced Intelligent            
              Controller for Precision Manufacturing) is a broad-based integrated            
              program.  It includes the development of new algorithms which use              
              touch-trigger probes to simplify two-dimensional and three-                    
              dimensional fixturing, development and evaluation of sensor                    
              systems, effective burr removal using computer-vision guided                   
              deburring tools and the development of expert systems for set-up               
              planning and tolerance descriptions.  The laboratory system is                 
              based on a DecStation/VMEbus/Real-time Unix/C environment.                     
                   This research plans to integrate results so that a normal                 
              machine-tool becomes a mid-range precision machine.  If successful             
              this research will permit significant increases in machine-tool                
              precision with little extra cost.  This would lead to its use as               
              a relatively low cost manufacturing research platform and could                
              lead to a prototype of a next-generation controller for U.S.                   
              industry.
