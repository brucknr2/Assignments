Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for the                           
              International Symposium on Coherent States:  Past, Present,                    
              and Future to be held at Oak  Ridge, Tennessee during June                     
              14-17, 1993.  The NSF funds will provide support for about                     
              15 students to attend the symposium, where they will be able                   
              to interact with leading experts in the field.  Present at                     
              the symposium will be many of the theorists who are most                       
              active in investigating coherent-state phenomena, which have                   
              applicants in many fields of physics, including quantum                        
              optics, condensed-matter physics, particle physics, and                        
              nuclear physics.
