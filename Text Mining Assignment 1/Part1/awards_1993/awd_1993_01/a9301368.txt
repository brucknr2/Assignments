Abstract    :
              9301368  Karl    This project provides a deep-water, open ocean hydrostation as
              the  oligotrophic ocean benchmark for observing  and interpreting  physical and
              biogeochemical oceanic variability. Repeat field  measurements of a suite of
              core parameters are made on  approximately monthly intervals, as well as
              compilation of the data  and distribution to the scientific community. The
              current project  includes ongoing improvements to the measurements being made
              such  as the addition of a continuous hydroprofiling, extension of  selected
              HOTS cruises, continuation of the sediment trap mooring  and  added
              measurements of low-level ammonium determinations, and   bacterial production
              measurements using a new techniuque.  Related  grants awarded simultaneously
              with this one include Bidigare (OCE-  9315311) for pigment measurements, and
              Winn (OCE 9315312) for  inorganic CO2.  Continued work on HOTS will contribute
              to  understanding of the role of the oligotrophic ocean in the global  carbon
              cycle and to resolving the time scale of variations in  processes important to
              that cycle.
