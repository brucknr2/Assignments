              supports the research of Professor Yu to work in combinatorics.  Professor Yu
              proposes to study several fundamental topics in graph theory, some of which
              have theoretical interest in other areas of mathematical sciences and some of
              which have practical applications.  More precisely, he will study the Hamilton
              cycle problem and cycle cover problems, the problem of finding certain types of
              subgraphs in a given graph, which has applications to network designs, and the
              problem of characterizing certain planar graphs.      The research is in the
              general area of combinatorics.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient
              methods to study how discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of
              discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For example,
              the design of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the design of
              algorithms in computer science all deal with discrete objects, and this makes
              use of combinatorial research. ***
