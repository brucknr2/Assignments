Abstract    :
              9301384  Bautsch       The Seattle Community College District is establishing a 
              connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line.  The  connection serves
              three community colleges, one vocational  institute, and four educational
              centers.  It enables the faculty  and students to communicate and collaborate
              with the international  scientific and educational community, and to access
              network  resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers.  This 
              award funds part of the costs for two years.  ***
