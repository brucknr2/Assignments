Abstract    :
              9301577  Reed  The project will develop design strategies for  classes of
              structural systems whose damping is  significantly enhanced through the
              inclusion  of tuned liquid dampers (TLDs).  The study  will consider the
              damping requirements for the  serviceability vibrations caused by wind 
              pressures, as well as those induced by strong  ground shaking, rather than
              focusing on one  particular loading and behavior.  A method for  the design of
              the TLDs themselves will be also  developed which will be based on numerical 
              simulation models, laboratory exploration of  liquid sloshing problems,
              parametric studies  and examination of existing prototype TLDs.   The
              non-linear numerical models for the TLD  sloshing under strong ground shaking
              will be  developed in tandem with controlled laboratory  experiments involving
              a multi-disciplinary and  multi-institution approach.  This model will  be used
              to examine the reliability and design  optimization of the TLD.  The tank
              behavior of  single and multiple TLDs will be studied in  collaboration with a
              research group at the  University of Tokyo.  An improved  understanding of the
              effectiveness and  reliability of TLDs in controlling the effects  of extreme
              wind and other loads on structures  will result in safer structural systems of
              all  kinds.  ***
