Abstract    :
              Thunnell  9301413    Funds are provided to allow the PI to continue his study of
              the varved  sediments and sediment-trap material from the Gulf of California 
              collected during "normal and ElNino years. Sediment trap material will 
              document the seasonal cycle of sediment input into th Gulf and the 
              climatological factors that control this cycle during both norrnal and El  Nino
              conditions. From sediment core study the record of annual to decadal  scale
              climate changes will be constructed for the past 13 k years. The  proposed
              study has significance beyond the boundaries of the Gulf. It  will provide a
              detailed picture of the basin-wide impacts of climate  changes during normal
              conditions and the El-Nino perturbations.
