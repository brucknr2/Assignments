Abstract    :
              This research concerns the development of a diamond anvil cell                 
              (DAC) that will enable the attainment and accurate measurement of              
              static pressures above 1 TPa (10 Mbars).  (The current peak that               
              has been attained is 5.6 Mbars, exceeding that at the center of the            
              earth).  At such levels of static pressure, major changes in the               
              properties of materials take place (e.g., in binding and structure,            
              and in electronic behavior .. e.g., oxygen becomes metallic).  This            
              new, high-performance DAC (HPDAC) will allow studies of the                    
              properties and behavior of materials in pressure regimes never                 
              before achieved.  The main focus of the project will be to develop             
              and implement numerical simulation and optimization tools that can             
              be used for the best design of the HPDAC.  A combination of                    
              boundary element and finite element methods will be used to create             
              this simulation tool.  Numerical simulations of the operation of               
              the optimized HPDAC will be compared to experimental results and to            
              simulations based on other designs optimized heuristically.
