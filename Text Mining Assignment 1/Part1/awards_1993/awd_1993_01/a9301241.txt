Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with the representations of                       
              reductive groups in prime characteristic and of related                        
              infinitesimal groups, as well as of quantum groups at a root of                
              unity.  The principal investigator will investigate construction               
              of graded structures on representation categories of restricted                
              Lie algebras and their quantum analogues; explicit bounds for the              
              truth of Lusztig's conjecture and investigation of its failure                 
              for small primes; applications of deformation categories to get                
              more precise information on endomorphism algebras and projective               
              functors; and cohomology varieties for higher Frobenius kernels                
              and their quantum analogues.                                                   
                   A group is an algebraic structure with an operation defined               
              on it.  A group is called an algebraic group if its elements                   
              satisfy a polynomial identity.  Algebraic groups are important                 
              for several different areas of mathematics, as well as physics.
