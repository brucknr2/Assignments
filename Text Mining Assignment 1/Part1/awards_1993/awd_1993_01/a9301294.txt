Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main theme of this research is centered on microstructures                 
              formed in polymer systems by taking advantage of the interplay                 
              between functional groups, such as coulombic interactions.                     
              Although the studies start by using block copolymers in the absence            
              of coulombic interactions, i.e., neutral polymers, the creation of             
              microdomains of polymeric materials by introducing interactions,               
              such as electrostatic charges, will be emphasized.  The experiments            
              will be complemented by a collaboration with A. Khokhlov of Moscow             
              State University who will provide theoretical development on how               
              clusters and aggregations which form microdomains can be calculated            
              based on free-energy considerations.  The interplay of experimental            
              limitations and theoretical assumptions and approximations,                    
              including the use of well-defined polymer systems which are to be              
              synthesized in collaboration with D. G. Peiffer at Exxon and the               
              Institute of Organo-Element Compounds, Russian Academy of Sciences,            
              Moscow, is essential to providing a deeper understanding on the                
              formation of microstructures.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The research effort is related to the exploration of our                       
              understanding on how microstructures can be manipulated in polymer             
              systems in order to achieve specific macroscopic properties in                 
              existing polymer materials.
