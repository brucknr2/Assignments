Abstract    :
              9301845  Pedlosky    Theoretical and numerical work will be conducted on linear
              and non-  linear baroclinic waves in the ocean and atmosphere.  Of particular 
              interest are the role played by atmospheric coherent structures to  the
              phenomena of blocking and anomalous jet streaks and the effect  the termocline
              upwelling and boundary sources have on the  baroclinic structure of abyssal
              oceanic flows.
