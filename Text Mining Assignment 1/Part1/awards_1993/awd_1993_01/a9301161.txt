Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Cox to work in              
              algebraic geometry.  One of the problems that Professor Cox will               
              address will be the issue of assigning a coordinate ring to a                  
              toric variety in a natural way.  This ring should be a polynomial              
              ring and should depend only on the toric variety and not on a                  
              particular projective embedding.  Professor Cox has a suggested                
              construction which seems to have many of the needed properties.                
                   This research uses the techniques of algebraic geometry, one              
              of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had               
              a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                  
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                 
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                       
              robotics.
