Abstract    :
                   Salinas will continue his research on Toeplitz C*-algebras                
              over domains with non-abelian symmetries, spectral and C*-                     
              algebraic properties of Toeplitz operators on pseudoconvex                     
              domains, and weighted Wiener-Hopf operators on convex cones.                   
              Upmeier will continue his study of quantization theories in                    
              several complex variables with the main focus on new geometric                 
              situations.  He will also study new types of special functions                 
              arising in quantization theory, and deepen the connections with                
              microlocal analysis.                                                           
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
