Abstract    :
              9301313  Azzam       Grating diffraction has been central to spectroscopy and
              its  many application in virtually every branch of science and  technology.  In
              this project the domain of use of diffraction  gratings will be broadened to
              include spectroscopic polarimetry and  spectroscopic ellipsometry. 
              Specifically, the polarizing and  dispersive properties of multipe-beam grating
              diffraction will be  combined with high resolution detector arrays to realize
              new  Stokes-parameter spectrophotopolarimeter that is capable of time- 
              resolved and complete spectral polarization analysis without  employing any
              moving parts or modulators.  The development of such  an instrument will
              represent a major advance in fast  optoelectronics and is expected to have an
              important impact on many  fields, particularly in materials research.  As an
              application, we  will use grating diffraction spectroscopic ellipsometry for
              the  characterization, and studying the dynamic switching properties of 
              liquid-crystal films.  ***
