Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Understanding the flow of fluids through ocean sediments and crust             
              is a major objective of the Ocean Drilling Program. Such flow                  
              results in the alteration of crustal rocks, the transport of heat              
              and dissolved elements, and has a significant effect on the                    
              rheology and deformation of sediment sequences. This award will                
              support deployment of instrumentation in ODP holes to measure                  
              temperature, pressure and electrical conductivity, and to allow                
              sampling of borehole fluids. The ODP holes are isolated from bottom            
              waters by sealing the holes. Recovery of data and samples will be              
              done by submersible or remote techniques.
