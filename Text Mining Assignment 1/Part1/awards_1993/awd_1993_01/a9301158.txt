Abstract    :
              9301158  Gurtin       This research concerns the further development of the 
              general theory and the analysis of specific models of  nonequilibrium
              thermomechanics of multiphase continua.  The  following studies are planned: i)
              the development of a dynamical  theory of incoherent phase transitions, with
              emphasis on surface  stress; ii) the development of general theory of highly 
              nonequilibrium phase transitions driven by mass transport, with  emphasis on
              the construction of models for solute tapping; iii)  the analysis of models
              that generalize motion by curvature; these  models include crystal anisotropy
              and yield a dynamical theory of  crystal growth; iv) the analysis of general
              Stephan problems that  allow for superheating and supercooling, with emphasis
              on  nucleations.  ***
