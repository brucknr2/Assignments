Abstract    :
              9301602  Poreda    This proposal is a collaborative research effort between the
              University  of Rochester and the University of Rhode Island to use multiple 
              isotopic tracers to investigate the dynamics of outgassing when  thermally
              buoyant mantle plumes interact with the depleted  asthenosphere along the
              Mid-Atlantic Ridge (79 N -6 S). This proposal  will focus on the isotopic
              analyses of the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Xe)  and on the elemental
              parent/daughter concentrations (Rb/Sr, Sm/Nd,  U/Pb, Th/Pb and Cl). On
              hand-picked MORB glass, a complete  multi-isotope and concentration data set
              will be established for  elements of varying volatilities, ranging from Sr,
              Nd,Pb to He,Ne, Ar,  Xe and Cl. By combining both volatile and lithophile
              isotope  measurements with geophysical data, this research will attempt to 
              constrain the outgassing behavior of mantle plumes, the nature, scale  length
              and mixing characteristics of mantle heterogeneities and the  dynamics of
              plume-asthenosphere mixing. The four provinces of  investigation are: the
              Equatorial Atlantic, the Jan  Mayen-Mohns-Knipovich Ridge, the
              Iceland-Reykjanes-Kolbeinsey Ridge and  the Azores-Mid Atlantic Ridge . Each
              region has unique geochemical and  tectonic characteristics that will provide
              insights into mantle  evolution and plume dynamics.
