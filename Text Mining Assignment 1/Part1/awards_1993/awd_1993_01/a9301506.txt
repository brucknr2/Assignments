Abstract    :
                   Alspach will investigate the preduals of the space of                     
              absolutely summable sequences and their relation to the spaces of              
              continuous functions.  In particular, questions such as which of               
              these preduals are quotients of a space of continuous functions                
              with separable dual are to be considered.  Schutt will continue                
              his investigation of the floating body of a convex body and                    
              extend the investigations to random polytopes and their relation               
              to polyhedral approximation and the hyperplane problem.                        
                   Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that                      
              attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the                       
              structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The                
              axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more                    
              relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the                    
              "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a result,                
              the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.  Much of                 
              the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory               
              of Banach spaces.
