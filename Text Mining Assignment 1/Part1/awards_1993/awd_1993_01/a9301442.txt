Abstract    :
              9301442  Kachel       This project connects Jamestown College to NSFNET through 
              NorthWestNet over a 56 kbps line.  Faculty and students will  benefit from
              access to the resources of the Internet, including  libraries and
              supercomputers.  In addition, they will be able to  communicate and collaborate
              with colleagues at other institutions  in pursuit of research and educational
              projects.  The award  provides partial support of the project for two years.
