Abstract    :
              9301259  Agarwal  This project will explore several areas of computational 
              geometry, including arrangements of surfaces, ray shooting and  hidden surface
              removal, approximate algorithms, dynamic  algorithms, and multidimensional
              searching.  There will be a  special emphasis on higher dimensional problems
              and on  problems involving nonlinear objects.  Since it is not always  possible
              to obtain simple deterministic algorithms, the  project will develop and
              implement approximate and randomized  algorithms for several hard problems. 
              The impact of the  research will be two fold:  (i) discovering new mathematical
               techniques to solve various geometric problems, and (ii)  developing and
              implementing simple algorithms that work well  in practice.  ***
