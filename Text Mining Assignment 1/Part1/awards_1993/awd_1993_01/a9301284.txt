Abstract    :
              The project aims to deliver a functioning expert system to                     
              practitioners. Formalization of the knowledge base will enable                 
              expansion and modification of the system in the future. The                    
              research includes knowledge acquisition following the Delphi                   
              Method. Two decision making processes for ranking retaining wall               
              alternatives will be tested: a linear method and a multi-                      
              objective method using fuzzy set theory. The project includes                  
              overall testing, evaluation of performance, and identification of              
              methods for automatic knowledge acquisition.
