Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Larvae of sea urchins develop larger ephemeral feeding structures              
              when food is scarce and accelerate development of postlarval                   
              structures when food is abundant.  The proposed research will test             
              whether similar adaptive plasticity occurs in larval development of            
              other marine animals and can be seen in natural populations of                 
              larvae.  The research will also test the effects of endogenous food            
              supplies on larval development.//
