Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with nonlinear time series                      
              analysis.  It has four main objectives.  The first objective is                
              to develop new methods for modeling nonlinear time series  via                 
              nonparametric smoothing techniques.  This research is a                        
              continuation of the work on functional coefficient AR models and               
              nonlinear additive AR models by the PI and Tsay over the last                  
              several years.  See Chen and Tsay (1993a, 1993b). The results                  
              obtained under this research will increase the applicability of                
              nonlinear time series models.                                                  
                   The second objective of the proposed research is to                       
              investigate binary-process driven switching regression models.                 
              A unified treatment is proposed for the general switching                      
              structures and a testing procedure is introduced for                           
              discriminating a random (independent) switching regression model               
              from a Markov-chain driven model.  The third objective is to                   
              study new approaches in finding the indicator variable for an                  
              open-loop threshold AR model.  Several approaches are suggested                
              to overcome the difficulties encountered in using the open-loop                
              threshold AR models.  In particular, two algorithms and some                   
              graphical tools are proposed to identify an appropriate indicator              
              variable.  The final objective is to investigate the ergodicity                
              conditions of some nonlinear time series models.  The results                  
              obtained will provide a better understanding of the nonlinear                  
              models as well as a foundation on which asymptotic properties of               
              various nonparametric statistics for nonlinear time series                     
              analysis can be established.
