Abstract    :
              This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                    
              Program of the Chemistry Division involves an investigation of                 
              a number of aspects of the electronic structure of atoms and                   
              molecules with a focus on the structure of reduced density                     
              matrices, the extended Koopmans' theorem, and the development                  
              of analytic approximations to the electron-electron pair                       
              density.  A goal is to obtain more accurate descriptions of                    
              ionization energies and the ionization process itself.  Also                   
              being sought are improvements in the form of                                   
              exchange-correlation potentials for use in density functional                  
              theories of electronic structure.

              Descriptions of the electronic structure of atoms, molecules,                  
              and solids typically involve highly mathematical formulations                  
              which make their interpretations difficult.  In this                           
              theoretical study ways are being sought to simplify the                        
              descriptions without loss of rigor.  A particular focus of the                 
              study is the formulation of new mathematical descriptions of                   
              the important process of the removal of an electron from an                    
              atom or molecule to form a positive ion.
