Abstract    :
              A variety of x-ray diffraction studies are proposed for improving              
              our knowledge of the structures of quasicrystals.  Multiple Bragg              
              scattering will be used to measure phases of structure factors,                
              and, in particular, to address the question whether or not certain             
              quasicrystals have a center of inversion.  It is proposed to                   
              measure intensity of Bragg reflection using synchrotron high energy            
              x-rays, in order to circumvent the extinction and the absorption               
              problems.  Absolute measurements will be performed by measuring                
              Compton scattering.  The possibility for dynamical diffraction                 
              effects in quasicrystals will be explored.  Standing waves                     
              experiments are proposed for the purpose of gaining some knowledge             
              about the reciprocal positions in real space of the various atomic             
              planes.  The general purpose of the proposed research is to provide            
              experimental information useful for a determination of the atomic              
              sites in Al-Cu-Fe and Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystals.                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Quasicrystals are metallic alloys that have many properties in                 
              common with ordinary crystals, yet their symmetry properties are               
              not compatible with the laws of crystallography.  The goal of this             
              proposal is to determine the locations of the atomic sites.                    
              Besides their interest from the point of view of basic science,                
              their exceptional resistance to oxidation, high temperature and                
              alkaline corrosion makes then interesting as new materials.
