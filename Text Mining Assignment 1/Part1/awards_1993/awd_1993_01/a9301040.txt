Abstract    :
                   This grant supports work by Professor Shahidi in the theory of            
              automorphic forms and representation theory.  The investigator will            
              study the non-discrete tempered spetrum of classical groups over               
              local fields by means of the theory of endoscopy as developed by               
              Kottwitz, Langlands and Shelstad.                                              
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
