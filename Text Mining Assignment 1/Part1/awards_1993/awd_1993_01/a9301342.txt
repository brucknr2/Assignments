Abstract    :
              9301342  Steele  This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science award will support the
              collaboration of William   Steele of Pennsylvania State University and Eduardo
              Bottani of the Instituto de   Investigaciones Fisicoquimicas Theoricas y
              Aplicadas in La Plata, Argentina, and   Giorgio Zgrablich of the University of
              San Luis in Argentina.  The project aims to   investigate physical adsorption
              on heterogeneous surfaces.    Computer simulations provide detailed information
              which facilitates the testing and   improvement of theoretical studies of
              complex systems, such as the adsorption and   diffusion of interacting
              molecules on heterogeneous substrates.  In this project, the   researchers will
              select both theoretical and simulation projects that will yield results  
              relevant to each other and to experiment.  Models for theoretical study will be
              clearly   related to those used in simulations; conversely, models used in
              simulations will be   relevant to theory.  The U.S. group will conduct computer
              simulations of the   thermodynamic, structural, and dynamical properties of
              simple gases adsorbed on   realistic model heterogeneous solids.  The Argentine
              group will develop theoretical and   experimental treatments for related
              systems.  Both sides will benefit from the opportunity   to make quantitative
              comparisons between the two sets of results.  ***
