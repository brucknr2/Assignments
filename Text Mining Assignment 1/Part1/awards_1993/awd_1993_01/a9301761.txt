Abstract    :
              9301761  Ritter    The role of moisture in enhancing delamination of model
              polymer-  bonded systems is studied experimentally and analytically.  Model 
              systems in which the crack driving force and the loading are  variable are
              tested in differing moisture environments.  A range of  important adhesives and
              techniques for modifying the adhesive  bonding on interfaces are examined.  A
              subclass of adhesives that  delaminate by finger-like growth on the interface
              are included in  the studies.  Adhesive properties, treatment of the interface,
               thickness of the adhesive layer, and moisture environment are  variables under
              study.  Finite element techniques are employed to  model the systems, which can
              have multiple cracks and different  crack growth rates.  Crack shielding in
              multiple crack systems and  the role of focussed crack process zones in thin
              layers of  adhesives are considered.  %%%  Understanding and minimizing the
              effect of moisture on the bonding  characteristics of these systems is of
              obvious importance to the  application of polymer adhesives.    ***
