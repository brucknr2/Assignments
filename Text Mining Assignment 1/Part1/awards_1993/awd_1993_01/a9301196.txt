Abstract    :
              9301196  Bar-on       In robust control a collection of perturbations with a
              given  structure can be viewed as a differentiable manifold with a  nontrivial
              topology.  This manifold can be divided into regions  of stability and
              instability, where the identity matrix is a  point in the region of stability
              and represents the unperturbed  system.  A stability margin for such a
              collection of structured  perturbations can be defined as the smallest 
              "distance" on the  manifold from the identity matrix to the region of
              instability.   Bar-on and Jonckheere have defined the multivariable phase
              margin  by restricting the class of perturbations to the group of unitary 
              matrices.  It has been shown for the two-dimensional case that,  when viewed
              geometrically, the phase margin can be represented as  the minimum arc length
              on the three sphere from the north pole to  the region of instability.  The
              proposed research centers on  generalizing these properties to the
              n-dimensional case with  special focus on: (1) the geometric and topological
              properties of  the phase margin; (2) the division of the manifold of unitary 
              perturbations into stabilizing and destabilizing regions; and (3)  the design
              of compensators to improve the phase margin.  The main  goal of this research
              is to develop a thorough understanding of  the phase margin and to relate these
              abstract concepts back to  engineering issues in robust control theory and
              design.   ***
