Abstract    :
              The phase II Research Project will encompass a series of imagine  tests at 248nm
              with the catadioptric lens, using thin coatings of  deep-UV resists to obtain
              maximum resolution.  We will then  fabricate a 193nm version of the lens and
              test it with the same  criteria used at 248nm.  In parallel with this task we
              will  fabricate a step-and-repeat imagine platform and integrate a 3-  motion
              (x,y,z) state system, viewing optics, CRT monitor, lens and  delivery optics.  
               Prior to running tests with the imagine platform, we will test two  different
              homogenizer designs, selecting the best one for final  tests.  We will also run
              an optics damage threshold test on the  critical optical surfaces to determine
              the maximum energy we can  deliver through the system to the wafer substrates. 
              Finally, the  integration of the delivery optics with the selected homogenizer 
              will take place, completing the imaging platform; we will mount the  operator
              viewing optics above the x, y, and z stages, connect a CRT  monitor and run a
              series of 193nm maximum resolution and maximum  energy tests.  The most
              advanced deep-UV resists will be used for  samples, and data taken on field
              resolution, field uniformity, and  energy transmission efficiency of the
              complete optical train.  Data  will be generated on both the lithographic
              properties of the entire  system, as well as the capabilities for photoablation
              reactions.   This data will identify the potential of the technology for 
              commercial applications.  ***
