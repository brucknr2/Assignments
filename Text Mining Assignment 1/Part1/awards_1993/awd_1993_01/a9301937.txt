Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal involves the study of atmospheric airglow and               
              noctilucent clouds (ANLCs) with a wide field imager from the NCAR              
              Electra aircraft for the ALOHA/ANLC-93 campaign.  The imager will              
              provide correlative data to the campaign which includes lidar,                 
              radar, and spectroscopic information from the Upper Mesosphere-                
              Lower Thermosphere region.  The basic campaign objectives are to               
              locate and study the geophysical conditions associated with ANLCs,             
              gravity wave dynamics, and sporadic Na layers.  In addition to                 
              providing an observational contribution to these team goals, a                 
              specific study of the horizontal attributes of gravity waves                   
              resolved from these data will be performed and compared to an                  
              existing data set which was taken over a 7 month period in 1991-92             
              at Bear Lake, UT with the same instrument that is proposed here.               
                                                                                             
                   Lockheed has developed and successfully demonstrated in                   
              several ground based campaigns, a sensitive, bare CCD imager                   
              capable of measuring OH, O2, Na, and OI nightglows with high signal            
              to noise ratios.  In particular, OH imaging using broad band                   
              techniques (7500-9300 ), have produced >50:1 S:N with 60 s                    
              exposures using .35o pixels (.5 km resolution overhead) with all-             
              sky optics.  With this sensitivity, airglow intensity amplitudes on            
              the order of a few percent have been observed.  The array is a 1024            
              X 1024 (15.4mm X 15.4mm) which is 4x larger than the commercially             
              available arrays used in aeronomical studies to date.  The system              
              uses commercial electronics (including a computer) which are rugged            
              and stable for the aircraft environment.  Coordination has been                
              made with NCAR to install an all-sky dome on the aircraft to                   
              accommodate the all-sky field.  Aircraft pitch and roll stability              
              have been investigated to suggest that, for typical flight                     
              conditions, angular resolutions of .5o over 30 seconds can be                 
              achieved.                                                                      
                                                                                             
                   The wide field camera will be used to (1) document                        
              irregularities in the OH airglow layer which are caused by                     
              atmospheric gravity waves and tides affecting the layer for flight             
              segments where the Solar Elevation Angle (SEA)<-10o (which is the              
              condition for most flight paths for the campaign); (2) image solar             
              scattered illumination of noctilucent clouds where -6o<SEA<-8o for             
              the ANLC phase; and (3) image the Na 'sodium flash' at SEA-6.5o in            
              support of the study of sporadic Na layers.  Observations (2) and              
              (3) are feasible on the two planned flights north into the polar               
              cap.                                                                           
                                                                                             
                   With the OH imagery, the horizontal wavelength, intensity                 
              amplitude, apparent horizontal phase velocity, and spatial extent              
              (up to 500 km radius of the aircraft), will be studied in objective            
              (1).  Spectral density analysis will be performed on imagery to                
              resolve the horizontal gravity wave information.  In the ANLC                  
              campaign,m observations of the clouds will be attempted to provide             
              information of ANLC's location.  From Na 'flash' imagery, the Na               
              density will be inverted from the image.  For a very specific                  
              location (i.e. SEA-6.5o) the Na column density will be derived from           
              the image for an assumed constant solar illumination of the layer.
