Abstract    :
              9301964  Wagner  Deflection routing is an important routing paradigm in opto- 
              electronic interconnection networks.  This project applies the  technique of
              Mean Value Analysis to the problem of analyzing such  networks.  Other
              stochastic models of deflection routing  typically restrict attention to a
              single switch, which precludes  consideration of non-uniform traffic patterns,
              or they assume  that external arrivals that cannot be admitted to the network 
              immediately are dropped.  The MVA technique has no such  limitations, and
              furthermore it allows modeling of the network in  its entirety, including
              processors and/or memories that are  attached to the network.    Preliminary
              investigation of this approach by the PI has shown  much promise.  The
              principal goals of this project are to (a)  improve the efficiency and accuracy
              of the technique, and (b) use  this technique to explore the design space of
              switch and network  architectures for deflection-routed networks.  ***
