Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Voloch to work              
              in the theory of Diophantine equations.  The study of Diophantine              
              equations, that is, the search for solutions in integers or                    
              rational numbers of polynomial equations, is a very classical topic            
              in number theory.  Much of the recent progress in the subject stems            
              from insights obtained from the analogous problem when rational                
              numbers are replaced by rational functions, the so-called function             
              field case.  This project will study this last case.  Previous work            
              of the author has led to general results of a qualitative nature.              
              It is hoped in this project to obtain quantitative results, leading            
              to effective bounds that allow one to actually find the solutions              
              to the equations.                                                              
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number theory            
              starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                        
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
