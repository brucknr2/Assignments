Abstract    :
              9301875  Zumberge             The Scripps Institution of Oceanography will
              undertake an ocean  sciences instrumentation development project to design and 
              construct an instrument for measuring strain accumulation at  seafloor
              spreading centers.  The instrument will use fiber optic  technology to provide
              long-term measurements of horizontal seafloor  strain with accuracies of 1-2
              millimeters.  The measurements will  provide information on the nature and
              speed of seafloor spreading  associated with plate tectonics.  Seafloor strain
              is one of several  measurements selected for inclusion in a long-term seafloor 
              observatory planned for the RIDGE initiative.  The instrument will  use an
              optical fiber over a path-length of up to 1 kilometer and a  commercially
              available electronic distance meter that has been  adapted for use at sea.  The
              instrument will provide very precise  measurements over periods of up to one
              year.  Millimeter precision  of seafloor movement will provide new scientific
              insights for  geophysical research.    ***
