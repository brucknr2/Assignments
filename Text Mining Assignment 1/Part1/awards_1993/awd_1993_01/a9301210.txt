Abstract    :
              9301210  Lynch       This award will support the collaborative effort between 
              computer scientists Lynch, Rice, and Marinescu and biologist  Rossman.  The
              principal research issues to be addressed are:  1)  The analysis of biological
              macromolecular structures, with  emphasis on viruses, virus-receptor and
              virus-antibody complexes;   the study of new antiviral compounds that interact
              with viral  capsids, interfere with viral-receptor interaction, or inhibit 
              uncoating.  2)  The development and analysis of parallel  algorithms for film
              and imaging plate processing, phase  determination by molecular replacement,
              refinement and structure  analysis in the study of biological macromolecular
              molecules or  assemblies such as viruses.  ***
