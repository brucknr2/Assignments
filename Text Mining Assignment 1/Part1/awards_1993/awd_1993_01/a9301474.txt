Abstract    :
              Dr. Jeffery G. Saven has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Saven's doctoral degree was from                  
              Columbia University under the supervision of Professor James                   
              Skinner.  Dr. Saven will continue research at the University of                
              Illinois under the sponsorship of Professor Peter Wolynes. Dr.                 
              Saven's postdoctoral training will deal with the theory of                     
              glasses and the quantum mechanical simulation of proteins.                     
              Longer term, he plans to develop theoretical models for                        
              transitions between conformational substates of proteins which                 
              will simulate hole burning spectroscopy experiments.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
