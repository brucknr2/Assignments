Abstract    :
                   In 1993, Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Geological                   
              Observatory will operate the research vessel MAURICE EWING in                  
              support of NSF-funded scientific research.  The EWING is a 230'                
              general purpose research vessel with specialized capability in                 
              marine geology and geophysics.  Although the vessel operates world             
              wide, cruises in 1993 will only be in the Atlantic Ocean.                      
              Following a lay-up in early 1993 the EWING will support six                    
              projects from the North Atlantic and ultimately south to the Vema              
              Fracture Zone in the South Atlantic.                                           
                   This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science               
              Foundation in support of oceanographic research.  Most                         
              oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment and                
              extensive support from the ship's crew members.  Increasingly                  
              research projects require equipment which must be permanently                  
              installed on the vessel, thus requiring specialized vessels.  These            
              vessels do not operate the same as general cargo/fishing vessels,              
              therefore NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels                   
              specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated             
              by universities and research institutes around the country.
