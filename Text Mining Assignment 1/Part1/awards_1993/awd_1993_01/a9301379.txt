Abstract    :
              9301379  Duraiswami    This Phase II SBIR project aims to design, build, and
              test a PC-based devise for measuring and processing data related to sound
              propagation in bubbly liquids.  Applicaitons include ocean-atmospheric studies
              of the balance of greenhouse gases, oxygenation of oceans and its role in the
              food chain, technologies to mask propeller noise in naval operations, and
              ultrasonic diagnostic tools in bioengineering.  ***
