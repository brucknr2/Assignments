Abstract    :
              The prime objective of the research is to develop a system                     
              of computational models for response analysis of actual                        
              heterogeneous materials.  In these materials, microscopic                      
              particulates or fibers (in reinforced composites) or precipitates              
              and pores, (in alloy systems) of arbitrary shapes and sizes, are               
              randomly dispersed in the matrix.  The intended research is based              
              upon a vigorous collaboration between university and industry.  The            
              research will blend voronoi cell elements, homogenization method               
              and extend them, to innovate a novel and sophisticated system of               
              computational modules, that will accurately depict the complex                 
              deformation mechanisms and material evolution in actual multi phase            
              materials.
