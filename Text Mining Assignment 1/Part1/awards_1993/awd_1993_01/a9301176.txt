Abstract    :
              Williams will continue his investigation of the ideal structure of crossed 
              product C*-algebras.  The primary focus will be on the interplay between 
              topological invariants associated to a dynamical system and the structure of
              the  resulting crossed product.  This project involves research in ergodic
              theory.  Ergodic theory in general  concerns understanding the average behavior
              of systems whose dynamics is too  complicated or chaotic to be followed in
              microscopic detail.  Under the heading  "dynamics" can be placed the modern
              theory of how groups of abstract  transformations act on smooth spaces.  In
              this way, ergodic theory makes contact  with geometry in its quest to classify
              flows on homogeneous spaces.
