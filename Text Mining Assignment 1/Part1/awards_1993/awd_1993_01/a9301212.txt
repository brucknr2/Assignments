Abstract    :
                   As one of the major activities of the Cornelius Lanczos                   
              International Centenary Celebration at North Carolina State                    
              University, the University will hold an international conference               
              (December 12-17, 1993) on computational mathematics, theoretical               
              physics, and astrophysics.  The conference will reflect the wide               
              scope of interests of Lanczos and will offer a unique opportunity              
              for interaction among numerical analysts, theoretical physicists               
              and astrophysicists.  The conference will bring together                       
              scientists in the communities of applied and computational                     
              mathematic, theoretical physics and astrophysics for a focused                 
              exchange of ideas: to share problems, perspectives and                         
              experiences in an attempt to make progress on some of the                      
              central, unsolved problems in physical science.  The conference                
              will also expose students in mathematics and physics to the                    
              interdisciplinary methodologies and tools of science.  The                     
              organizing committee will invite participation by students and                 
              will especially encourage recent doctoral recipients, women,                   
              minorities and persons with disabilities to participate.  The                  
              total funding from the NSF will be used to provide partial travel              
              support of these participants.
