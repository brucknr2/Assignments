Abstract    :
              9301058  Detrick  The above-referenced project comprises a seismic
              refraction/wide  angle reflection survey in the vicinity of Hole 504B in the
              eastern  Pacific.  One of the priorities of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) 
              is to increase knowledge of ocean crustal structure.  Core  materials and logs
              from Hole 504B provide a "reference section" for  the composition and structure
              of the upper oceanic crust.   ODP  drilling has deepened this hole to over two
              km sub-seafloor depth,  in the process documenting the transition between upper
              extrusive  and lower intrusive basalts, as predicted by studies of on-land 
              ophiolite exposures, and ocean seismic refraction and reflection  data.  The
              hole currently bottoms in sheeted dikes.  The OBS  seismic refraction/wide
              angle reflection experiment will target the  transition between seismic layers
              2 and 3.  This work would aim at  resolving the discrepancy between ocean
              crustal seismic and  petrologic knowledge, and will help tie data from the 504B
               "reference section", ophiolite exposures, and marine seismic  refraction and
              reflection data.  ***
