Abstract    :
              9301522  Avignone  This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science award will support
              travel  and related expenses for collaboration by Frank Avignone of the 
              University of South Carolina and Daniel Di Gregorio of the TANDAR  nuclear
              laboratory in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The project aims  to install a
              detector, shielding, and data acquisition system for  exploring cold dark
              matter in the universe.    According to recent research, the effects of elastic
              scattering  of cold dark matter candidate particles in the Earth imply that 
              repeating existing searches at southern latitudes would render  them far more
              sensitive.  Also, for a significant range of cold  dark matter mass and
              coupling strength, data from detectors  sensitive to cold dark matter by
              nuclear recoil from elastic  scattering will have observable diurnal
              modulations.  This award  will support two senior investigators, one recent
              doctoral  recipient, and one graduate student on the U.S. side to  participate
              in installing and obtaining data from a cold dark  matter detector facility in
              southern Argentina.  Both sides will  benefit from training of junior
              investigators, access to  fundamental research data in the Southern Hemisphere,
              and  exchange of technologies.  ***
