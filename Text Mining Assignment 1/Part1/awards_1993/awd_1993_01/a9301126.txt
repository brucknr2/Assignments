Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The conference for which funds are requested is sponsored by the               
              American Society for Microbiology and is titled "Multicellular and             
              Interactive Behavior of Bacteria". The traditional paradigm of                 
              bacteria is that they are essentially single-celled organisms that             
              do not interact with each other in any systematic way. Gradually,              
              however, it is coming to be realized that bacteria, like most other            
              living cells interact with each other as well as with other types              
              of cells, both animal and plant. These interactions are manifested             
              by their ability to mate with each other and to exchange signals               
              prior to doing so, to collaborate in their metabolic processes, to             
              form biofilms on a variety of surfaces, to undergo complex                     
              developmental processes, to engage in cooperative movements and to             
              coordinate their pathogenic activities with each other. It has                 
              become clear that these cell-cell interactions often allow bacteria            
              to carry out biotransformations that are not possible otherwise.               
              The conference will bring together investigators working on these              
              various aspects of bacterial multicellularity and offer the                    
              opportunity for the exchange of ideas and information. It is the               
              hope of the organizers of the conference that it will facilitate               
              the introduction of this new paradigm into the field of prokaryotic            
              biology.
