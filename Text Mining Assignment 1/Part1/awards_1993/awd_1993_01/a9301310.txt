Abstract    :
                   Intelligent, dynamic scheduling in manufacturing systems                  
              encompasses a unique set of problems which span Computer Science,              
              Engineering, and Cognitive Science fields of expertise.  Many                  
              issues come to play in the manufacturing scheduling arena,                     
              including:  1.  external (suppliers, production orders, market                 
              conditions, etc.) and internal factors (machine layout, setup                  
              times, maintenance, etc.),  2.  interactions within the plant                  
              because of, e.g., resource sharing among lines or cells,  3.                   
              unexpected conditions or events (breakdowns, stockouts, strikes,               
              etc.),  4. inventory policies (e.g., MRP versus JIT),  5.  type of             
              layout (e.g. flow lines, cells, job shop),  6.  volume.  These and             
              other issues render the scheduling problem a complicated one,                  
              requiring a knowledge-rich solution procedure based on a model of              
              the plant synthesis-type reasoning tasks.                                      
                   This workshop brings together researchers with the unique                 
              blend of skill necessary to develop models and schedulers in                   
              manufacturing.  The goals of the workshop are to:  1.  clarify what            
              progress has been made in this area,  2.  identify the various                 
              levels and types of schedules required in manufacturing and how                
              they interact,  3.  identify the factors most critical to schedule             
              formation/revision,  4.  address plant-specific research versus                
              more general research via a discussion of classification or                    
              morphology of plant types and/or features,  5.  compare                        
              manufacturing scheduling to other types of scheduling tasks; what              
              makes manufacturing scheduling unique?,  6.  discuss empirical                 
              versus theoretical research in the field,  7.  set major research              
              goals for future work.//
