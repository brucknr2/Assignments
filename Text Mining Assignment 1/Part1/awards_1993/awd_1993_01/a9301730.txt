Abstract    :
              9301730  Gieskes  The objectives of this research project (a renewal) include
              work on  (1) design, construction, and testing of an ocean borehole-fluid 
              water sampler that could be deployed using wireline borehole  reentry
              techniques, (2) sampling of selected ocean boreholes using  opportunities
              provided by French NADIA/NAUTILE reentry facility  activities near selected
              Deep Sea Drilling Project/Ocean Drilling  Program boreholes in 1993-1994, (3)
              water sampling at holes of  opportunity, to be collected from the JOIDES
              Resolution during  ocean drilling legs during 1993-1994, and (4) laboratory 
              experimentation and modelling of water-rock geochemistry at varying 
              temperatures and pressures.  Sampling and chemical analysis of  ocean borehole
              fluids will provide insights to the nature of  seawater - borehole wall rock
              chemical reactions, and should help  answer fundamental questions about the
              role that formation fluids  may play in seawater-borehole interactions. 
              Together with  modelling efforts, these observations will also ultimately be of
               importance in understanding hydrothermal reactions in high-  temperature ocean
              boreholes.  ***
