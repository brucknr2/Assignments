Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase II award is for further research on a method                   
              to evaluate blood flow in capillary beds using Doppler                         
              ultrasound and a contrast media.  The Phase I research                         
              verified the presence of flows in the capillary beds and                       
              that relative changes in flow could be detected.  The Phase                    
              II research will focus on theoretical and experimental                         
              analyses of flow and perfusion and the construction of a                       
              laboratory prototype.  In addition, a method to determine                      
              perfusion without the need for the contrast agent will be                      
              explored.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The technique to make noninvasive measurements of                              
              microcirculatory blood flow should have extensive commercial                   
              potential in the medical imaging field for measuring                           
              myocardial infarct, vessel occlusion, tissue perfusion, etc.                   
              In addition, the device should have applications in the                        
              fields of chemical and materials engineering and                               
              manufacturing.
