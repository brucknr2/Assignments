Abstract    :
              9301024  Horwitz  A new time dependent, semi-kinetic approach for treating core
              or  thermal plasma evolution on L = 4 - 7 flux tubes, has been recently 
              developed.  This approach is self-consistent, allows direct  calculation of the
              ion distribution functions, incorporates such  large-scale ion kinetic effects
              as velocity dispersion, stream-  stream interpenetration, and small-angle
              Coulomb collisions, and  flexibly permits incorporation of plasma
              microprocesses such as  wave-particle interactions.  The L = 4 - 7 region is a
              basic  starting point for understanding many aspects of magnetosphere- 
              ionosphere coupling.  The proposed study is on the self-consistent  development
              and effects on the evolving core plasma of: large-scale  electrostatic
              potential distributions, hot plasma driven heating,  ionosphere/transition
              region source, and multi-ion dynamics.   Current model enhancements planned are
              (1) a generalized fluid  treatment with a quasi-kinetic treatment of
              low-density  suprathermal populations; (2) iclude a realistic ionospheric and 
              collisional-collisionless transition region model; and (3)  incorporate hot
              (ring current) plasma distributions and self-  consistent calculation of their
              effects on the electrostatic  potential, and energy and pitch angle diffusion
              of inflowing  ionospheric plasma through Coulomb collisions and wave-particle 
              interactions.  Dynamics Explorer-1 data will be compared on L = 4.6  shells
              with our model predictions.  ***
