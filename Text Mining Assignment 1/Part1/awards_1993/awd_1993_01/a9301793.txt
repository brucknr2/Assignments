Abstract    :
              BLAIR  9301793    This project is aimed at defining the transport and
              decomposition  of newly deposited algal carbon in the seabed. A multi-tracer 
              mixture (13C-Algae, clay, glass beads) will be spread on the  seafloor at two
              North Carolina continental slope sites that are  characterized by different
              infaunal densities to determine the  impact of animal populations on particle
              mixing and organic carbon  turnover.  The 13C will be followed through various
              reservoirs  (e.g., solid phase organic and inorganic carbon, dissolved 
              inorganic carbon, animal tissues) on time scales ranging from days  to one
              year.  Apparent rate constants for the degradation of  specific algal
              biochemicals will be determined.  Identification of  diagenetic products
              resulting from the turnover of the algal carbon  by the benthic ecosystem will
              be investigated and related to the  naturally occurring profiles of 234Th and
              210Pb. Potential  selectivity by deposit feeders for organic content, particle
              size  and quality of material ingested will be evaluated.  Uptake of 13C- 
              algal material by infauna will be studied to determine the relative  importance
              of different feeding modes, distributions within the  sediment column and body
              sizes.
