Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Duke University will operate the R/V CAPE HATTERAS during 1993            
              as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-sponsored                  
              research projects.  The HATTERAS is a 135' general purpose research            
              vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by                
              Duke University.  The vessel is scheduled in 1993 for a total of               
              216 days, of which 193 are in support of NSF-sponsored projects.               
              The remaining 23 days are in support of ONR, DOE and the State of              
              N. Carolina projects.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   The Hatteras will operate out of Bermuda the first four months            
              of 1993. The vessel will take over the work normally performed by              
              WEATHERBIRD II while it is undergoing a four month upgrade and                 
              conversion. The rest of the year the HATTERAS will operate out of              
              its home port, Beaufort, where work will be done along the shelf               
              and slope regions of the Carolinas and Virginia. The ship will                 
              support a mixture of biology, seismic and coring and geochemistry.             
              The schedule for the end of the year is light. This  period will be            
              used to continue maintenance and upgrade.
