                    9301992 Rao This work aims at developing a fuzzy finite element for the
              analysis of imprecisely defined systems.  The development of the present
              methodology starts from the basic concepts of fuzzy numbers and fuzzy
              arithmetic and implements suitably defined fuzzy calculus concepts such as
              differentiation and integration for the derivation, manipulation and solution
              of the finite element equations.  The approach is applicable to all types of
              analyses including stress analysis , fluid flow and heat transfer. 
              Representative stress analysis problems involving vaguely defined geometry,
              material properties, external loads and boundary conditions will be solved to
              establish and illustrate the new procedure.  Simple experiments will be
              conducted to verify some of the results predicted by the fuzzy methodology. 
              The approach developed will be applicable  to systems which are described in
              linguistic terms as well as those that are described by incomplete information.
