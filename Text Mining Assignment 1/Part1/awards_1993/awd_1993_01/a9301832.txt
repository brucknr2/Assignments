Abstract    :
                   Direct measurement of solar plasma electric fields has                    
              received relatively little attention considering the central                   
              importance of such fields in energy release, and in plasma and                 
              energetic particle acceleration in the solar atmosphere.  This                 
              project's aim is to carry out ground-based measurements of such                
              fields to validate the promising "electrograph" technique of                   
              electric field remote sensing based on measurement of the                      
              transverse Stark effect in solar hydrogen lines.  Present work so              
              far has centered on development and operation of a Mk I                        
              electrography at the NSO Evans Facility at Sacramento Peak, using              
              the high Balmer and Paschen series lines.  We are presently                    
              upgrading the SPO instrument to increase its sensitivity to 1 volt             
              cm-1.  This project will carry out two specific observational tests            
              of this sensitivity, and to operate it on a daily basis to with                
              flares, eruptive filaments, sunspots and faculae.  The project will            
              also requests support to extend this technique farther into the                
              infrared, to include promising hydrogen lines out to beyond 10.               
              Some of this IR work is getting underway in late 1992, using the               
              newly installed IR grating in the main McMath spectrograph at Kitt             
              Peak, and the new NSO IR array.  The results of these                          
              investigations will be compared to the discharge and reconnection              
              models of flares, to models of post-flare loops, filament                      
              eruptions, and also to recent ideas on solar abundance variations.
