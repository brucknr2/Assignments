Abstract    :
                   The Missouri Research and Education Network (MOREnet) is                  
              establishing a connection to NSFNET via a  56,000 bits per second              
              line for two community colleges and a community college district               
              comprising three campuses.  The institutions are Mineral Area                  
              College, St. Charles County Community College, and the Metropolitan            
              Community College District.  The connection enables the faculties              
              and students to communicate and collaborate with the international             
              scientific and educational community, and to access network                    
              resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers.  This               
              award funds part of the costs for two years.
