Abstract    :
              9301093  Roy    This is a Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER)  project.
               The major thrust of this proposed work is to  combine the hydrothermal
              synthesis method with the microwave  radiation processing in order to produce
              ceramic powders.  Preliminary work showed that the combined processing 
              conditions could reduce the processing reaction time by  several orders of
              magnitude, as in the cases of hematite,  barium titanate, and rutile.  The
              proposed work intended to  extend this method to synthesize other ceramic
              powders.    %%%    This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project 
              plans to combine the method of hydrothermal synthesis with  the microwave
              radiation processing in order to produce  submicrometer sized ceramic powders. 
              Preliminary work  showed promise.  If successful, this new processing method 
              can drastically reduce the ceramic powder preparation time  by several orders
              of magnitude.  Shorter reaction time  always means less time and possibilities
              for contaminations.  ***
