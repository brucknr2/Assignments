Abstract    :
                      9301580  Arora  In this project, a research program is outlined to
              develop  computational methods for design sensitivity analysis and 
              optimization of complex nonlinear structural problems.  In the  first line of
              the investigation, computational methods for design  sensitivity analysis of
              response-dependent functionals will be  developed.  Transient dynamic problems
              will be treated.      A second line of investigation involving instability of
              structural  systems is also planned.  Some work has been recently done on this 
              problem; however substantial more effort is needed to fully develop  the
              numerical methods for this problem.  Theory of design  sensitivity analysis of
              the buckling load needs to be developed  with different types of material
              models.  Simultaneous occurring of  multiple buckling modes needs to be
              investigated.
