Abstract    :
              9301835  D'Asaro    New ideas on the dynamics of the oceanic mixed layer will be
              tested  using Lagrangian floats to follow turbulent eddies and acoustic  remote
              sensing to quantify the bubble field.  In addition to these  field
              observations, a series of numerical simulations will be  conducted with a
              three-dimensional model driven by the observed  wind stress, surface fluxes and
              wave field.  The ultimate goal of  this research is to identify the simplest
              physics that can reliably  reproduce the observations and be incorporated in a
              mixed layer  model.
