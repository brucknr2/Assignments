Abstract    :
              9301102  Vitek  This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will 
              support the collaboration of  Vaclav Vitek of the University of  Pennsylvania
              and Ana Maria Monti and Roberto Pasianot of the  National Atomic Energy
              Commission (CNEA) in Buenos Aires,  Argentina.  The project aims to conduct
              atomistic studies of  grain boundaries and interphases and interaction of these
               interfaces with point defects.    The researchers will carry out calculations
              for model hcp, bcc,  and hcp/bcc systems using empirical many-body potentials
              of the  EAM type.  The construction of these potentials is an integral  part of
              the proposed research.  The principal goal is to analyze  differences between
              grain and interphase boundaries, particularly  with respect to the atomic
              transport in these interfaces.  The  interphases studied will be chosen so that
              they emulate as  closely as possible the interphases in Zr/Zr-Nb systems which 
              have been extensively studied at CNEA.  The Argentine group will  conduct the
              computer simulations and develop or select of the  interatomic potentials.  The
              U.S. side will provide the computer  codes for the atomistic modelling of grain
              boundaries and the  graphical programs necessary to interpret atomistic
              calculations.   Both sides will benefit from collaboration on the
              interpretation  and analysis of data, encompassing the construction of 
              interatomic potentials and their testing and the computer  modeling of
              interfaces.  ***
