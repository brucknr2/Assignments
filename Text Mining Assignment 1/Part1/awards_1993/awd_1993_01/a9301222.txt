Abstract    :
              9301222  Allen  Epitaxial semi-metal/semiconductor heterostructures have the
              potential to add new dimensions to semiconductor electronics by providing
              buried interconnects or ground planes or enabling control of quantum transport
              in resonant tunneling structures and hot electron transistors.    Using the
              unique properties of the Rare-earth monarsenide/GaAs system we propose
              investigating quantum transport through ultra-thin buried semi-metal layers in
              compound semiconductors in "transistor like" test structures.    The P.I.
              propose to i) determine the role of quantum confinement in semi-metal quantum
              wells, ii) measure electron transmission, reflection and loss in semi-metal
              quantum wells and iii) assess the potential of this material system for
              resonant tunneling and hot electron transistors.  ***
