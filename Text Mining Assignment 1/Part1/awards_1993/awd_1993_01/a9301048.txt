Abstract    :
                   This project involves several topics in optimal stochastic                
              control and nonlinear estimation. The main topic is risk                       
              sensitive optimal control. Risk sensitive optimal control                      
              provides a link between stochastic and deterministic (robust                   
              control) approaches to modelling disturbances in control systems.              
              Two player, zero-sum differential games arise naturally in the                 
              analysis. Risk sensitive control also involves large deviations                
              theory for stochastic processes. The methods to be utilized                    
              include viscosity solution techniques for nonlinear partial                    
              differential equations. Other classes of stochastic control                    
              problems suggested by application in finance theory will be                    
              studied. In nonlinear estimation, some problems of partially                   
              observed random fields arising in image analysis applications,                 
              and hidden Markov models, will be investigated.                                
                   One of the main issues in mathematical control theory and in              
              control applications is the design of control strategies which                 
              are insensitive to unfavorable disturbances which may occur                    
              within the control system. For plants which can be modelled as                 
              linear control systems, there are several effective strategies                 
              for obtaining good system performance in the presence of system                
              perturbations and a clear understanding of the connections                     
              between the main methods. However many, if not most, practical                 
              control systems, such as those required on high performance                    
              aircraft, are only poorly, or not at all, modelled as linear                   
              control systems. This project seeks to develop methodologies and               
              their interconnections for robust control of nonlinear stochastic              
              control systems analogous to those for linear stochastic control               
              systems.
