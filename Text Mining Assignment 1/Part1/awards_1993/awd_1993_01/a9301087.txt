Abstract    :
              This is an interagency agreement between the Department of                     
              Education (National Center for Education Statistics) and the                   
              National Science Foundation for the study of issues relating to                
              minority students' achievement in science and mathematics.  Its                
              primary purpose is to examine the current status of achievement                
              among minorities and to identify various student, home, and school             
              factors that help students learn science and mathematics.  Both                
              descriptive and higher-level statistical analysis strategies will              
              be used, depending on the nature of issues to be addressed.                    
              Results of analysis will be summarized and discussed in a report               
              prepared for dissemination to the general public.  Results of this             
              study will provide an informed basis for developing programs and               
              improving educational practices for minorities.
