Abstract    :
                        9301458  WALKER  Vegetation is a key element in understanding and
              predicting  how the Arctic region will respond to and contribute to  global
              change.  This award provides partial support for a  workshop in St. Petersburg,
              Russia to begin development of  an accurate vegetation map of the circumpolar
              arctic.  The  workshop is also being supported by the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife
              Service.  ****
