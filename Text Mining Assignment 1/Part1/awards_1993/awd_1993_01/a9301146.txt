Abstract    :
              Dr. Thea C. Norman has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                    
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Norman's doctoral degree was from                 
              the University of California/Berkeley under the supervision of                 
              Professor Clayton Heathcock. Dr. Norman will continue research                 
              at the University of California/Berkeley under the sponsorship                 
              of Professor Peter Schultz. Dr. Norman's postdoctoral research                 
              will provide her with the solid state and monoclonal antibody                  
              techniques necessary to prepare synthetic biopolymers. Longer                  
              term she plans to develop new biopolymers whose backbones are                  
              optimized for therapeutic applications including membrane                      
              permeability and biostability.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
