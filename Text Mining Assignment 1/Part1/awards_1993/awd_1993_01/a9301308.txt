Abstract    :
                   This award supports work on groups, algorithms and                        
              geometries.  Probabilistic and asymptotic properties of finite                 
              groups will be studied: the nature of random elements, or of                   
              random subgroups, of a given permutation group.  Some results                  
              obtained will be applied to algorithmic questions concerning                   
              permutation groups.  The study of polynomial-time and parallel                 
              (complexity class NC) group-theoretic algorithms will be                       
              continued.  Additional new practical group-theoretic algorithms                
              will be obtained, in some cases based on methods developed in                  
              polynomial-time situations.  All of this work will make detailed               
              use of the classification and properties of finite groups.  Some               
              of these algorithms depend on geometric methods.  Other geometric              
              projects will be continued including investigations into the                   
              number of planes, designs, generalized quadrangles, or other                   
              geometries, based upon special properties of their automorphism                
              groups.                                                                        
                   This project is in the general area of finite group theory                
              and the computer-aided computational aspects of this field.                    
              There is a growing interest in using computers to answer                       
              theoretical questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite              
              useful for the development of algorithms.  This project makes                  
              serious use of both the theory and practice of symbolic                        
              calculations to solve real problems in group theory.
