Abstract    :
              9301345  Stanton  The research entails questions of geometry and analysis 
              concerning real hypersufaces in complex euclidean spaces.  Techniques involve
              heat kernel methods and asymptotic analysis  analogous to those employed in
              elliptic boundary value problems.  Problems concerning the rigidity of these
              hypersurfaces will also  be considered.  Such research has possible significant
               applications to branches of mathematical physics, particularly  general
              relativity theory.
