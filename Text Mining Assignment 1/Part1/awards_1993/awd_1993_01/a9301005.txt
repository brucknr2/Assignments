Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to research the earthquake-                   
              caused hazardous materials incidents that Japan has experienced,               
              the root cause of those problems, and the solutions developed as               
              a result.  The data obtained will be analyzed and compared to                  
              information that is available on U.S. earthquakes, especially the              
              Loma Prieta Earthquake.  Japanese codes and regulations that are               
              specifically aimed at reducing earthquake-caused hazardous                     
              materials incidents will be identified.  Organizations and                     
              regulatory bodies that are responsible for overseeing                          
              implementation of hazard reduction measures will be identified,                
              and their specific role examined.  The detailed information that               
              is available in Japan, combined with the information on the                    
              technical solutions developed in Japan, will be of value to U.S.               
              researchers and safety professionals interested in hazardous                   
              materials issues.  Based on the analysis, recommendations for                  
              hazard reduction efforts and future research will be formulated.               
              An annotated bibliography and a computerized data base of                      
              Japanese earthquake-caused hazardous materials incidents, a                    
              compilation of solutions developed, and a final report will be                 
              published.
