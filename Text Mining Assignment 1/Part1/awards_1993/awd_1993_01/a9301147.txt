Abstract    :
              Dr. Thomas J. Wandless has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Wandless' doctoral degree was from                
              Harvard University under the supervision of Professor Stuart                   
              Schreiber. Dr. Wandless will continue his research at Harvard                  
              Medical School under the sponsorship of Professor Christopher                  
              Walsh. Dr. Wandless' postdoctoral training will provide him                    
              with the tools of molecular biology necessary to study the                     
              interplay between protein kinases and phosphatases and how they                
              modulate distinct signal transduction pathways. Longer term, he                
              plans to study neuroactive peptides and their receptors,                       
              biological mechanisms of the action of natural products and the                
              role of carbohydrates in defining the strength and specifity of                
              protein-protein interactions.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
