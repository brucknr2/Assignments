Abstract    :
              9301986  Gokhale    The objective of this research is to develop general,
              unbiased,  efficient and practical stereological procedures for the 
              quantitative characterization of fracture surfaces and  microstructural
              features in three dimensional space from  measurements performed on l=lane
              sections or projected images.   This research involves analytical theoretical
              work, computer  simulations, computer-aided sampling experiments, software 
              development and experimental measurements.  Emphasis is on: (1)  local
              topographic features on fracture profiles directly from  digitized profile
              coordinate data; (2) topographic features related  to crack closure in metal
              alloys experiencing fatigue loading; (3)  quantitative analysis of microcrack
              fatigue damage in metal-matrix  composites; (4) sampling tests on digitized
              fracture profile data  to develop efficient sampling schemes.  %%%  This effort
              has practical applications in the description and  analysis of topographic
              surfaces in several fields including  materials science, biology, and botany.
